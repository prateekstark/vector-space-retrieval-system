<HEAD>Three Salvadoran Leftists Tortured, Slain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tortured, shot bodies of three members of a leftist party were found Tuesday in western <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a party spokesman said. He accused the military and demanded that those responsible be handed over for prosecution. Spokesman <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said that because of recent attacks, `` our leaders have ordered all party installations closed. ... The authorities are threatening us, they do not let us operate.'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Cecilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the movement's coordinator in western <LOCATION> Sonsonate </LOCATION> province, was kidnapped on Monday with two other party members. He said their bodies, showing signs of torture and bullet-riddled, were found on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sonsonate </LOCATION> city, the provincial capital 40 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, on Tuesday evening. Local judicial authorities ordered the three bodies buried as unidentified cadavers, but party members were able to identify them, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s age and the names and ages of the other two were not available immediately. `` Our comrades were seized by military officials dressed in civilian clothes after a meeting at the party hall -LRB- in <LOCATION> Sonsonate </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said, adding that they were killed `` in death-squad style'' and a hand-printed sign was found next to the bodies saying they had `` betrayed the fatherland.'' `` We hold those military officials dressed in civilian clothes responsible and we ask that the Sonsonate commander turn them over to judicial authorities,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. The commander is Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martel </PERSON>, a member of the party's national executive, told reporters: `` We do not have the least doubt the three were seized by soldiers dressed in civilian clothes.'' According to human rights organizations, most of the more than 70,000 people killed in a 10-year-old leftist guerrilla war have been civilians slain by rightist death squads that were especially active from 1979 to 1984. Death-squad activity sharply diminished in mid-1984 with the election of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a centrist Christian Democrat. Repression of leftists started again when rightist President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on June 1 for a five-year term. Leftists have often accused <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of being linked to the death squads, made up of off-duty military and security agents. A bomb wrecked the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 31, killing 10 people and wounding 29. Earlier that day, another bomb injured four people at <LOCATION> Comadres </LOCATION>, an organization of relatives of political prisoners and people who have disappeared in the civil war. Two of those injured in the blasts were Americans. Leaders of those two leftist groups accused the military of mounting the bombings in retaliation for an Oct. 30 mortar attack by the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> compound that killed one civilian and wounded 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1980 by dissidents who broke away from <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> home of party leader <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> was bombed Oct. 19, but no one was hurt. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a political coalition allied to the <LOCATION> Farabundo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marti </LOCATION> guerrillas. He long lived in exile but returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> two years ago when the <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> government promised an end to repression. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said that now the union halls, offices and other installations were being closed because the party does not want to see more members killed. To protest the attacks, <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> canceled its participation in a third meeting with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government representatives Nov. 20-21 in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, to negotiate a cease-fire. Earlier meetings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, ended in deadlock but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting at 30-day intervals until they could agree on some kind of a truce.

<HEAD>A Clubhouse Politician Reaches The Heights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is no political meteor, streaking suddenly across the civic firmament to seek office as the first black mayor of the nation's most populous city. He is a deliberate, courtly man who entered politics more than 30 years ago, working his way up the ladder one rung at a time _ clubhouse worker, assemblyman, district leader, city clerk, borough president. When he defeated three-term incumbent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in September's Democratic primary, the top of the ladder was within reach. On Tuesday, he defeated Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to become the 106th mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` What I do is provide hope,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, 62, said some months ago _ hope to other blacks who want to climb up the city's power structure. He is a soft-spoken, cordial man whose diction is perfect; a man who wears well-tailored suits, made in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>; an avid tennis player who is said to have a very strong forehand. Born in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the son of a barber, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> earned a bachelor's degree in math at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after a tour in the Marines. He went on to <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, graduating in 1956; he had already married <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, daughter of a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> assemblyman. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> joined a law firm, but also joined the <ORGANIZATION> Carver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> base of powerbroker <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who later became <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Democratic chairman, was mentor to a generation of black politicians, preaching a moderate course and encouraging compromise with the white establishment. In 1965, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was elected to the state Assembly. His seat was eliminated by reapportionment a year later, but in 1967 <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was elected a district leader from the <ORGANIZATION> Carver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a job he would retain for 20 years. In 1975, he was appointed city clerk. He ran three times for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president before winning the office in 1985. Though none of these jobs is all-powerful, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> used each post as a platform to speak out against discrimination and to support organized labor. He seldom took the spotlight, and he rarely made enemies. His one misstep was soon forgiven, though it came back to haunt him when he ran for mayor. In 1973, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was named deputy mayor for planning, but when a background check disclosed that he had failed to file income taxes for four years he was forced to give up the post. He paid $ 15,000 in back taxes and ascribed his actions to negligence. The omission was especially surprising given <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' legendary cautious nature. Before he announced his candidacy in February _ promising `` a different direction, new ideas and a fresh perspective'' _ he formed a committee to examine whether he should run. He ran as an unabashed liberal, but his was not a campaign brimming with position papers and brash promises. Instead, he focused on the need for reconciliation of the city's diverse population. He handily defeated <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in the primary, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the general election, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' taxes were an issue, as were his transfer of stock in a cable company to his son and his acceptance of a friend's gift of a free vacation to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. So too was his friendship with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is distrusted by many in the Jewish community. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> would not renounce <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but said the former presidential candidate was not an advisor; he reminded Jewish groups that he had condemned the anti-Semitism of Muslim Minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and his wife have lived in the same three-bedroom apartment in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for 26 years. They have two grown children and one grandchild.

<HEAD>Desert-Style Electioneering In Runup To First Nationwide Vote In
22 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MAAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young men wrestled a camel to the ground, slit its throat and butchered it for a banquet thrown by parliament candidate <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Arar </PERSON> in this desert town where bloody price riots broke out six months ago. Such rituals of rural campaigning in this sleepy town of 25,000 are partly the result of the violence that prompted King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to call the first nationwide elections in 22 years. There were few visible reminders of April's riots, just the occasional scar on the street where tires were set alight during unrest that left 10 people dead nationwide. The talk in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, was about Wednesday's elections and little else as local men met to chat with their friends in diwans, gatherings often held beneath goat's hair tents. Old men wearing red-and-white headdresses and younger ones in Western-style suits sat under one tent on a dusty lot beside <PERSON> Arar </PERSON>'s house sipping tea and smoking Arabic water pipes Among them was a local notable, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Turki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Krayshan </PERSON>, who called the elections for the 80-seat parliament `` a new page in our history, a new lease of life for our country.'' He said <PERSON> Arar </PERSON>, a former interior minister who most people in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION> call <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, `` will listen to the people, and he will present their requests to the parliament.'' The new parliament must approve all laws and budgets and it can even override the king's veto. It can also toss out the royally appointed Cabinet, a right spirited lawmakers exercised several times in the past. But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> remains the center of power, and he has the power to dissolve parliament and rule without it, as he has done for most of the past 15 years. A young man who helped slice the camel into chunks for the banquet said `` it's a special treat, and we'll be killing a lot more camels after <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wins the election.'' Twenty-eight candidates are competing for five seats in the sprawling Maan governorate. Another 13 are vying for two rural seats reserved for southern Bedouin tribes. The April violence in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION> was sparked by taxi drivers angry at a 25 percent increase in gasoline prices. But most of the rioters were young men frustrated by rising prices and a lack of jobs. At one diwan, a young man told a visiting reporter that `` the government must do something about unemployment and about public services here, which are not as good as in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>.'' But older tribesmen quickly urged him to quiet down. <PERSON> Turki </PERSON> denied that there was a gap between older leaders known as `` the sheiks'' and a younger generation of often better-educated Jordanians trying to break away from tribal influence. `` There are differences between the old people and the young,'' he acknowledged. `` But they're very slight. All the youth are with the sheiks.'' But columnist <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> daily that the influence of the sheiks appears to be eroding in some districts. She quoted one younger candidate as saying: `` Tribal leaders have had their chance. Look where it got them. `` Our rural areas have been neglected as far as educational, economic, social and cultural development projects are concerned. So why should they be given another chance?'' In <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>, local journalist <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoshman </PERSON> said tribal allegiances would be more potent in the elections than any political stands by the candidates. The Maan region has the largest area but the smallest population of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s governorates. Its 150,000 people are overwhelmingly of Bedouin stock and form the bedrock of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s support. The railroad that runs through Maan along the Islamic pilgrimage route to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> was repeatedly attacked by T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ during his campaign against the Turks alongside <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s ancestors during World War I. The southern Bedouins of the Howeitat tribe were famous for their bravery in the battles that helped put <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s grandfather, King <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, on the throne. `` His majesty the king is very popular here,'' said <PERSON> Turki </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was welcomed like a hero when he visited <PERSON> Maan </PERSON> after the riots. `` He can come here any time. There will be no problems,'' he said.

 A general from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> was jailed Monday for allegedly accepting bribes to release a drug plane impounded in his homeland. Gen. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pou </PERSON>, 54, who <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said had identified himself at different times as either an active or retired general, was ordered held without bond during an appearance Monday before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate. He was taken into custody when he arrived at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport, said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. `` All I can tell you he was arrested Sunday,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` He came to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in furtherance of the conspiracy.'' <PERSON> Pou </PERSON>, who had close contacts with other Dominican generals and aviation officials, allegedly received about $ 20,000 to release a confiscated plane, according to federal authorities. Also arrested for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guasch </PERSON>, 43, a Miami-based aide to the general, who was granted a $ 250,000 bond Monday. A third defendant, pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON>, was expected to turn himself in Tuesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, saying the investigation was continuing, refused to reveal many details of the case, but authorities released an affidavit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Agent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said in the affidavit that in February Customs and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began investigating `` allegations of the bribery of high-ranking military officials of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON> ... to assure the release of aircraft seized by the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> for narcotics smuggling.'' <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON> was also involved with officials in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, the affidavit said.

 Former USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailor <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> will share a $ 100,000 insurance claim with the family of a crewmate whom the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> concluded probably caused a deadly gun turret explosion, his attorney said Monday. Gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had named <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> as beneficiary for the life insurance policy taken out about a year ago. The connection initially focused <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators' attention on <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> after the April 19 disaster that killed 47 sailors, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was later cleared, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insists that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was the most likely cause of the explosion, possibly as part of a suicide. Settlement of the insurance policy was initially held up by <ORGANIZATION> Amex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because of a dispute between <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family. The money was paid Sept. 13 to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> filed a lawsuit, said <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON>, the insurer's spokeswoman. The dispute ended with Monday's agreement, releasing the $ 100,000, said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> refused to give details of the agreement. `` Some of the money will be paid to the <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> family in recognition of the loss of their son, and we are allocating an amount to the building of a memorial or monument to all 47 sailors who died,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` It's a very minimal sum, but we are not allowed to disclose how much,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister and spokeswoman for the family. She said her father was `` really upset.'' She said that <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> had told her parents they would get most of the money because it was such a large amount, `` but now he seems to have forgotten'' what he said. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family and <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> have challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusions <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said the insurance company `` did an investigation of their own and came to the conclusion there was no suicide or murder involved.'' `` If the insurance company thought he had committed suicide, they would not pay off the policy,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` It's another indication that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> theory of suicide by <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> will not hold water.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, now stationed at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a congressional committee investigating the explosion, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said, and would have no comment before then. The insurance policy named <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> as the beneficiary of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s $ 50,000 life insurance coverage, which had a double-indemnity clause for accidental death. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> filed a lawsuit Aug. 14 seeking payment from Amex. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> died in the explosion, while, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, on a lower floor of the gun turret, survived unhurt. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s official report by Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> cleared <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, and cited <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> as the most likely person to have caused the explosion, saying he apparently placed some type of detonator between powder bags while loading a 16-inch gun. Leaks from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation suggested that <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had a homosexual relationship that had gone sour. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who is married, strongly denied any sexual relationship with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> concluded there was no evidence <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was a homosexual.

<TEXT>
 Six Western states and the province of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Monday issued a proclamation urging their federal governments to take action to reduce drift net fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The proclamation was announced at a news conference preceding the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting this week in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The proclamation seeks reductions in Japanese high-seas salmon fisheries to reduce the impact of squid fleets on salmon, albacore tuna, seabirds and marine mammals. The proclamation also wants <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to establish a new convention in the ocean region aimed at protecting salmon in international waters. It would also form a research organization among the nations. The states are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Drift nets are small, monofilament nets that are draggd through the water and catch everything they come in contact with. About 800 fishing vessels from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> use the nets in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. On any given day, the drift net fleet can cover 30,000 miles of ocean. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the annual damage to fisheries on the high seas by drift net boats at about $ 100 million _ including the effects on salmon, albacore tuna and other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fisheries. Also Monday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nations at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in denouncing driftnet fishing as `` potentially devastating technology'' that massacres marine mammals, sea birds and unwanted fish. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, Ambassador <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which deals with the environment and other social affairs, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is joining the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and other nations in a resolution banning the huge drift nets. Under the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution, drift-net fishing would be abolished immediately in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and phased out worldwide by June 30, 1992. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no objection to developing nations using small drift nets that allow fish multiply and renew the stocks, but was opposed to the vast `` pelagic'' driftnets. The resolution is cosponsored by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. It does not single out any nation for criticism, but expresses concern of the indiscriminate nature of driftnet fishing and sets out proposals for international management and the eventual ban of driftnet use.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it was ceasing all passenger service immediately because a severe cash shortage doomed its bankruptcy reorganization plan. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the action was taken to preserve assets while <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> continues to develop alternatives, which might include selling the airline. `` We did n't come up with any other alternative financing and options like that. There just was n't any more cash,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, where the board of directors met Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> halted all passenger service at midnight Monday, but will continue and expand its charter airline service while <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> explores strategic alternatives, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said in a short statement released just before midnight. The last flights were arriving around midnight, and the planes would remain at their destinations indefinitely, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said employees at the Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will be notified individually about their status. Persons holding <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> tickets should check with other airlines, which may honor <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> tickets in some cases, the statement said. People holding tickets bought with a credit card were told to consult with the card company, and those who purchased tickets with cash or a check after Sept. 28 were advised to call a toll-free number for a refund. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which operated 46 of its 256 pre-bankruptcy flights Friday, was the first major carrier to file for bankruptcy following airline deregulation in the early 1980s. It emerged as a smaller carrier in 1984, but claimed weekly losses of about $ 1.5 million before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again on Sept. 28. It lost $ 31.8 million on revenue of $ 293 million in the first six months of the year. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 100 mostly administrative employees. It was scheduled to submit salary plans for its top executives in bankruptcy court Nov. 17. Last week, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, editor of the Dallas-based Commercial Aviation Report, said <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> needed $ 50 million to $ 100 million to operate on a long-term basis and could run out of cash sometime this month. `` I think executive salaries will all be a moot point very shortly,'' he said. `` Frankly, I'm surprised <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> is still flying.''

 A costly <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> radar plane envisioned as a key weapon in the war against drugs is plagued by electronics problems and ca n't reliably guide interceptors to drug-smuggling aircraft, agency documents say. `` Next month marks one year that we have been flying'' the first P-3 airborne early warning -LRB- AEW -RRB- aircraft, a Customs memo said on May 4, adding computer errors `` still make air intercept control a difficult task.'' In September, the plane's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would commit additional resources to `` upgrade'' the plane's computerized tracker. The equipment automatically plots the course and speed of other planes, and its inaccurate readings have been largely responsible for difficulties in intercepting planes suspected of smuggling drugs, according to the documents. `` You ca n't use the system for interception, and that's what all this magic is about,'' said a Customs source, adding that the P-3's computerized altitude, course and speed readings are so inaccurate that radar specialists worry they could direct their interceptors into a collision with a drug plane The source spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s airborne early warning program, said in an interview the firm is making improvements in the tracker because of `` anomalous behavior that we could not prevent. The plane is functioning but there are problems with it and we are correcting it. `` The airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their job,'' he said, adding the firm hopes to have the difficulties fixed by `` the first of the year.'' Other difficulties mentioned in the documents relate to the computer system that locates targets, faulty on-board communications for the crew, and problems with a spinning metal radar dome atop the plane. Difficulties aside, sources speaking on condition of anonymity said reports critical of the plane's performance were ordered rewritten by an agency supervisor after one early test. The P-3 <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION>'s are designed to play a major role in drug interdiction from their <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The government's multi-agency <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reports 51 percent of the 112,000 kilograms of cocaine seized during 1988 arrived by air _ 45 percent in private planes. Despite the shortcomings detailed in the documents, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON>, acting director of <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> surveillance center, called the aircraft `` a cost-effective piece of equipment, giving taxpayers one of best bangs for the buck in government today. It works and it works great.'' He said the system for tracking smugglers has a `` few glitches'' that can be solved. The first P-3 <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> aircraft has experienced both electronic and mechanical difficulties since the $ 27 million plane arrived at the Customs Surveillance Support Center in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> in June 1988, according to the documents. The documents show some of the problems afflicted a second P-3 that arrived in April at a cost of $ 30.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has approved $ 35 million for a third P-3. The P-3 Orion has been used for years as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> anti-submarine detection plane, but the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plane contains specially designed electronics for the drug war. Identification of the authors of most of the documents was obscured by sources who made the material available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The majority of documents were written by P-3 crew members, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> was told. The difficulties diminish one of the most important features of the four-engine turboprops: the ability to use the multi-colored computer displays, with their impressive interchangeable graphics, to direct <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> planes intercepting and pursuing the flying smugglers. <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON> said the two P-3 <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION>'s were mainly responsible for detections leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10 this year. Seizures included 37,000 pounds of marijuana, 8,300 pounds of cocaine, 17 vessels and vehicles and three aircraft, he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berezonsky </PERSON>, project manager for the <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> program at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview the plane's problems `` have n't prevented the aircraft from doing a hell of a job'' and result from `` trying to put so much information on display to the operator so quickly We can track a greater number of targets simultaneously than anyone operating an <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> aircraft now. That's the key.'' Yet the documents, and interviews with those knowledgeable with the program, said the mission has been hampered in a number of ways: _ Planes that were possibly 300 miles away appeared as nearby targets Single targets were displayed as multiple images. Targets were lost when the P-3's on-board computer system `` crashed.'' Ships appeared at altitudes of 15,000 feet. _ The spinning radar dome atop the plane, similar to that on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> AWACS, stopped working when the plane's speed reached 270 knots _ Agency officials accepted the first plane without the test flights designed by experts to create what a memo called `` real world'' conditions The test plan, included in the documents, would have evaluated the radar equipment over every possible terrain, trying to see how well it detected other Customs aircraft playing the role of drug-smuggler planes. The evaluation was flown months after Customs accepted the aircraft. _ The P-3's experienced numerous communications problems Radar specialists in the back of the plane were unable to monitor pilots' transmissions, a handicap that would _ according to a memo _ `` hinder safety of flight, and impede crew coordination. A memo warned of the potential for a `` <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- no radio -RRB- situation,'' a total communications failure. _ Two crewmen at <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> were ordered to water down their highly critical reports of the first P-3's performance during a then-top secret mission in late July-early August 1988 to detect drug planes leaving <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> One of the initial reports of the plane's first operational test said, `` The -LRB- tracking -RRB- program is so inaccurate'' the radar specialists `` had to develop alternate procedures to detect and track targets.'' The aircraft tracker problem was an important part of the evaluation of Operation Barrier, the mission to detect Colombian drug planes completed in early August 1988. There are at least four reports: two highly critical, and more favorable versions of the originals. A <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> source speaking on condition of anonymity said both original versions were ordered rewritten by a supervisor in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. One of the originals, dated Aug. 2, 1988, said the computer `` crashed'' at `` irregular intervals'' and communications improvements were needed `` so the next three aircraft will not be ` communications cripples.''' It added that `` deficiencies in the tracking program'' required use of antiquated `` raw radar'' to `` verify the validity'' of the computer displays and to `` provide accurate intercept data.'' After the rewrite was ordered, the same author wrote on Aug. 17, 1988, the operation was `` a complete success'' in which `` systems reliability was superb.'' He concluded, `` the potential of this asset is unlimited.''

 A federal appeals court has upheld government rulings that the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acted improperly in cutting salaries by 15 percent in 1986 and firing four employees who criticized the newspaper in a letter to advertisers. The two 3-0 rulings by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which were made public Monday, were victories for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> in disputes stemming from negotiations with the newspaper in 1986. An agreement was recently announced to sell the newspaper to a group headed by <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> developers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuti </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucerman </PERSON>, one of the four employees fired over the letter, said he expected the decisions and felt vindicated. `` I'm very pleased. I hope the employer would now swiftly implement the court's order and give everybody their 15 percent,'' said <PERSON> Saucerman </PERSON>, who was a retail advertising salesman. But <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Union President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said the newspaper will appeal both rulings to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said 170 to 180 employees were affected. `` We believe very strongly that we were at impasse'' in contract negotiations and had the right to implement the pay cut, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` We also believe very strongly that we had the right to fire those -LRB- four -RRB- people on the basis of their actions.'' The Guild, representing editorial, circulation, business, advertising and maintenance employees, negotiated with the newspaper in 1986 on a contract to replace the one that was to expire that May. The talks continued beyond May, but in early August 1986 the newspaper declared an impasse and put its last offer into effect, including an across-the-board 15 percent pay cut and elimination of a longstanding provision requiring all employees to join the Guild. The union denied that negotiations were at an impasse, as required for an employer to implement its final contract offer. A hearing officer ruled in the newspaper's favor but was overruled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, whose decision was upheld by the appeals court. The court said there was evidence to support the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that no real bargaining had taken place on the key issue of union security when the talks were suspended When the security issue was raised, `` the company put the matter off to a later time and then declared an impasse before any real discussion took place,'' the court said. It rejected the newspaper's argument that the Guild had refused to discuss the issue. The court upheld the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s order requiring the newspaper to reinstate the former contract, which included the higher pay level and the union membership requirement. The unsigned ruling was issued by Judges <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Skopil </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. The other ruling involved a letter written by four members of the <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiating committee to 50 of the newspaper's advertisers in October 1987 The letter described the employees' efforts to get a contract, mentioned the pay cut, and declared that the paper was `` speeding downhill,'' with circulation plummeting and good staffers leaving. The advertisers were urged to contact executives of the newspaper. The court said the four employees _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucerman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canfield </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> _ were fired two weeks later. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> accused them of disloyalty and said the letter contained falsehoods that disrupted the newspaper's relationship with advertisers, the court said. In an opinion by <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, the court upheld the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that the letter was within the employees' rights of collective bargaining and was not an improper act of disloyalty.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> are proving that love and marriage really do go together like a horse and carriage. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 58, who runs a horse-drawn carriage business in the <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> tourist area, knew Ms. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was the woman for him the moment the 60-year-old <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> woman got into his carriage while vacationing with her father and stepmother recently. `` The first thing the driver said to me was, ` Would you like to go for a cruise, go out to dinner or get married?''' Ms. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> recalled. `` Well, it was just foolishness so I said, ` I'd rather get married.''' `` The moment I spotted her beautiful brown eyes, I knew that this is it,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` I've waited 18 years for a woman like her. I've prayed to the Lord for it and he finally sent me an angel.'' It was a whirlwind romance after that first carriage ride. After a breakfast date the next day, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s father for her hand. `` My father said: ` Well, she's 60 years old, she ought to be able to make up her own mind,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a registered nurse. The date has n't been set, but the wedding, the second for each, will be as soon as possible.

 Tired of scrounging under the car seat for change to drop in the parking meter? This city is considering introducing the latest in convenience for the motorist on the go: the personal parking meter. If the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> goes along with the proposal today, drivers would be offered pocket computer-sized devices that automatically keep track of parking time in metered zones. The `` Parkulators'' would sell for $ 50, and be dumped in the trash when $ 50 worth of curb time is used up. `` It's your own personal parking meter,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, city parking manager. `` We get complaints constantly: ` If I only had enough change on me or had some way to prepay the meter, I would n't have gotten this ticket.' Now they wo n't have that excuse.'' Motorists would be responsible for turning the units on and punching in the maximum time allowed at whatever meter they've pulled up to If they do n't, or if they fail to come back and punch in another deposit when the time's up, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said, they'll get tickets just like an old-fashioned meter scofflaw.

 <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an ex-convict sterlized by the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a teen-ager who turned his life around and became a prominent anti-crime consultant, has died. He was 62. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> died Sunday night at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> hospital. He had undergone serveral surgical procedures and was in ill health for the past year, said a longtime friend, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s life was the basis for a television movie. In and out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> juvenile institutions from the age of 7, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was sterlized at age 17 under a theory that juvenile delinquency could be eradicted by ensuring that teen-age offenders did n't have children. The <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, native moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> at age 1. He served time in juvenile and adult institutions for auto theft, burglary and escape, but most of his criminal career involved armed robbery. While doing time at Folsom Prison for armed robbery, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and two other inmates became the first maxiumum-security prisoners to escape from the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> facility in 1958. The three were recaptured. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> spent the next four years in solitary confinement. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> newspaper reporter who met <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> while covering jails and prisons, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> never liked small places after that. `` He once had an apartment and it drove him nuts,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who used to claim the late <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirable </PERSON> as his godfather, turned his life around after his parole in 1968. He returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and worked for the old county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camps </ORGANIZATION>, then as a research associate for <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>, also became an internationally known anti-crime lecturer who spoke frequently to business and civic groups. Among the law-enforcement organizations he addressed were the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. In 1978, Gov. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> a full pardon. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> made about three dozen appearances as a guest on `` The Tonight Show,'' and regarded host <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> as a good friend and a major influence, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was honored by Mayors <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who declared days in his honor in 1978 and 1988, respectively. When he died, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was working on a robbery - and violence-prevention program for small businesses and a similar program to help the elderly `` If we need proof that it's possible for a person to change, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was that proof. I would n't have liked the old <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> co-wrote a 1975 autobiography, `` Too Dangerous To Be At Large,'' which was a reference to one of Superior Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewicker </PERSON>'s comments to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> when he was sentenced to prison for the last time. The book was the basis for a television movie, `` Dangerous Company,'' in which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s role was played by <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also had a bit part in the network movie, playing a prison guard. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON>, and his mother, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarry </PERSON>.

 No one really knows what happened to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON>. Two weeks ago he was a well-respected police chief in this tough shoemakers' town that gave the world <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciano </PERSON> and championship football teams. Then, on Oct. 24, <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> was arrested for allegedly taking cocaine from the police department's evidence room to support his five-year addiction. At his arraignment, prosecutors said <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> confessed he was a cocaine addict. The 22-year police veteran, who once headed the department's anti-drug unit, also is being investigated in connection with hundreds of thousands of dollars missing from operating funds and money from seized drug deals, court documents show. The news has taken people's breath away. Sproules, 45, was a light for this blue-collar city's 93,000 residents some 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. With drug-related crime a daily reality and racial tension a constant presence, they looked to him often. <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s local president, met Sproules more than 10 years ago after racial graffiti was scrawled over a neighborhood church. `` He was very sensitive to people's needs _ all kinds of people's needs,'' she said. `` He made you feel like a friend and his door was always open.'' That open door, and the way <LOCATION> Sproules </LOCATION> refused to concede defeat without a battle, may have been his undoing, friends and colleagues said. Between heading a 185-member police force, setting up neighborhood crime watch patrols, acting as a liaison on various community boards, guiding high school counselors, coaching pre-teen soccer, his plate was full. When he got home to his wife and two kids at night, it was after hours of doling out advice and hearing people's problems. `` He was called upon so much _ maybe it was too much,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. `` He might have been under stress and we did n't know it. He never showed it.'' Everyone agrees, <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> never let on that anything was bothering him. Since the news broke, officers down at the department have been dazed. At the bar, people drain beers while discussing <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON>' alleged secret life and speculating on his fall from grace `` The overriding thing was the intensity of their reaction,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a talk show host at <ORGANIZATION> WBET </ORGANIZATION> radio, who threw open his mike the evening the Sproules story broke. `` In a lot of cases we were knocking people off their chairs with this ... it was the last thing anybody expected to hear. They needed to talk and let off some steam.'' Perhaps what people find most disconcerting is the fact that <LOCATION> Sproules </LOCATION>, an authority figure, could succumb to an everyday human frailty. `` If it can happen to him it can happen to anyone,'' people said again and again. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Franciosi </PERSON>, a junior high school principal, is still trying to figure out how the police chief, a friend and adviser to whom many students turned, could have sunk into the very hell he was trying to eradicate. `` It's been like a car accident or some other kind of tragedy,'' he said. `` It's easy to say ` That's terrible, but it's not going to happen to someone we know,' `` he said. `` Now we know that assumption's just not true.'' Cocaine, like many drugs, can be extremely addictive and <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON>' work drew him daily into temptation's way until eventually co-workers suspected him and an internal investigation was launched. <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> was suspended with pay and subsequently resigned. He was freed on his own recognizance after pleading innocent to the drug charges. He talked only briefly following his arrest. `` I was always helping other people,'' he said. `` But I never found time for myself. Maybe that was my problem.'' Authorities have convened an investigative grand jury to examine evidence against <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON>, who last week admitted himself to a four-week drug rehabilitation program was not available for comment. His attorney, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmands </PERSON>, did not return telephone messages left at his office. If convicted, <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> could face more than 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a local carpenter and friend who spoke recently with Sproules, said the chief in some ways has been set free. `` The man feels like there's a 3,000-pound weight off his soul _ that finally he does n't have to lie anymore,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Congress Gives Agencies `Open Money Sack' to Hire Consultants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is giving federal agencies `` an open money sack'' to hire private consultants and contractors, and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> even lets them perform sensitive work on nuclear technology, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report says. The Department of Energy relies on private consultants `` to perform virtually all basic governmental functions,'' according to a report released Monday by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee The number of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees has declined from 20,000 in 1980 to 16,000, the report said, adding that contractors have in effect become part of its permanent work force. `` It relies on contractors in the preparation of its most important plans and policies, the development of budgets and budget documents, and the drafting of reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and congressional testimony,'' the report said. `` It relies on contractors to monitor arms control negotiations, help prepare decisions on the export of nuclear technology, and conduct hearings and initial appeals in challenges to security clearance disputes,'' it said. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said the department was unable to say how many contractors and consultants it has, or how much it is spending on them. But he said the department pays more for work by consultants than it would for the same work by employees. `` We spend in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> weeks debating whether government employees should get a 2 percent or a 3.6 percent pay raise, but we provide literally an open money sack to agencies to hire private contractors,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, assistant energy secretary for management and administration, defended the use of consultants and contractors as necessary to provide technical expertise that the government can not obtain from its own employees. She said the department's employees `` are stretched very thin,'' and that government salaries are too low to keep employees who can be hired at higher salaries by the contractors. But she said the department uses only its own employees to make policy decisions. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> acknowledged the panel's finding that remarks by Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel in April on nuclear facilities had been written by a private defense contractor, <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION>. But she said that was an `` isolated'' incident. The report was written by the staff of <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee on federal services, post office and civil service, which has been looking into use of consultants by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said many of the consultants and contractors also do business with private energy companies or foreign governments and companies. `` The potential for a conflict of interest is unchecked,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, director of procurement and contract management for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, defended <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s use of outside contractors in testimony before the panel. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget for contracts tripled during the 1980s

<HEAD>New Rules Simplify Shopping for a Home Equity Loan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The confusing task of choosing a home equity loan should be easier starting today under new federal rules requiring lenders to disclose in advance the interest rate, fees and other terms they're offering. Federal Reserve regulations, voluntary since June 7, became mandatory today. In addition to advance disclosure, the law curbs misleading advertising and other abusive practices. `` Simple, easily understood and easily comparable information will be available to consumers to intelligently shop around for a home equity loan,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chief sponsor of the legislation passed late last year that directed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to write the rules. Lenders now must disclose basic cost information when borrowers make an initial inquiry and again when the loan application is filed. Another provision targets deeply discounted `` teaser'' rates that offer borrowers a break on their first few payments before the rates rise sharply. Lenders can still advertise teaser rates, but they must give equal prominence to the interest rate borrowers will be paying after the discount expires. The rules forbid contract clauses permitting lenders to call in the loan, accelerate payments or raise the interest rate at whim. Adjustable-rate home equity loans now must be based on an index outside the lender's control, such as the prime rate published in newspapers, not the lender's own prime rate. Consumer advocates were pleased with the law, sponsored in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., but they complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> regulations do not fully live up to their spirit Consumer's Union, a national organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, filed suit last week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeking to close what it considers several loopholes. The group opposes a provision in the law that requires lenders in the first pre-application disclosure to reveal only the index on which a floating interest rate is based, but not the margin, or difference between the rate charged and the index. `` We think the margin is an integral part of the cost that consumers need to know. We also think the legislation expressly requires lenders to disclose the margin,'' said attorney <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> of Consumers Union. Bankers are generally satisfied with the law, recognizing it was needed to curb at least isolated abuses. But, according to <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, regulatory affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the disclosures may swamp borrowers with too much detail. One provision, for instance, requires the lender to provide a chart showing how the interest rate and minimum monthly payment would have varied over the past 15 years. `` It gets confusing,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` People do n't care what happened 15 years ago. They want to know what's happening today and what their payment is going to be tomorrow.'' The popularity of home equity loans has surged since the 1986 tax law began phasing out the deductibility of consumer loans. Home loans, however, are still fully deductible, including home equity loans in most instances. This year, only 20 percent of non-mortgage interest is deductible; in 1990 only 10 percent is eligible and beginning in 1991 none will be. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said outstanding revolving home equity loans totaled $ 26.3 billion at mid-October, up from $ 21 billion a year earlier and $ 11.7 billion in June 1987, when the agency first began keeping track. According to a survey of 138 lenders by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the delinquency and foreclosure rates for home equity loans were lower this year than for regular first mortgages. But, consumer advocates have always been leery of home equity loans and say they have n't been tested during an economic downturn. Defaults could soar in a recession, they contend. The Better Business Bureau says home equity loans should be used only for major expenditures such as college education, home improvement or for major medical expenses, not for luxuries such as sports cars.

 The chairmen of two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that oversee natural resources issues are urging their colleagues to reject <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> as assistant secretary of agriculture.

He has drawn fire for his record as a high-ranking official during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where critics contend he put private development interests ahead of environmental concerns. `` A review of Mr. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s education and employment history indicates that he came to the Department of the Interior with little, if any, by the way of background or qualifications for the job,'' said the letter, dated Nov. 3. `` Moreover, Mr. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s record indicates a reluctance to rely on the professional expertise available to him at the Department of the Interior,'' it says. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> opposed <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> during committee hearings, saying he repeatedly shrugged aside public interests in decisions on how to use public lands. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who is widely admired on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, has sought to assure senators that he sets environmental policy at the department and <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> would be taking orders from him. But <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> cited testimony critical of <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> from <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who retired recently as chief of the forest service after 38 years with the agency and currently holds the title chief emeritus. `` In my judgment, he -LRB- <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> -RRB- clearly is not qualified,'' the senators quote <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> as saying. `` The opposition to Mr. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s nomination is broad and deep, and ranges across political and ideological viewpoints,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` It is opposition based on the recognition that we need appointees who are dedicated to protecting the public trust, whatever their party.'' The nomination was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 12-7 vote, but full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action was been put on hold because of opposition to the appointment.

 Federal subsidies would be available to cities that start tree-planting programs if a bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> becomes law.

It directs the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to start a matching grants program that would provide cash, services or in-kind contributions for up to 50 percent of the cost of any tree-planting program.

 It took <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> seven years, but he's finally convinced the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to change their maps of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to reflect historical fact and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy It's a story about a persistent advocate, a cumbersome bureaucracy and the intractable Israeli-Arab conflict. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, began his crusade in 1981 when he noticed that a government-published map book showed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. This was despite the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and most of the rest of the world have never recognized <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 1950 annexation of the 2,200-square-mile territory. On the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maps published by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli-Jordanian border was drawn along the 1949 armistice line, which defined <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s physical borders until the 1967 war. The maps did not reflect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capture of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in that war and the new cease-fire lines created as a result. `` It was n't right. It just did n't reflect reality,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. He undertook his campaign in a methodical way, buying a computer and poring over history books and archive documents, far from the controversy generated by every wrinkle of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute. The first step was a letter to then-Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. The retired general referred <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s letter to a little-known <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> entity called the Office of the Geographer. The office maps official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on sovereignty issues for internal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publications, and acts as an advisory and arbitration board for other government agencies that issue maps. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> began corresponding with the geographer, who issued a directive in 1982 ordering cartographers to stop showing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as anyone's territory. But still, the public maps were not changed. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also enlisted his congressman's help, wrote opinion pieces and editorial letters, but the maps were still wrong. Finally, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked to see <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s successor at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, whom he had known when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. `` That was very exciting,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He left <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> with 92 documents buttressing his argument. More conversations with administration officials and letters followed. In 1984, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> read an opinion piece in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> by former deputy <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who said the agency was emphasizing accuracy and objectivity in its assessments. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> decided to call <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, talking his way past skeptical aides and secretaries until he got through. `` I told him his people were not adhering to his standards,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Two days later, on Jan. 2, 1985, he was summoned to a meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials. They promised the maps would be changed, but a year later nothing had been done, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> called again _ and this time a promise was fulfilled. The map of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was changed in 1986. It took until January 1989 to change the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> map. The new maps show the 1967 cease-fire line between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> designated as two cultural regions _ <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION>. The two biblical names are also used by Israeli nationalists to describe the region. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s efforts also bore fruit outside government circles when the Encyclopedia Britannica changed its maps, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reluctant to give all the credit to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for the changes, but concedes his campaign influenced the decision. `` He was very, very active, and believed in his cause,'' said one official familiar with the case. Perhaps the best tribute to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s determination was contained in a letter from <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> earlier this year, soon after the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maps were changed. `` <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>,'' wrote the man who labored in vain for six years to bring about Israeli-Arab peace talks. `` I'm glad you kept at it and accomplished something that is of genuine and lasting significance.''

 Mimicking an overnight decline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, share prices fell on a broad front today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's key indicator, fell 163.54 points, or 0.46 percent, to close at 35,470.26. It lost 60.86 points Monday. The overnight decline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average of 30 major issues posted its third-largest single-day decline this year of 47.34 points, sparked a broad round of selling, driving the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> down 301.22 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. Dealers said investors in both markets were reacting with disappointment over fading prospects for an interest-rate cut following Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless figures, which showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate unchanged from a month earlier at 5.3 percent. A quarterly auction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities to begin today in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also kept some participants on the sidelines, they said. The Nikkei recovered some of its early losses later in the day as investors bought popular issues such as petroleum and mining shares as well as some incentive-backed issues, dealers said. A estimated 750 million shares changed hands in moderately active trading, up from 611 million shares Monday. In currency trading, the dollar closed at 143.63 yen, up 0.18 yen from Monday's close of 143.45 yen. It opened at 143.85 yen and ranged between 143.53-144 .04 The dollar closed at 143.88 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight. The dollar surged against the yen in early trading following an upswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Many investors bought the dollar in early trading,'' he said, `` but their buying incentive was not strong enough to keep pushing the dollar beyond the 144-yen line.'' Demand for the dollar due to today's <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction bolstered the dollar later in the day as it came under selling pressure from security houses and life insurance companies, said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Rumors of an imminent rate hike by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> are putting downward pressure on the dollar,'' <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said. Traders said the dollar-yen rate is unlikely to move much ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price index for October on Thursday.

 A man prosecutors say is a major heroin trafficker testified he paid another accused drug dealer in a plot to assassinate <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s former leader, who died in a mysterious plane crash. Federal prosecutors allege that <PERSON> Mushtaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, a 41-year-old Pakistani on trial on charges of conspiracy and importation of heroin, arranged for <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, to bring $ 10 million in heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for resale. <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> with heroin nearly two years ago, authorities said. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> is known as `` The Black Prince,'' and they allege he is one of the world's biggest heroin traffickers. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> testified Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that he had hired <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> to kill Pakistani President Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> did not make clear whether the assassination plot he said he was involved in had anything to do with the crash. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, a self-described Pakistani prince, said <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> was a former colonel in the Jordanian army. `` I do n't know anything about money for heroin in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> was summoned to testify by his attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrarone </PERSON>. He was scheduled for cross-examination today by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> testified he advanced Houchaimi $ 1 million on behalf of superiors in the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ whose current leader is Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> _ to secure personnel and equipment for the assasination. The 51-year-old <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> testified last week that he had been given 2 kilograms of heroin in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to sell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>. <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> was arrested with a nylon handbag filled with the heroin on Feb. 6, 1988, near a downtown bus terminal, authorities said. Six months later, on Aug. 17, 1988, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a plane crash that also killed 29 other people, including <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>.

 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> says part of an insurance investigator's report on ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 shows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was warned an hour before takeoff about a possible bomb. The plane blew up last December over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground. The airline has been sued for more than $ 300 million. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he has a report indicating the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> got a warning from West German intelligence about a suspicious suitcase on the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> termed the report `` nonsense,'' and administration officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not warned about a Flight 103 bomb by any foreign intelligence agency. On Monday, <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> passed out five pages from what he said was a 27-page report prepared for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance company. The document says a West German agent watching baggage handlers singled out one suspicious suitcase and reported `` something was very wrong.'' West German intelligence passed on the concern to a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, which relayed it to an unidentified `` control,'' says the excerpt. `` Control replied: ` Do n't worry about it, do n't stop it, let it go,''' the excerpt says.

 Former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is being lampooned by the White House for suggesting that cocaine and other drugs should be legalized. `` Whoa, he's been out on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> too long, has n't he?'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. `` The guy slips into retirement and right away he starts saying things that are strange.''

President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels very strongly that that is the wrong direction at the wrong time; that it is not a moral position for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take; and that it makes no sense whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said legalizing drugs is something that `` everyone is scared to talk about. No politician wants to say -LRB- it -RRB- ...'' His views were published in The Wall Street Journal Oct. 27 in an adaptation of remarks he made to an alumni gathering at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Oct. 7. He said that attacking drugs with a criminal justice approach `` is not likely to work.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it. `` Frankly,'' he added, `` the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost. `` When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives, including ... the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves. They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market. `` ... We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> served as secretary of state for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from July 1982 until January 1989, when he returned to the faculty at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

 Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> admits his dream of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> strike force to combat drug cartel terrorism lacks necessary political support, but he says he will keep up his crusade for the idea. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that a Western hemisphere training center for agents and intelligence could serve as an alternative _ but only an international strike force would really do the job. `` It is n't a regional problem, it's an international problem,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said in pitching for an eight-point program aimed at fighting the narcotics scourge. He said the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or some other international group might be interested in sponsoring such a project. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> was preaching his gospel to a friendly audience. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., is a leading congressional supporter of the concept of a multinational force to combat the drug cartels `` The strike force plan could turn the rhetoric about apprehending drug kingpins into a reality _ and yet to my amazement we have not had a firm recommendation by the administration on this plan,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said quite a few governments have been skeptical about the idea of allowing foreign troops on their soil, even if by invitation and under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices as called for under his plan. After the hearing he met for 20 minutes with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to discuss the drug problem. Before leaving for that session he told reporters it would be `` too ambitious'' to expect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration support for the idea of a multinational force. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> likened the strike force to paramilitary forces established a decade ago to fight aircraft hijackers and urban guerrillas in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The unit, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said, would be used where drug lords `` create a terror in society and -LRB- try to -RRB- break its will to fight them.'' He said it might be possible to get action soon on the seven other points in his anti-drug program. The package includes a central intelligence-gathering system, a school for narcotics agents and an international reserve pool of narcotics agents and intelligence operatives. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said the seven other pieces of the package were actually more important if taken in total than the proposed paramilitary force, although the idea of such an elite unit has drawn most of the spotlight.

Authorities said 28-year-old <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> started firing a shotgun at his relatives in his mother's home after an argument. `` He wiped his family out. I just do n't understand. We may never know why it happened,'' <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The shootings occurred at the home of <ORGANIZATION> Polly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> in the southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and his 20-year-old wife, <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON>, had gone to his mother's house to do laundry Monday afternoon, said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON>. After the argument began, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> shot the two women in the head, killing both, <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>'s 33-year-old sister, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, ran outside to lead their blind brother, <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON>, to safety.

<HEAD>Latin American Incomes Dropped in `Lost Decade'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1980s are a lost decade for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with a drop of individual incomes that threatens the establishment of democracy, according to Brazilian President <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. He also saw damage to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries. `` Various sources estimated that the drop in imports by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than 900,000 jobs between 1980 and 1987, including both the jobs that disappeared and those which could have been created if <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> had not had to curb their imports,'' he said. The organization's general assembly meets in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a week beginning Monday, with 32 governments represented. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will have its first popular election for president in 29 years on Nov. 15. `` For many groups of people, the reduction of income and the lack of jobs have been added to previous frustrations, so that there is a serious lack of basic necessities,'' he told the executive committee that was preparing the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> session. `` This situation is certainly a threat to the stability of the democracies that are in the process of consolidating themselves.'' He said that in 1988, in the worst crisis since the 1930s, average income was down 1.6 percent _ bringing it to the level of 1978. All except five countries saw incomes decline, and in nine countries the level was down to that of 20 years before. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the average income was calculated at $ 4,543 last year, the same as in 1964. <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> noted there had been serious disturbances this year because of the economic situation. He did not name countries but was clearly referring to last February's riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in which hundreds of people were killed, and the agitation in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> that brought the resignation of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> before the end of his term. The committee calculated the outflow of cash as totalling $ 204 billion since 1980, peaking at $ 35 billion in 1985, then declining for two years but rising again to $ 31.5 billion in 1988. It laid the blame on a marked reduction in the flow of capital from abroad, the high level of Latin American payments on foreign debt and the flight of capital from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` safe havens'' abroad. It quoted figures to show <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, for example, spent 20 percent of its budget on education in 1972 but only 6 percent in 1986. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> spent 5.1 percent on health in 1972 and only 1.4 percent in 1986. `` The lack of government spending on things like education and health have disproportionately severe effect on the lowest income groups in the member states,'' the report said. `` The poor do not have the means for private health care and education when public services are no longer available.''

<HEAD>Facts And Figures On Namibia And Its Pre-Independence Elections</HEAD>
<UNK>With Namibia, Bjt</UNK>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are some facts about the elections being held in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> today through Saturday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE VOTING _ <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 701,483 registered voters will choose a 72-member constituent assembly that is to draft a constitution for the country when it becomes independent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> next year. Assembly seats will be assigned on a proportional basis, according to each party's share of the total vote.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE VOTERS _ Namibians over 18 were eligible to register if they or their parents were born in the territory, or if they have lived in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for four years. More than 40,000 exiles, mostly supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, returned on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flights to participate. About 12,000 white South Africans are qualified to vote. Sixty percent of Namibians are illiterate and the ballots show symbols next to the party names.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE CANDIDATES _ Ten political parties have submitted candidate lists, from which the assembly members will be chosen. The top contenders are <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which waged a war against South African occupation from 1966 until April; and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition which participated in the territorial government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 KEY ISSUE _ <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is expected to win the most votes, but a key question is whether it will win the two-thirds majority needed to write a constitution without consulting other parties.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 GEOGRAPHY _ The 318,252-square-mile territory is mostly desert, with scattered deposits of valuable minerals. A 1981 census recorded a population of 1.3 million, but the return of refugees and the growth rate of 2.7 percent a year makes the figure outdated. The population is predominantly black, divided among seven major ethnic divisions, plus Bushmen, mixed-race groups, and 75,000 whites. The territory is bounded by the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since capturing the territory of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1915. U.N. Resolution 435, adopted in 1978, established the process for `` free and fair elections.'' It was implemented April 1, 1989, after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> brokered an agreement calling for South African and Cuban troop withdrawals from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases were located.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ROLE _ <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, the South African administrator of the territory, is in charge of the elections, while <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Special Representative <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> has the task of declaring whether the voting has been free and fair. Territorial police, watched by 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors, were guarding the polls to prevent violence. Another 6,150 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and officials were on hand as well as 1,000 observers from 25 countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE RESULTS _ The ballots are to be counted at regional centers and results are expected on or after Nov. 15. U.N. Resolution 435 does not specify a procedure for formation of an independent government once the constitution is written.

<HEAD>Agreement to Increase US-Japan Air Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One hundred more weekly passenger flights to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are expected under a new agreement officials say will only begin to meet the huge demand in the nation's most lucrative aviation market. A one-third increase in flights both ways and a similar boost in cargo service between the two countries will begin after most of the agreement takes effect next October, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The department will decide which airlines and cities are to get the increased flights. The formal pact, being completed this week after an `` agreement in principle'' was signed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Sunday, will open the way for other airlines to apply for flights to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and for up to six additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to be served by flights to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and other Japanese cities. It also encourages more flights to land in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and adds new flights between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saipan </LOCATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said it was the most significant aviation agreement between the two countries in 37 years. He said it would boost travel, trade and tourism across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Agreement came after four years of talks and six days of intense negotiations involving <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> department officials. Neither side got as many flights as it wanted, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, transportation assistant secretary for policy and international affairs. `` That's good because it means both sides remain hungry,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said, adding this would increasing chances that even more flights can be added in the future. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said the Japan-U.S. route generates about $ 6 billion in revenue for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, with the number of passengers increased 20 percent a year and cargo 30 percent a year over the past two years. He said passenger flights between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are usually full. `` We have a desperate need for more capacity,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said. `` This allows us to respond far more effectively to the immediate demands for service in this market.'' Six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and three Japanese airlines currently fly between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> declined to say what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities might be added or what airlines might apply for the new routes, but said competition would be keen. He said the department's policy is to increase airline competition, and this could be a factor in deciding which carriers will be approved. The pact gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines three new passenger and cargo routes to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, three to other Japanese cities and an additional all-cargo service. Both Federal Express and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> now fly cargo planes to and from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Reciprocal routes would be awarded to Japanese airlines, allowing some routes to extend beyond one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city. The agreement still will not allow Japanese airlines to carry passengers from one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city to another. Charter cargo and passengers flights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers will be increased from 300 to 450 a year, and Japanese shippers will also be able to increase flights beginning Jan. 1. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have more U.S.-Japan flights than Japanese airlines, and the balance will remain in favor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said. The agreement would increase weekly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights carrying both passengers and cargo from 151 to 200, Japanese flights from 95 to 146. Cargo flights would increase from 39 a week for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers to 53 and from 27 for Japanese cargo haulers to 37. The figures include only westbound flights, with nearly all flying the other way, as well. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will be added as a possible stop for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese airlines flying between the two countries. The state's economy has suffered from a decrease in air service as more flights bypass it in order to preserve other landing rights

 TV viewers can find women panting over `` hunks'' or pairing up with unlikely male love interests but they wo n't find any strong female role models among 26 new network shows this year, a women's group says. Nor will they find any breakthroughs in portraying minorities or find more women behind the cameras, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Unlike years past, `` No strong female leads emerge. No workplace dramas or comedies either break new ground or provide compelling role models,'' the group said after surveying the 26 new 1989 primetime TV shows. `` At best, the status quo prevailed; at worst, backward steps were taken.'' Male-female relationships on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Major Dad'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup'' are `` straining viewer credibility,'' the group said `` Major Dad'' involves a crusty Marine and his forgiving young wife, while `` Chicken Soup'' stars comic <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> in a Catholic-Jewish matchup that `` resorts to flat stereotypes and unbelievable characters,'' the group said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Baywatch'' shows scantily clad female lifeguards or women sunning in bikinis or `` scampering on the beach,'' the group said. One episode of `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.,'' an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show about a 16-year-old doctor, has a `` brilliant -LRB- female -RRB- radiologist'' asking <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> to father her child. On <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Open House,'' a `` professional and competent'' female doctor, while conducting physicals for employees of a real estate firm, spots an old flame among the employees and `` begins to swoon and speaks to him in a seductive voice.'' The group said the shows are `` filled with stereotypes, double entendres and outdated characters.'' As for minorities, `` As in the past, most minority characters on new shows are black, and most of them appear in all, or mostly, black shows.'' Behind the scenes, 27 of the 145 producers on the 26 shows are women. Ten of the shows have no females behind the cameras, the group said. `` At best, the new season has given us the status quo. At worst, television has taken a step backward from the progress it made last year,'' actress <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday at the group's 11th annual Women at Work Broadcast Awards program. The only new shows that got good marks were `` Life Goes On'' and `` Alien Nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Life Goes On,'' starring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> as a teen-ager with Down's syndrome, was cited for its `` credible exploration of family issues.'' `` Alien Nation,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> show about aliens living on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, was praised for being `` in many ways an allegory about racism.'' The group bestowed its 1989 Commissioners Award on actress <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> for her portrayal of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Vietnam War drama, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.'' Other winning programs were: _ `` Horizons: the 9 to 5 Danger Zone _ Occupational Hazards''; `` Vocational Training Programs for Women in Prison''; and `` Repetitive Motion Syndrome _ Two Case Studies,'' from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. _ `` Vets'' episode of `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. _ `` Displaced Homemakers'' segment on `` ABC World News Tonight,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. _ `` Winning Women,'' <ORGANIZATION> WXIA-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. _ `` Women Under Fire,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. _ `` Nurses: Crisis in Care,'' <ORGANIZATION> KTVU </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ `` KOMO Editorial: Women's Pay,'' <ORGANIZATION> KOMO-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Wider Opportunities for Women, a national employment organization, merged in 1987 with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group for non-professionals.

 Two Washington-area real estate agents face charges of fraudulently obtaining $ 1.2 million in <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> loans and conspiring to sell more than $ 1 million in drugs to their real estate customers. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaikin </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, face a total of 190 years imprisonment and over $ 400,000 in fines for numerous charges including racketeering, wire fraud and obstruction of justice, said a statement by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested the men at their homes early Monday. The two, still dressed in their early morning jogging clothes, pleaded innocent before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, officials said. The judge released <PERSON> Chaikin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> on personal recognizance, despite a request from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> for a $ 250,000 bond on each. The indictments are part of an investigation of fraud in the sale of rental properties involving HUD-insured mortgages in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area that has seen 36 convictions so far. As described by an unidentified source `` close to the case'' quoted in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> would locate a property to purchase and <PERSON> Chaikin </PERSON> would find a straw buyer, or someone only pretending to be the buyer and getting a fee for the role. The two would bribe a government appraiser to assign a value to the property more than it was worth, and the straw buyer would apply for a loan, insured by a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> agency, using the inflated appraisal. <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> then paid the straw buyer a fee, the source told the newspaper. <PERSON> Chaikin </PERSON> would then pay the seller the actual market value, using the loan funds to do so and pocketing the leftover loan funds. The property was then resold at the inflated value and those profits were also pocketed, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 Displaying their best diplomatic manners, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are urging each other to make far-reaching changes in how they operate their economies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on the receiving end Monday of a long list of Japanese complaints, was taking the offensive today, the windup of a two-day round of new talks on lifestyle and other non-trade problems linked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials planned to urge the Japanese to take such steps as consuming more, building more sewers, ports and `` super-express'' highways, and making it easier to convert farmland into housing projects. This was in addition to better-known <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints about antiquated distribution, noncompetitive pricing and corporate collusion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends discriminates against imports and penalizes Japanese consumers. The American side was also stressing that it wants to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment market open to all countries but obstacles to investing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> make this increasingly difficult to defend. The Japanese led off with their grievances Monday because they accorded that courtesy to the Americans when the talks started two months ago in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and now they were the guests, said senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who briefed reporters Monday on condition of anonymity. Despite strong complaints and obvious disagreement, Monday's talk at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was `` constructive and open,'' one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said The new talks were announced by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last May as an effort to pinpoint non-trade causes contributing to the annual $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The two countries have agreed to meet every two months, with a final report in mid-1990. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday the ideal outcome would be emergence of `` some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that ... the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is much more competitive and so that on the Japanese side their economy is much more open.'' The Japanese charged Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate behavior weakened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and its competitiveness, both sides said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pointed to Wall Street's leveraged buyouts as an example of short-term business strategy hurting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. Japanese officials also criticized low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rates, low investment in production facilities, research and development, slowness to convert to metric measure and underemphasis on export promotion and education and training of workers, the Japanese source said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of wasteful use of energy and over-regulation by government in such areas as antitrust practices, the ban against selling Alaskan oil to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and required use of American-owned shipping, the source added. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was led by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for economic affairs, Deputy Trade Representative <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallara </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Farren </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Chinese Told To Make Sacrifices As Leaders Meet On Austerity Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist leaders met secretly today to endorse a three-year austerity plan and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people were told to brace for several years of `` hard living'' as the country grapples with economic difficulties. A commentary in the official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said `` only through a few years of hard work, belt-tightening, and unity can we go past this stage and continue the construction of our socialist modernization.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was expected tp prescribe tighter government controls over the economy and fewer market-oriented reforms. That could mean the revival of the primacy of central planning, restoration of the leadership of party members in factories and a limit in the growth of collective and private enterprise. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily commentary said people should realize that problems that have built up in past years `` can not possibly be resolved at once.'' It said the serious shortage of funds and raw materials afflicting the economy result in part from the recent `` turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' officialspeak for the crushed pro-democracy movement. The commentary complained that many local officials only pay lip service to the nation's austerity drive and `` at the decisive moment ... think of themselves and forget the interest of the country.'' It noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s impoverished multitudes live in a backward economy afflicted with a shortage of resources. In the early 1990s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will also enter a peak repayment period for its more than $ 40 billion in foreign debt. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> inaugurated its austerity program a year ago, severely restricting credit, canceling building projects and cutting government spending to slow excessive economic growth and reduce an inflation rate of more than 30 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, citing reports of fraudulent Soviet exit permits, has restricted access to a European route used by tens of thousands of Soviet Jews to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A pattern of fraud emerged last month, apparently involving some individuals in the Soviet agency that issues the permits, officials said Monday. Permits had to be dated before Oct. 1 for Soviet Jews to obtain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and the applicants had to also have Israeli visas. Otherwise, prospective emigrants are processed through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The new restriction required emigrants to obtain their Israeli visas by Monday. As a result, Soviet Jews may remain at home rather than waiting in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> until their entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is approved. Jews who leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after Monday on Israeli visas will be presumed to have chosen to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is being urged to repeal part of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that a report says causes widespread discrimination against Hispanics. A report issued Monday, the third anniversary of the law, said the section of the law providing for fines against employers causes discrimination. The law granted legal immigration to workers who had been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1982. It also set out guidelines for hiring and provided sanctions for employers who failed to verify that all newly employed workers had proper documentation. The report was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 A year after his failed presidential bid, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the legacy of his campaign may have been to teach a potent lesson to fellow Democrats: attack. `` You had better be ready to attack,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You may not like it, and the public may not like it, but the alternative is to watch yourself be trashed and be defeated.'' Where Democrats face tough election battles, particularly in today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> gubernatorial and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mayoral contests, the governor said those candidates have been aware of the danger in ignoring attacks `` If there's one contribution I've made to the three races, it's at least to give the three Democrats a sense of what not to do, what the danger is,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday `` And I think the three of them were very much aware of that from the beginning, having been forewarned by what happened in the presidential race.''

 A needle exchange program intended to protect drug addicts from AIDS _ once planned as the first in the nation _ has begun after nearly 1 -LCB- years of delays caused by problems getting insurance. Outside-In, a nonprofit agency, started giving addicts clean hypodermic needles in exchange for their dirty ones Nov. 1, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, the agency's administrator. The 400 addicts expected to use the service also will be offered bleach to sterilize their own needles, drug-purifying cookers and condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, Ms. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. The virus is transmitted through blood and semen. The program was to begin in June 1988 but was delayed until the agency found liability insurance it could afford, Ms. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. Since then, other cities have started needle exchanges. The agency delayed announcement of the program's start to shield addicts from the news media, she said.

The prime minister's office oversees the nation's administrative machinery. <PERSON> Fikre </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassi </PERSON> was one of a clique of officers who staged the 1974 coup that overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and led to <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s assumption of power. He had served as prime minister since the formation of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Shengo </LOCATION>, in 1987, and before that was one of three senior ministers in <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s government. Observers said he and <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> differed over economic policy with <PERSON> Fikre </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> reportedly supporting greater liberalization of the private sector. <PERSON> Hailu </PERSON>, his possible successor, is about 50 years old and has served as a deputy prime minister since 1987. He also has run several ministries including industry and mines and energy.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Inspections of Some Newer 737s, Older 747s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered inspections of newer <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s for possible missing bolts in a doorframe and of older 747s for possible cracks. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said both problems could lead to rapid decompression of the planes. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered the inspections in separate directives issued late last week. In the case of the 737s, it ordered operators to fly the planes at lower than normal altitudes and lower cabin pressurizations until they could be inspected. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said some bolts may be missing from the forward passenger doorstop in model 300 and model 400 737s. The 737 directive, issued Friday, affects 18 of the last 20 737-300s and -400 s built, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> So far, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said, no planes have been found to have missing bolts. The inspections must be performed within 20 flights of receipt of the directive and the problem fixed as soon as detected. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s are twin-engine jetliners, with the model 300 carrying 141 passengers and the model 400 156 passengers. Gamble said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, plant, which assembles fuselage sections of 737s, discovered when looking at paperwork for the planes that it was possible one of the two bolts could have been omitted. He said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> notified the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> of that possibility on Thursday. `` It's one of those precautionary things you want to do,'' he said. Six of the planes were delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers and no bolts were missing on those planes, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. Twelve went to either foreign airlines or leasing companies, and not all have reported in. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union is on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> and other plants, but <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said all the construction work on the affected airplanes had been completed before the strike began Oct. 4. `` There's no reason to believe the strike had anything to do with it,'' he said. The 747 order was prompted by an operator finding small skin cracks in the general area ahead and above the forward passenger door on a plane with 18,455 landings, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoan <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has ordered visual and electronic inspections for the cracks on all 747s with 15,500 landings or more that have not had special modifications. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> making the inspections mandatory Thursday. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> said the order affects as many as 92 older 747s. She said cracks have been found in some of those jets, but she did not have any numbers Monday night.

<HEAD>Dissident Lieutenant Forms Union For Police and Prison Officers</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SAHM VENTER</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The police lieutenant who publicly accused riot squad members of brutality has expanded his crusade against the security establishment by forming a union for police and prison guards. Although Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>'s superiors have ordered him not to speak to the press, <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> invited journalists to a meeting Monday night at which the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was launched. Government regulations prohibit security force members from belonging to unions. Police officials have confirmed that <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> is the subject of a departmental inquiry and could face disciplinary action for violating orders. In addition to making unauthorized public statements, he has acknowledged refusing to accept an order to report for border duty, far from his home town of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain, near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` I will be very prominent for the next 10 years,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said Monday night. `` If they want me out of the police department, they should kick me out.'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said seven policemen and 21 prison employees already had joined the new union, formed after he was approached by disgruntled guards. Like <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, the other members are mixed-race, although he said the union was open to whites and blacks. He said the members had previously raised complaints about working conditions through normal channels and were dissatisfied with the response. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> came to prominence in September when he accused members of an all-white police riot squad of behaving like `` wild dogs'' when they dispersed and beat protesters and bystanders in <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain during a demonstration against the exclusion of blacks from national elections. Two white officers were charged with assault in connection with the incident. They were acquitted last month, but the judge criticized the behavior of some of the officers in the riot squad. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said the new union would seek to ensure that security officers were not exposed to racial discrimination and were able to speak freely. Some prison gaurds had complained that they were housed in unused cells, he said. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> also said the union would campaign against maltreatment of prisoners. He said some children as young as 10 sometimes are kept in prison for months while awaiting trial for crimes such as housebreaking. Since entering the media spotlight, <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> has written a book, `` Rockman: One Man's Crusade Against Apartheid Police,'' which is to be published at the end of the month.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with delayed gold fixing</HEAD>

 The dollar eased in early European trading today on a lack of financial news, reported intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and Monday's drop on Wall Street, currency dealers said. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Dealers said there continues to be little market-affecting news, other than Monday's 47.34-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. `` The market is essentially stable,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` There are no signs of a resumption of any movement'' in the main currencies, he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.18 yen to a closing 143.63 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.45 yen. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly sold dollars for yen during the East Asian day when the dollar approached the psychologically important 144.00-yen barrier. Traders said the move limited the dollar's upward potential, but did not raise fears of another round of concerted central bank intervention. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday: _ 1.8460 West German marks, down from 1.8517 _ 1.6205 Swiss francs, down from 1.6240 _ 6.2610 French francs, down from 6.2805 _ 2.0837 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910 _ 1,350.40 Italian lire, down from 1,357.25 _ 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar It cost $ 1.5813 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.5795 late Monday.

<HEAD>Witnesses: Confusion over Navigation, Lights Led to Grounding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Confusion over navigation equipment and warning lights led to the grounding of a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> freighter on a fragile coral reef, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inquiry. Also Monday, the federal government filed a civil lawsuit seeking $ 9 million in damages for destruction of the 500-foot swath of reef in the Dry Tortugas, about 65 miles west of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The suit blames the grounding on the ship's `` unseaworthiness and the negligence of those in charge.'' The damage amount represents the value of the seized ship and cargo, as well as the reef damage, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said. The ship's captain testified at the opening of the hearing Monday that his second officer, who was in charge at the time of the grounding Oct. 30, became confused while making a minor course change. The move sent the phosphate hauler west into a charted shoal instead of east into <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Channel </PERSON> between the Dry Tortugas and Key West, ship's captain <PERSON> Zdravko </PERSON> <PERSON> Beran </PERSON> testified. A depth finder on board was turned off at the time. `` I think that he was confused. I think that he must go port, and he went starboard,'' the captain, a merchant seaman for 30 years, said in broken English. `` He told me that he did wrong _ big error.'' The freighter, carrying 14,300 tons of phosphate and 143,000 gallons of fuel, was refloated without damage Thursday and impounded by the government. Marine Patrol officer <PERSON> Gorden </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> testified that Second Officer <PERSON> Zvonko </PERSON> <PERSON> Baric </PERSON> told him he had mistaken a warning light for a channel light and had hit the reef at 12 knots without slowing down. <PERSON> Beran </PERSON> also said he was using one large chart covering an area from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> because a strike had held up delivery of more detailed charts.

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Child-abuse charges against the mother of a baby born addicted to cocaine have been dismissed by a judge who ruled the fetus is not a child. The judge threw out the charges Monday against 23-year-old <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Gethers </PERSON>, who was arrested in February after she and her daughter were found to be addicted. She had given birth to a cocaine-addicted son a year before her daughter was born and received counseling at the time on the dangers of using the drug while pregnant. In dismissing the charges, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> cited an appeals court ruling in the case of a man who was charged with battery against an infant after he shot a woman in the abdomen and she gave birth to a wounded baby. The court ruled the fetus was not a person. `` That issue has been decided,'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney, said he will appeal. Ms. <PERSON> Gethers </PERSON> remains in jail, serving an 18-month sentence for violating probation on a conviction for possession of cocaine. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>'s ruling means the state can not `` legislate morality prior to birth,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gethers </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Approaches Needed to Calm Fears Over Japanese Investment, Expert

<TEXT>
 Japanese investors should adopt new, cooperative alliances with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to ease fears they are `` buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and help revitalize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessman said today. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of commerce and the chairman of The <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, called on Japanese investors to participate in a `` global, private-sector <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan'' to help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector. The Marshall Plan was the financial aid program drafted in 1947 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> to help rebuild war-ravaged <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> desperately needs investment and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has immense capital. The question is, how can it be done so that it's both economically and politically productive? <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He defended Japanese direct investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION>'s recent purchase of a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.4 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, which The <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> helped put together. Given huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and federal deficits and the need to service the almost $ 1 trillion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt, `` we need a voracious amount of foreign financing,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said, arguing against curbs on further investments. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should do more to ease American fears about the so-called `` buying up of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by going all out to open its own markets to foreign investment and trade and by avoiding excessive concentration of acquisitions in such areas as <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` The fears of Americans are real,'' he said. `` In every Japanese acquisition of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> skyscraper or a <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> hotel, some see an inevitable pattern of Japanese ascendancy and American decline,'' he said. Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms should form joint ventures and minority investment arrangements that enable both sides to exchange technology, market access and distribution facilities, while avoiding the political problems and managerial pitfalls of speculative acquisitions, he said. Japanese companies and the government could do more to help ease trade frictions, he said. `` If the Japanese companies are not more creative and flexible in permitting foreign companies to participate directly in this market, ... I think it will have a serious backlash effect,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, saloonkeeper <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> on television's `` Gunsmoke,'' died of AIDS-related complications, not cancer as a hospital and friends had reported, her doctor says. Dr. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> internist, said Monday that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who died at age 60 on Aug. 16, had throat cancer. But he added, `` That was n't the reason that she died.'' Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, a longtime resident of the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area, had AIDS symptoms for about a year, <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know how she contracted the disease. Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s fifth husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, a developer and city councilman in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, died of pneumonia in 1985 at age 45. They married in April 1984, and divorced a short time later. <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON> was interviewed following a report on <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> TV station <ORGANIZATION> KRBK </ORGANIZATION> that quoted friends of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> as saying her death was AIDS-related. After Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> died at Mercy General Hospital, a statement by the hospital and her friends reported the cause of death as cancer. Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s death certificate, however, listed the immediate cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest due to liver failure and CMV hepatitis. CMV, or cytomegalo virus, hepatitis is AIDS-related, said <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON>, who treated Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> in her last year and signed her death certificate. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer were listed on the certificate as contributing causes of death. AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. Once a two-pack-a-day smoker, Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> underwent surgery for oral cancer in 1977 and afterward made appearances on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON>, a Mercy General spokeswoman, said she previously reported cancer as the cause of death at the request of Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s close friends. `` When somebody dies, you go by what the wishes of the family are. In this case, the friends were the family,'' <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> said. `` They have the right to say whatever they want to say.'' <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> said she never saw the death certificate. She said the hospital reported the death to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors AIDS and other contagious diseases. Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> reigned as Miss Kitty, queen of <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saloon </LOCATION>, for 19 years in `` Gunsmoke.'' Set in the lawless cattle town of <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, in the late 1800s, `` Gunsmoke'' was one of television's original `` adult westerns'' in the mid-1950s. Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> left `` Gunsmoke'' in 1974. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> canceled the show one season later. After `` Gunsmoke,'' Miss <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> worked only sporadically, usually in guest appearances for TV game shows, movies of the week and such series as `` Edge of Night,'' `` <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>,'' and `` Love Boat.'' She also was a longtime activist for animal protection.

 Thai fishermen have rescued three dozen people caught in a typhoon that ravaged the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the mainland four days ago and have discovered more bodies, the navy said today. It was unclear whether any of the dead or rescued were from a U.S.-owned drilling ship that capsized Saturday with 97 crewmen aboard after being caught in the typhoon. Six crewmen have been rescued and seven bodies found. According to press reports, some 400 Thai fishermen were missing. The navy report said at least 63 fishing boats sank in the storm and another nine were missing. The government death toll on land was 31, but one local official put the number at more than 70. A navy ship found 17 bodies in the sea since beginning a search in the gulf east of <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION> late Monday, navy spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Suravut </PERSON> <PERSON> Maharom </PERSON> said. Another 30 were found on an island in <LOCATION> Chumphon </LOCATION> province. In addition, fisherman rescued 35 more people caught in Typhoon Gay, the navy said. It did not give details. The search for 84 crewmen missing from the 5,373-ton <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> continued today. The <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> capsized Saturday in the gulf during the worst storm to hit <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in three decades. `` All I remember is the sound of swirling wind. The darkness, the rain, the waves. And every now and then, the screams for help,'' <PERSON> Chalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Duangpakdee </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> survivor, said in an interview published by the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Bangkok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today. The Thai kitchen worker said the ship was buffeted by huge waves and an alarm went off to abandon ship. He grabbed a life jacket, jumped into the sea with many other crew members and managed to secure himself with rope inside a life raft. A foreign crew member who also climbed into the lifeboat but had not tied himself down was swept away. After several hours, <PERSON> Chalit </PERSON> was picked up by a Thai fishing boat, he told the newspaper. The ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>, today identified two more of the dead: <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Seliger </PERSON>, the ship's West German captain, and <PERSON> Delvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Irby </PERSON>, an American tool pusher from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Eyewitnesses reportedly told <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> that nearly all crew had abandoned the ship after the alarm and signal to do so had been given. But the captain and three others remained in the ship's wheelhouse, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> said in a press release A team of investigators from Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> is investigating why the ship failed to withstand the high winds and seas and whether it was given adequate warning of the typhoon's approach The search for survivors was being carried out by the company and the <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, which has used divers to check the submerged vessel. The crew was mostly Thai, but seven were Americans. None of the known survivors are American. The <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> capsized in the gulf's <LOCATION> Platong </LOCATION> field, one of several being exploited for natural gas by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>. It is 270 miles south of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has cleared the way for logging next year in some of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest forests _ prime nesting spots for the rare spotted owl. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> on Monday ruled that an agreement reached by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that allows cutting of some of the giant trees is constitutional, according to <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The order turned back a challenge by environmentalists and vacated an injunction against timber cutting on federal land in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and a Nov. 13 trial of the environmentalists' lawsuit `` I would hope we could start fairly quickly'' to auction timber in 13 national forests affected by the lawsuit, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Butruille </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s regional forester for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' compromise also requires the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to start protecting old growth trees, which are at least 200 years old. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> gave no explanation in his ruling, which upheld a section of an appropriations bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month. The judge said an opinion will follow, according to Sher. `` What took him so long?'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughtery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The disputed trees `` probably should have been hewed down over 100 years ago ... they're just taking up good growing room in the forests,'' <PERSON> Daughtery </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, we're really pleased,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` We're glad to see the court say we can continue.'' Plainiffs contended <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted unconstitutionally in creating the one-year compromise crafted to satisfy the timber industry and the advocates for the owl, which nests primarily in the old growth forests of the Northwest. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to list the owl on the endangered species list. `` It's a disappointing ruling for us,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. `` But our quarrel is not with Judge <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> or the federal court, it's with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which has put federal agencies above the law and stripped the courts of their ability to enforce the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, representing The <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other environmental groups, had asked <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> to proceed with a trial. The lawsuit contended that logging on federal land in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> in spotted owl habitat would violate federal environmental laws. In March, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> blocked timber sales in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in owl-sensitive areas. The blocked sales total more than 1 billion board feet. Last May, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> signed an order putting the lawsuit on hold. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> then stepped in. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the plaintiffs have n't decided whether to appeal Monday's decision. `` It's hard to say what the next step will be until we see the judge's reasoning, and we see how the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proceeds with implementing the new legislation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Convicted Drug Dealer Says He Gave DC Mayor Crack Cocaine</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 11th graf, Lewis' statement, to CORRECT charges to two
counts of conspiracy, rather than two counts of possession and distribution.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted drug dealer's sworn testimony that he gave crack cocaine to Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> several times is reviving questions about whether the mayor uses drugs. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 49, testified under oath in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that he gave <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> cocaine at least three times while <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' room at a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel late last year. Despite many press accounts of investigations against the mayor, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' statement was the first on-the-record, under-oath accusation that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the city's mayor since 1979, had been given drugs. `` I'm not worried at all about this,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who has repeatedly denied ever using drugs, told reporters Monday. He described <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as a `` convicted felon'' and added, `` He'll say anything in court ... trying to save his own hide.'' The federal investigation began in December when city police called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on discovering that the mayor was in <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who has described <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as an old friend, acknowledged making at least six visits to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel during that period. But the mayor has steadfastly denied using, seeing or purchasing drugs during those trips. The mayor's attorney, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundy </PERSON>, scoffed at the defendant's comments `` We question the credibility of the source,'' <PERSON> Mundy </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> is a besieged and beleaguered man who knows that his only salvation comes by not giving truthful statements about the mayor.'' Rumors about <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s alleged use of drugs have persisted for years. In 1984, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a convicted drug dealer, went to prison on contempt of court charges after refusing to tell federal prosecutors whether she used cocaine with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> or sold drugs to him and other top city officials. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is married, admitted to having had an unspecified `` personal relationship'' with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, but denied ever using drugs with her. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' statement came as Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> was reviewing a plea bargain calling for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> to plead guilty to two counts of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine. The second count centered on <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' activities at the hotel last December, and made reference to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> distributing cocaine to one individual on at least three separate occasions. `` Because I do n't want to look like a fool, was one of the individuals you gave cocaine to the mayor of this city?'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. As the defendant was preparing to answer, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Retchin </PERSON> asked to discuss the matter privately with the judge. During the bench conference, <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> was overheard to say, `` I do n't think it fair that we read all this in the newspaper,'' apparently in reference to press leaks about the case. `` He's under oath and should answer.'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> then overruled the prosecutor's objections to the question and ordered <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> to answer. After hearing the query repeated by the court stenographer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, your honor, crack cocaine.'' When <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> that he was under oath and asked him whether he was telling the truth, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> replied, `` No question about it, sir.'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> then accepted the plea agreement and the two guilty pleas under it. Sentencing was set for Jan. 8. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine for each count. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had originally faced a 14-count indictment that included perjury charges and additional counts of cocaine distribution and possession, but prosecutors dropped 12 of those counts. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> earlier this year. His sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely Monday as part of the plea bargain. After the court proceeding, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soschin </PERSON> predicted that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> will serve between 10 and 12 months in jail, the minimum called for under the rules governing the plea bargain. As part of the agreement, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> is bound to cooperate with prosecutors in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> drug investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> refused to comment on the case, or whether <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is now a target of the investigation. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has testified twice before the grand jury hearing evidence on the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government official, had been a consultant to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government. He said he was staying in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel while looking for work.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today it has postponed $ 40 billion in borrowing auctions this week because of congressional failure to raise the debt limit. `` The postponement of these auctions is necessary because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory debt limit ...,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Police today arrested about 20 Tibetan women who demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to demand independence for their homeland from Chinese rule. Officers outside the embassy struggled briefly with the women as they tried to get into the building. `` We want independence!'' the protesters shouted.

Tibetan refugees in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> regularly hold rallies outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and present memorandums demanding freedom for their homeland.

 <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> <PERSON> Plymale </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> went to her grave not knowing that one son was dead and the other in jail, charged with killing his brother in a fight over how the cancer-stricken woman should spend her final days. `` I do n't know of anyone being cruel enough to tell her,'' her brother, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Plymale </PERSON>, said after Monday's funeral. Mrs. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was buried Monday, the day her son <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> appeared at a bail hearing in the Oct. 25 shotgun slaying. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, 51, was slain in an argument with his brother in the laundry room over the care of their 86-year-old mother, who died Friday and had lapsed in and out of consciousness for days, police said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, 53, did not attend the funeral but was allowed a few moments alone with her body before he was taken in shackles to a courtroom, where he told Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> he helped make his mother's last days comfortable. `` Mother paid all the bills and I took care of the house,'' he said. <PERSON> Plymale </PERSON> told a reporter that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, who lived with his mother, was insensitive to her and the family. `` He was a liar ... and a smoker and a drunkard,'' <PERSON> Plymale </PERSON> said. `` He used to brag that he'd sit on the back porch and shoot squirrels and eat them.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was shot as he prepared to pack his bags to return home to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 At least 5,000 people today spurned official Red Square ceremonies to commemorate the Bolshevik Revolution and marched through <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to protest food shortages, pollution, Communist rule and the secret police. In <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, activists said police beat protesters who forced cancellation of the military part of the republic's parade. Striking miners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> joined a celebration with slogans urging the government to allow greater independence and improve living and working conditions. The unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital as President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Soviet leadership stood atop the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mausoleum </ORGANIZATION> and reviewed the traditional display of military hardware. The official tolerance of a counter-demonstration on the hallowed national holiday showed how far the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has come from the authoritarian rule of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s predecessors. So did the toned-down nature of the Red Square celebrations marking the 72nd anniversary of the revolution that brought the Communists to power in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Not as much emphasis was placed on military might as in previous years. `` We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing having changed for the better, and this is our protest,'' said marcher <PERSON> Taisya </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlyonova </PERSON>, a pensioner. The demonstrators represented a broad spectrum of unofficial groups. `` We do n't want the people to be sheep that can be led as they have been led for 72 years,'' popular prosecutor <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> said. `` Power must be taken away from the apparatus and given to the people.'' Leaders of the independent event steered their marchers away from Red Square and a possible confrontation with authorities or with the thousands of marchers at the official ceremonies. Responding to posters plastered around the city on the eve of Revolution Day, activists assembled near the <ORGANIZATION> Dynamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> station two hours before the start of official ceremonies. Their route took them to a fork with one street leading toward Red Square, and some demonstrators initially headed that way. However, leaders made appeals from a sound truck and steered them instead to a route sanctioned by city officials. Organizers said they had been told by authorities they would not be permitted to march through the square because they could not guarantee the march would remain orderly. The marchers, many walking arm in arm, chanted slogans in support of maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other reformist members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and shouted `` Down with the KGB'' secret police. Some brandished posters scorning the 1917 Communist revolution glorified at the official ceremonies. `` Seventy-two years on the road to nowhere,'' said one poster. Others proclaimed, `` Down With <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the hard-line Communist on the ruling Politburo who has come to symbolize resistance to economic and social reform. The marchers represented a wide spectrum of interests, from environmental groups protesting construction of a nuclear power station to church groups demanding freedom of worship in the officially atheist Communist state. Last year, such unofficial groups marched in some Soviet cities on Revolution Day, but this was the first time they took to the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the holiday. In the southern republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, police beat people in a crowd of thousands that gathered near a monument to national hero <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Moldavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organization said in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the republic's capital. More were beaten when police dispersed a crowd of a couple hundred People's Front supporters on <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION> a couple of hours later, he said. Officials canceled the military part of the parade. Thousands of People's Front supporters marched the parade route with slogans condemning the police and the republic's leadership, <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said. In Red Square, the traditional parade of tanks, troops, and banner-waving marchers selected by their workplaces passed through on schedule. It was broadcast on state-run television, which made no reference to the unofficial march. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, acknowledging the country's troubles in an informal television interview during the ceremonies, said abandonment of the old system of central control without installing a new system has resulted in `` a loss or weakening of control.'' But to go back would be `` the greatest mistake,'' he said, calling instead for faster movement toward a new economic order. He gave few details, but progressives have recently criticized the regime for half-measures that they say only make matters worse. Longtime observers said the official ceremonies this year were considerably toned down from previous years, when the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership used the parade to show off the Soviets' military might. Few missiles were in evidence today. Anti-tank guided missile systems and surface-to-air missile resupply vehicles were dropped this year, diplomats said. They had said they expected just one new weapon, an updated version of the T-72 tank, to join the parade. In addition, party slogans were far less militant than just a few years ago. In another expression of discontent, a local chapter of the nationalist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> movement in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, capital of the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, declared the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>' seizure of power was not a revolution but `` a government coup.'' The group said the takeover `` cut short the process of democratization that started after the February 1917 revolution -LRB- that overthrew the czar -RRB-.'' Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> abdicated to a provisional government that was overthrown eight months later by the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>.

 An explosion during an artillery test killed two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and injured two others at the <ORGANIZATION> Yuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground, authorities said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> team was conducting firing tests of an Israeli-modified M-109 howitzer at the desert facility when the accident occurred, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said late Monday. `` The actual projectile or bomb did not explode,'' he said. `` It was the propelling charge that went off.

 A bomb planted by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> exploded today outside the home of a senior police official, but the man and his family narrowly escaped injury. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, had returned from his mother's funeral in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> hours before the bomb blew up below the living room window of his home in <LOCATION> Drumbo </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON> had just left the living room when the blast ripped through the bulletproof window behind an armchair where he had been reading. His wife was in another room. <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>'s 7-month-old daughter <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> was asleep in a cot in the living room and was showered with debris, a police spokesman said. His 18-month-old daughter <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> was asleep in an adjoining bedroom. `` Both infants were only six to eight feet from the bomb when it went off,'' the spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` They had a miraculous escape.'' He said the bomb caused extensive damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility and, in a statement to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news media, said it had been watching <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>'s movements for some time The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the bomb contained three pounds of explosives. `` We deliberately placed a small charge only, because we were aware of the young children in the house,'' it said. `` Otherwise we could undoubtedly have guaranteed <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>'s death with a larger charge.'' The English-born <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, 49, is in charge of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's complaints and discipline branch. He is scheduled to take over as deputy chief constable of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> later this month. Eight Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, including one chief superintendent and two superintendents, have been murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underwent tests today at a hospital, where she was taken by ambulance after complaining of sluggishness, a spokeswoman said. The wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had suffered from the flu for three or four days before she was taken Monday night to <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hospitalization came almost exactly a year after her husband's White House defeat. `` I do n't know if it's flu-related. I know she was feeling groggy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said. `` She's been feeling tired. Last night she was feeling particularly lethargic.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underwent four weeks of treatment for alcoholism at a clinic after her husband's unsuccessful campaign. She revealed previously she was addicted to diet pills for years. She underwent neck surgery last year. Ms. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said initial examinations did not indicate her illness was drug - or alcohol-related Ms. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> would not say what the tests were or whether Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been given a CAT scan as WNEV-TV reported today. Hospital officials refused to provide any information on Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who will be 53 on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was with her when she arrived at the hospital, stayed a few hours Monday night and returned this morning. He did not immediately talk to reporters.

 A check of old case files led straight to a bathtub in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where authorities arrested a man in the slaying of a woman 29 years ago. `` You do n't clear one this old too often,'' said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's investigator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, who helped break the case. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and investigator <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON> last week came across a murder warrant for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> in the shooting of his former girlfriend, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1960. As the detectives do routinely, they asked for an information sheet on <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which categorizes every person arrested by fingerprints and not by name. When the detectives received the file on <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, it included a 1985 arrest of a man named <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on an assault charge in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police furnished a phone number for the man. `` We called and said we were doing a survey,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I talked to his wife.

Relatives later said he had died, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> closed the case in 1980, sheriff's detectives said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> teen-agers today beat up vendors who ignored a strike that was called to show solidarity with the army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in his opposition to the new president, witnesses said. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was elected president Sunday, consulted with politicians in Syrian-controlled north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in an effort to form a government. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who headed a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> for 14 months prior to <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election, remained in the shell-ravaged presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, refusing to relinquish it to <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>. He termed the presidential election `` unconstitutional.'' About 500 youths chanting `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is the legitimate leader!'' gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>. They waved portraits of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> flags and slogans calling on <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to `` protect <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has been the Christians' main protector here. It ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until independence in 1943. About 40 of the demonstrators began a sit-in outside the compound. They raised a banner that said: `` <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> has disappointed us.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and other major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and international governments have backed <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and a 32-year veteran of Lebanese politics. He was voted into office by Lebanese legislators who also approved a peace accord giving the Moslem majority more power in decision making. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposed the accord because it did not set a deadline for withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His main problem with <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> is the president's close links with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> wants them out because they are the Moslems' main supporters. A committee of Christian youths who support <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> called a general strike for a fourth day in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian heartland to the north, which is controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops. Only bakeries were allowed to open, and thousands of people lined up outside. Some vendors in the east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> defied the strike call and opened their stands. Young demonstrators attacked them with sticks, witnesses reported. `` We want peace. We want to work to make money. We live hand-to-mouth,'' a vendor shouted as teen-agers beat him up, one witness reported. He said some demonstrators were `` kids around the age of 12.'' The others were slightly older. `` The vegetable vendors and the kids fought with fists and sticks. Policemen at a nearby police station did not interfere. In fact, they did n't dare interfere because they know the demonstrators are backed by the army,'' another witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said hundreds of demonstrators drove by in cars decorated with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s pictures and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> flags `` shouting orders to abide by the strike.'' A car mechanic said: `` We want an end to war. We've had enough. `` What more does the general want? does he want to get the Maronites -LRB- Catholics -RRB- slaughtered?'' he said. He identified himself only as Fares, and added: `` You publish my name and the general's intelligence men will pick me up in 10 minutes. `` They did n't spare the patriarch,'' he said, referring to the attack early Monday on Maronite Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, the highest Christian religious authority in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Pro-Aoun demonstrators ransacked his compound in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, shouted insults at the patriarch and forced him to kneel on the floor and kiss a poster of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> supported Mouawad. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> has been at his home in the mountain resort of <LOCATION> Zghorta </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where dozens of parliamentrians, former prime ministers and senior politicians visited him for consultations. In west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, an old stone villa was being prepared for Mouawad. The <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> palace is a wreck. It was destroyed in six months of ferocious fighting between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian troops. The fighting was halted by a cesae-fire in September.

 Israeli aircraft rocketed bases of the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this morning. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Reporters in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> said at least two helicopter gunships were involved in the attack. Smoke billowed from the stricken targets as ground defenders fired at the Israeli aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. No hits were observed. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army communique said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> targets were struck in <LOCATION> Mazraat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ayn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Busiwar </LOCATION>, 14 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. `` All targets were hit and our planes returned safely to base,'' the communique said. It did say what type aircraft were involved in the raid and did not mention casualties or damage. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters would not allow police into the area and that it was not known if anyone was killed or injured. `` We'll only know if they evacuate any wounded to hospitals in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. An Israeli army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said several targets were struck. He refused to elaborate.

 More than 60 nations today urged the world to stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases blamed for the `` greenhouse effect,'' over opposition from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Most of the participants at the 68-nation conference on global warming adopted a declaration saying that carbon dioxide emissions should be stabilized within 10 years as a first step toward fighting the pollution problem. Environmentalists were bitter about the refusal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to sign the declaration. `` The conference is a total failure, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have sabotaged it,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based environmentalist group. The Dutch, hosts of the two-day ministerial meeting, had hoped to align all the participating nations unanimously behind a commitment to stabilize emissions by the end of the century and to begin reducing them in 2005. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, chief administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> protection agency, said the `` distinction was between those countries that want to commit themselves to stabilization by the year 2000 and those, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who are not prepared to say so at this time.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said, `` We believe in a reduction of carbon dioxide. But we're not prepared to say by what time and by what level.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the countries should wait for completion of studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, a forum trying to find ways of reducing global warming. The level at which the emissions were to be stabilized will be set next year by the U.N.-sponsored climate change panel, which is planning a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in February, and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> scheduled for late 1990, according to the nations' declaration Earlier, Japanese delegates said they were awaiting more scientific data on climate change and on the economic effects of drastic measures to curb the greenhouse effect, which is believed by some scientists to be the cause of a slight warming of the earth's atmosphere. Some scientists fear the phenomenon could eventually lead to the flooding of coastal areas and expansion of deserts. Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. In 1988, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounted for nearly 24 percent of total world emissions of the gas, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Much carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fuels such as coal and gasoline. The final declaration also called for ways to provide money to Third World nations to help them cope with the consequences of climatic change. Participating nations also said that by the end of the century, an annual 30-million acre reforestation program should be under way in the tropics. The destruction of rain forest is believed to contribute to the greenhouse effect.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Ease Technical Requirements on Environmental Suits</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to ease the technical requirements facing people who sue to protect the environment. The justices ruled 7-2 against an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> farming couple, saying the victory it took <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> three years and $ 95,000 to win against their county never should have been ruled on by a federal court. But the Hallstroms are free to start all over again, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote for the court. The Hallstroms' trial victory was overturned by a federal appeals court because their lawyer had failed to notify federal and state environmental officials, as required by the law they sued under, before filing the 1982 suit. The suit contended that a <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, landfill adjacent to what is left of the Hallstroms' 200-acre dairy farm caused or contributed to the pollution of their water supply. Despite the failure to notify government officials 60 days before the suit was filed, a federal judge allowed the suit to proceed _ and in 1985 ordered the county to remedy violations of federal environmental law within two years. The judge turned down the Hallstroms' request for $ 95,000 in lawyer fees, and the couple appealed. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 ruled that the Hallstroms' suit should have been dismissed before any trial because of the failure to notify. That ruling was upheld today. `` Where a party suing under the citizen suit provisions of the -LRB- Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 -RRB- fails to meet the notice and 60-day delay requirement, the district court must dismiss the action as barred by the terms of the statute,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote. She added that the Hallstroms are not being deprived `` of their right to a day in court'' because they `` remain free to give notice and file their suit in compliance with the statute to enforce pertinent environmental standards.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> dissented, stating in an opinion by <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> that the decision `` ill serves both judicial economy and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' purposes'' in passing the environmental protection law. The Hallstroms' lawyer, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, informed the county of their intention to sue well before the 60-day period required by the federal law. But <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> did not give the same required notification to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. In arguments before the justices last month, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> urged the court to `` look at the spirit'' of the law, contending that `` it's just not fair'' to make the Hallstroms `` jump through a judicial hoop that has no purpose. But in her opinion today, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the notification requirement was intended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give agencies `` a 60-day nonadversarial period to achieve compliance'' with the environmental law. The case is <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 88-42.

<HEAD>Army Surgeons Training at Ghetto Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army is training young surgeons to handle war carnage by sending them to the emergency room at a ghetto hospital inundated with victims of gang violence. Two Army residents recently completed two months' training at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr.-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the city's Watts section. County supervisors were to vote today on allowing four more surgeons to train there next year. `` At King, we see the kind of penetrating trauma that we just do n't see at other hospitals,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON>, chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's a place where the residents will have to treat a large volume of high-velocity wounds, the kind we would see in war.'' Army doctors used to receive their trauma surgery training at public hospitals near their home bases. But the young surgeons rarely see the kinds of gaping, multiple wounds caused by automatic and semiautomatic gunfire common to gang violence here, where more than 353 gang-related slayings were reported last year. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, a fourth-year resident at the Army hospital in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, completed his two-month stint in trauma surgery at <LOCATION> King-Drew </LOCATION> last week. The hospital is at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION>. `` It makes sense that since we're military surgeons, we'll treat the kinds of wounds that we would see in combat,'' he said. `` And that's definitely what I saw there.'' The 430-bed, county-run teaching hospital treated almost 3,500 trauma victims in 1988, or nearly 40 percent of the county's trauma patients. Health officials estimate that doctors there treat more than 100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month. Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, chief of trauma and surgery at <LOCATION> King-Drew </LOCATION>, proposed the facility as an Army training site to boost manpower at the overburdened trauma unit. Army officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of their surgical training.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he hoped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to return $ 567 million in frozen assets to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will help get `` underbrush cleaned out'' and lead to the eventual release of hostages. `` I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference at the White House a day before the first anniversary of his election. He said he knew of no reason to be encouraged at this time, however. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convened reporters on the anniversary of his election victory and he used an introductory statement to sum up with satisfaction his first 10 months in office. `` I enjoy it; I like the challenge,'' he said. One of the first questions was based on statements by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had reacted to cautiously to changes in the Communist world. His questioner pointed out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he would go to next month's meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with no initiatives to offer. `` I'd like to hear some specific suggestions,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` besides triple the spending.'' He said he has no perception that <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies are unhappy with the pace of his U.S.-Soviet policies. MORE

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has gone to court to get Camp Hill prison officials to remove the shackles and handcuffs used to bind some 1,000 inmates in pairs since a riot last month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON> set a hearing for today in a suit filed by the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of four inmates. The suit also claims inmates have not had adequate clothing, heat, plumbing, food or medical treatment since the uprising was put down Oct. 27. The rioting left 123 people injured and half the prison in flames. The continued restraint of the inmates is `` designed solely to inflict cruel and unusual punishment,'' said the suit, filed Monday. `` I think it's torture. We do not treat animals this way,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> legal director <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. A Corrections Department spokeswoman said about 1,200 inmates remain restrained and in locked cells. Another spokesman, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said the staff is trying to identify inmates who were not directly involved in the rioting. Those inmates will be moved to other blocks where prisoners are not shackled, he said. `` The purpose of the handcuffs is for security,'' he said. `` We are concerned about the safety of both staff and inmates.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> would not comment on the specifics of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> suit. Four guards and two inmates hurt in the rioting remain hospitalized.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered his thanks today, on the first anniversary of his election, to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for choosing him and said he would move to `` shed light in the dark corners of American life.'' The president called an Election day news conference to mark the occasion. `` I'm very pleased that our administration has come together rapidly with good people and with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose,'' he said in an opening statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with his record in international and national affairs, saying he had seen the greatest surge toward democracy around the world in at least 40 years. And, he said, he had responded to those challenges. Critics have called him overly cautious in reacting to changes sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He cited his forthcoming meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>; plans for a formal summit after that; his proposal for aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and his support for international efforts to bolster the movement throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> toward free market economies and democratic forms of government. Throughout that area, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` important decisions have been made for freedom and we've supported those movements.'' At home, the president said, he is `` more convinced today than ever that we can shed light in the dark corners of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and offer hope to the needy. He promised to continue a bipartisan approach toward <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said more had to be done to combat the federal deficit, repeated his pledge to oppose any new federal taxes and basked in `` the underlying strength of the American economy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited `` the longest expansion in history,'' and low rates of unemployment and inflation. `` I want to thank the American people on this Election Day for giving me this opportunity to serve,'' he said. `` I enjoy it.''

 Voters stood in lines more than a mile long today as balloting began in an election that is to lead to independence for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony. Authorities reported violations of election rules and at least one attempt to distribute bogus pamphlets but said there had been no major disturbances. `` The behavior of the voting public has been an example to the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, spokesman for the South African-installed territorial government. The U.N.-monitored elections are for a 72-member assembly that is to write a constitution. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 74 years, is expected to become independent early next year. `` After all the years of waiting, the people of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> themselves, and no one else, will have their say in free and fair elections,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, said in a radio broadcast as five days of voting began in the southern African territory. There are 701,488 registered voters in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, about 60 percent of them illiterate. The population was 1.3 million in 1981, when the last census was taken, but is believed to be far higher now. The key issue in the elections was whether the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, favored to win the most votes, would capture the two-thirds majority needed to write a constitution without consulting any of the other nine parties. `` Today we are finally burying apartheid colonialism,'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> told reporters at a polling station in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, the main black neighborhood on the edge of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. `` There is a beautiful lady expecting a baby,'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> told a cheering, singing crowd at a rally Monday night. `` That lady is mother <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and that baby is the freedom and independence of this land.'' The queue of voters stretched for about 1.2 miles when the polls opened in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>. Long lines also were reported elsewhere. Namibians may vote daily through Saturday and Chief Electoral Officer <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Visser </PERSON> said he was confident results would be available Nov. 15. More than 7,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military and civilian representatives _ one for every 1,000 voters _ are in predominantly black <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and have supervised a massive campaign to promote voting and prevent fraud. Posters and television advertisements financed by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and territorial officials have stressed that ballots will be secret and urged voters to `` vote without fear.'' All voters are required to dip their fingers in invisible ink after they cast their ballot. The ink is indelible for five days. When voters enter the booths at the polling stations they must put their fingers under an ultra-violet light, which will reveal the ink if they already have voted. Officials said most of this sparsely populated desert territory now is tranquil. But the four-month election campaign was marked by sporadic violence and intimidation, including the Sept. 12 assassination of the only ranking white in <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> cautioned that `` the peace is a very fragile peace.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> noted Monday in a final pre-election report that almost one in 10 Namibians had a gun permit and an unknown number were armed illegally. `` While at this time there have been marked improvements in the security situation on the eve of the election, I remain vigilant to the possibility of a deterioration in the field of law and order,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. In neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> urged Namibians to `` cast your vote in the interest of peace and prosperity.'' `` The strife and bitterness, the mistrust and misunderstandings of the past must be put behind us,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> seized mineral-rich <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from its German colonizers in 1915. The League of Nations, forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, provided <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with a mandate to administer the territory. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> revoked the mandate in 1966 and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> launched a guerrilla war later that year after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to grant independence. More than 20,000 people, mostly <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, died in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war that finally ended in April. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said his left-leaning organization would accept any election result certified by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The organization once espoused a Marxist-Leninist one-party state, but <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> last month promised that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> `` has no intention of imposing a one-party political system on the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> people against their will.'' Its chief rival is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a moderate, multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part of a South African-installed transitional government.

<HEAD>Text of President Bush's News Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Tuesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, good morning. And I _ I'm back again _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- and I just heard you, Brit _ I've got to be careful on these dates. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Today is November 7th, and I was elected on November 8th, but it was the second Tuesday. And so I want to take this election day, the anniversary of my own election, to briefly reflect on the last 10 months. I believe that we've had, so far, a successful first year in office. And although we have n't reached the actual anniversary mark, January 20th, it's a good chance to take stock of the situation, particularly as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is winding down. There is legislation yet to be passed, and certainly opportunities to be developed. But I'm very pleased that our administration has come together rapidly with good people, with good ideas, and with a quiet sense of purpose that promises great progress in the years ahead. And around the world we've seen the most dramatic moves toward democracy in at least 40 years, as people of one country after another have expressed their yearning for freedom. And in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> important decisions have been made for freedom or reforms. And we've supported those efforts with a substantial aid package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, trade benefits for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a bipartisan agreement <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, coordinated international support for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> reforms, special arms control initiatives on chemical weapons and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and then in progress in START talks In addition, we've set the timeframe for a summit with the Soviets, and we're on the verge of an informal meeting with President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. One area that has not changed is the underlying strength of the American economy. We have the longest peacetime economic expansion in history, 119 million Americans at work, the creation of over 20 million new jobs since 1982. The unemployment rate is only 5.3 percent, a rate that we've not achieved for a full year since 1970. Inflation remains moderate. I'm not happy with it, but it's moderate and appears to be under control Though the economy is sound, we must make real progress on deficit reduction. Sequestration is a drastic action, but neither the administration nor the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must flinch from our obligation to keep this nation's deficit moving down and ultimately reduce the debt. And I am pleased that I have kept my pledge on taxes. Our savings and loan system has been redesigned, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accepted my proposals giving our workers a higher minimum wage, and establishing a training wage for the first time. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan for dealing with the Third World debt has been successfully demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Many nations' problems remain unsolved, but the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan is widely accepted It's in the setting of internal strength that we are poised to deal effectively with external change, and to provide new directions for our society. At the education summit and in legislative initiatives on clean air, ethics, educational excellence, violent crime, child care, and our national drug strategy, we offer new approaches for improving the quality of our lives. And so I urge the Congress to move quickly to enact these proposals. My approach to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been based on a bipartisan effort. I think everybody here knows that. It started off with an effort to work with the leadership in a bipartisan manner, and so we could reach agreement on major issues. In the course of our debates, there have sometimes been pointed and somewhat sharp attacks, but I am going to continue to extend my hand to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in seeking solutions to the challenges that we face.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will veto a $ 14.4 billion foreign aid bill if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> insists on including a provision authorizing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' family planning agency `` They are asking me to accept things I can not accept,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to a question at a White House news conference. He said he could not approve the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax dollars for programs that require abortions in such overpopulated countries as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, continuing work on a foreign aid bill, agreed Monday on the provision involving family planning efforts through the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>. As they worked through a long list of disagreements, conferees for the two sides agreed to accept <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language that would reverse a five-year policy and send $ 15 million to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund in fiscal 1990 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, under pressure from anti-abortion groups, had said earlier that he would veto the bill if it included money for the Population Fund. The agency carries on programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where its opponents say severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced abortions and sterilizations. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees voted 8-3 to accept the Senate-passed provision, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., that also stipulated none of the money could go directly into programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Administration officials said late Monday they believed the provision giving money to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency still could be overturned when a compromise bill goes back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for final approval. The negotiators hoped to complete work on the measure on Wednesday and send it back to both chambers for approval. The aid for Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> included $ 200 million towards a $ 1 billion international fund to stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy, and money to set up private sector development programs of $ 45 million in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 5 million in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. A series of smaller initiatives would promote environmental cleanups in both countries, educational and cultural exchanges, <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> activities and the efforts of union and other groups to promote democratic change. In addition, the bill would make available $ 200 million to guarantee payment for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 40 million in risk insurance for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial ventures through the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Because of questions about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s credit worthiness, it is unclear whether those funds will be tapped Both countries have been on the forefront of changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the result of failing economies under communism and of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s looser grip. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this year elected its first non-communist government in four decades and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has torn down border fences that form its part of the Iron Curtain. The conference committee also agreed to put $ 125 million into new military, intelligence and law enforcement efforts in the war on drugs in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Another issue that had been the basis for a veto threat appeared to be evaporating, said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., because the administration had decided against a fight That was a provision, stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, that would bar the use of foreign aid money to carry out any policy contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. Other major differences remained, however. One was an accounting gimmick used in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill to meet its 1990 budget target, which would force some $ 500 million in spending into the following fiscal year. The House was strenuously opposed to that maneuver.

 WASHN: we face. I spoke ten months ago of a kinder and gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and I'm more convinced today than ever that we can shed light in the dark corners of our nation and give hope to the homeless and help to the needy, inspiration to millions of Americans who want to reach out and help their neighbors And I am pleased at the progress on this so-called `` points of light'' initiative. These challenges, coupled with our successes to date, have made these first ten months especially gratifying to me, and give me great hope for the future. So I, on this occasion of the election _ anniversary of the election _ I want to thank the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people on this election day for giving me this opportunity to serve. I'm enjoying it I like the challenge. And I'll be glad to take questions. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>? Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is returning $ 567 million in frozen assets to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but says the action is not related to the plight of the eight Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, in line with your comment that goodwill brings goodwill, do you hope that this will encourage <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help win the hostages' release? A: Well, as I say, I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day. So of course I hope that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will use what influence it has to get these hostages released. Q: Well, do you think that this could be a catalyst Mr. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. ... A: I do n't know, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. It's a very good question, and I do n't know the answer to that They owe money _ you know, they _ we have accounts that _ where they owe <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests money, and vice versa. And I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out now. I think they have made some positive statements. But I do n't whether it will work that way, or not. I hope _ I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold these hostages. We're continuing behind the scenes to try _ go follow certain `` rabbit trails'' there And so far, they have ended up at dead ends. Q Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? A: Yes, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>? Q: Despite your aid packages to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and so forth, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says you've really been slow on the uptake on one of the most transforming politicals events of our time. You have failed to show the leadership, you've failed to put the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ahead of the curve on these things that are happening. And you are going to the summit without any initiatives at all, and you _ I mean, at least you've boasted about it. Why do n't you have some new ideas of what to talk about? A: Now, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, that is not a `` kinder and gentler'' way to phrase your question. We have done plenty. And the fact that some critics are out there equating progress with spending more money does n't bother me in the least. Look at the dynamic changes that are taking place around the world. Q -LRB- inaudible -RRB- A: Well, I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than `` triple the spending'' on every initiative. We are working closely with our allies. We are trying to facilitate the change. I do n't hear complaints coming out of our allies or, indeed, out of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> We've got a seasoned team that is evaluating the change. I will have a wonderful opportunity to discuss the change with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But I ca n't be all concerned when people jump up and say the answer is to spend more money! Q: No, that is n't it. A: Well, what is their answer? Q: The perception is that European leaders are leading the way and are telling you what is really happening, and we have been sitting back and letting it all happen without doing anything. A: Well, that's the perception of some that are n't quite as familiar with the problem as I am, and it is not the perception of the

The cadet, who was n't identified, also was ordered by the school to perform 100 hours of public service at the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said academy spokesman Col. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> on Monday. Officials at the academy and the humane society said Monday they received several calls from spectators, faculty members and cadets about mistreatment of the birds. People complained that a cheerleader had swung a chicken by its head and that a second chicken was tossed into the crowd, which batted it around before releasing it, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, shelter manager at the humane society. `` What started off as a very typical service academy prank got out of hand,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` It was a very unfortunate incident committed by a cheerleader who was caught up in the emotion of what has become a very fierce inter-service rivalry.'' The chickens were released on the field by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> cadets during halftime events before 52,000 spectators. Both are `` alive and scratching around the back yard'' of the academy's game warden until a home can be found for them, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. Academy officials would not release the cadet's name because the incident did not result in criminal charges.

 The army has captured a ring of Moslem fundamentalists in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> who are believed to have kidnapped and killed two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, the military announced today. The body of one victim was never found, but an army statement said interrogation of the suspects yielded the first concrete evidence that the soldier, reported missing in May, was slain after being abducted. The trooper, 18-year-old <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastal town of <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, would be the 41st Israeli slain in the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. At least 612 Arabs have been killed by Israelis during the 22-month revolt. The latest death occurred today, when riot police shot and killed a Palestinian teen-ager in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. The army said he was killed during a clash with stone-throwers. Arab reports said at least three other teen-agers were wounded in the same protest. Also today, the body of a 28-year-old Palestinian was found in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> with multiple stab wounds. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said he was suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities. The victim, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Samhan </PERSON>, was the 142nd Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs during the uprising. The army did not give the number of suspects arrested in the soldiers' deaths. It said the ring's leader was among those detained. It added that the three prime suspects have fled the country. The statement said evidence gathered in the case `` has strengthened the belief that the soldier <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON> was kidnapped and killed as well, similarly to <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, and was buried somewhere in Israeli territory.'' <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON> was last seen by a fellow soldier entering a white sedan in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on May 3. The suspects are also believed involved in the Feb. 16 kidnapping and slaying of 21-year-old soldier <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, who disappeared while hitchhiking home. His body was found May 7 in a grove near the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A police inquiry published today recommended that six policemen be fired and put under criminal investigation for the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old Palestinian in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on Oct. 26. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said the recommendations for firing and investigating the six officers were given to National Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, who was reviewing them. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted the findings as saying the policemen are suspected of causing death, fabricating evidence and giving false testimony. The inquiry was launched after Israeli newspapers quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses as saying the 18-year-old Palestinian was shot at point-blank range, not during a car chase as police reported.

 An interstate highway was slathered with four flavors of yogurt early today after a delivery truck slammed into a tractor-trailer in thick fog. Hundreds of cartons spilled onto Interstate 684 and broke, closing the major commuting route in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs for five hours. Firefighters washed the sticky substance from the road just before rush hour. `` We were knee deep in yogurt,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Conservative Leader Receives Mandate To Try To Form Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> received a mandate today to try to form a new government. Party officials said he faces a difficult time. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party won the most parliamentary seats in Sunday's elections but just missed a majority, got the exploratory mandate from President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> has until Friday to drum up enough support to persuade the president to let him go before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with the proposed government for a vote of confidence. `` In three days I will return to the president and inform him of the results of my efforts,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference. New Democracy defeated <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> PASOK </LOCATION>, in national elections for the second time in five months. However, it failed to win the 151 seats necessary for a parliamentary majority. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who governed <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from 1981 to the June elections, will be given a chance to form a government if <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> fails. The former premier has 128 seats in the 300-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, compared to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>'s 148. The third-largest party, the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, has said it will not give the conservatives or the socialists its 21 seats. Three independents were also elected. New Democracy officials said they expected <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> to have a tough time gathering enough support for a government, especially since one of the independents was allied with the leftist parties. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said he will not enter any alliance that will force his party to water down its program to revive the economy and seek closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties. A continued deadlock among the parties could lead to a third set of elections this year. The conservatives were not enthusiastic about the possibility. `` I do n't see new elections right now, for the simple reason that no one -LRB- of the parties -RRB- wants them, nor do the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people. Only in the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,'' said <PERSON> Ioannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaiokrassas </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> member. If all three main parties fail to form a government the president will invite them to put together a joint administration. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> supports a government of all three parties. New Democracy and the Coalition formed an alliance after the inconclusive June poll. That alliance was dedicated solely to investigating <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and former ministers in his administration. It resigned in October shortly after the former premier and five of his ministers were indicted by Parliament. Another set of elections would not necessarily produce a strong government. The proportional electoral system introduced by <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> before the June elections makes it very difficult for any party to win a parliamentary majority.

 Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> entered the voting booth today with a big lead in opinion polls but with mayoral rival <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> snapping at his heels with allegations of financial irregularities. `` I hope we prevail, of course,'' said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who has accused the Republican of running a negative campaign. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> emerged with confidence after casting his ballot. Today's election will decide the successor to Democrat <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the outspoken symbol of the city for 12 years. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> stopped off at a police precinct before voting to `` say goodbye to the cops.'' Should <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, the former federal prosecutor, pull off an upset, he would become the city's first <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mayor elected since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> in 1965. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, would be the city's first black mayor. A weekend poll of 3,010 likely voters by <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> leading 56 percent to 42 percent. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' backers planned a massive get-out-the-vote effort, using 12,000 volunteers. Workers staffing a 600-line phone bank were encouraging 300,000 supporters to vote and more than 100 sound trucks were being deployed. More than 60 percent of the city's nearly 3.2 million voters were expected to turn out. Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5-1. The candidates spent Monday in familiar poses: <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> surrounded by prominent Democrats like <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whom he defeated in September's primary; Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, speaking of `` unity and tolerance.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, surrounded by supportive police officers, sharply questioned <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' financial dealings. `` So many serious questions have been raised about my opponent that this election has become a referendum on integrity,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said in a speech downtown. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> was referring to alleged financial transgressions, including <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' admitted failure to pay taxes 20 years ago and the payment of $ 9,500 to an ex-convict to get out the vote in the primary. He sold cable-television stock he once valued at $ 1 million to his son for $ 58,000. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has a history of getting away with things that others do n't get away with,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. The latest allegation was that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> failed to list on financial disclosure or tax forms that a friend paid in part for a trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said it is unclear whether such a gift must be listed on financial disclosure forms, but added he would amend his statement anyway `` in order to provide the fullest possible disclosure.'' He dismissed the accusation as `` desperate'' and called on supporters to reject `` the scurrilous politics of divide and conquer.'' `` We've rejected the negative politics of slam and slander _ and stayed on the high ground of substantive dialogue and moral leadership,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> told cheering supporters at a rally. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who has never held elective office, projected himself as an outsider who can clean up a scandal-scarred municipal government and portrayed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> as a product of Democratic `` clubhouse politics.'' `` I enter City Hall with no strings, no deals, no ethical or legal problems that will envelop my administration,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` delaying too long'' in responding to the initiatives of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the rebirth of democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We have got to get our act together,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said on Monday in the strongest criticism he has offered to date on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s performance in office <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today dismissed such criticism, although he made no direct reference to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. At a White House news conference, the president challenged critics to come up with specific ideas `` other than triple the spending'' on aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, contrary to the basis of one question, that leaders in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` do n't seem to agree'' with some of the poltical criticism he gets in connection with his dealings with nations that have been in the Soviet sphere since World War II. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a reunion with the people who staffed his campaigns and administration, told an audience there is `` substantial proof'' that at least in some areas <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is producing irreversible change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The response of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` does n't match what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is doing,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` I think we are delaying too long in responding effectively to this change that is occurring,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said during a seminar sponsored by the Center for National Policy on the subject of `` waging peace.'' In the absence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a policy vacuum occurs that can not be filled by the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or any other nation, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` The spokesman for the Western world has got to be the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` I think we need to be able to respond to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because he is winning a tremendous propaganda victory in all of the many countries I have visited.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s vice president and who himself sought the presidency, echoed <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s complaints. `` I think now is the time to strike,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` I think the circumstances are such that we need a much more rapid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy response.'' `` They speak to us in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of the joy of democracy and freedom,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` We sort of come back in the language of bookkeepers and bureaucrats.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs, another participant in the seminar, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does have to encourage and respond vigorously'' to rapidly evolving events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but the administration is looking for `` elements of irreversibility'' in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rise to power `` one of the transforming political developments of our lifetime,'' citing the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet encouragement of the Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms control initiatives and willingness to permit independent policies in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. `` It's hard to find fault with what he says,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` In some cases there is substantial proof he means what he says.'' The former president also challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to more closely engage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in pursuing peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must make it clear he intends to vigorously pursue a peace agreement with all the means at his disposal and will not withdraw until it is achieved. Using the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has monitored the electoral process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said he wants `` to make it extremely difficult _ impossible _ for either party to withdraw from the election when one side or the other discovers it is likely to lose.'' `` Once they get involved in a highly publicized peace effort, its difficult for them to withdraw,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` It would be devastating for them in terms of their public relations.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he believes Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` made a tragic and deplorable mistake'' last week when he announced cancellation of a cease-fire with the rebels. But he said he does not believe <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s action `` is going to interfere with the holding of an election.'' And <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he believes recent attacks by Contra rebels across the Honduran border into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have been aimed at disrupting the process of registering voters. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who was hailed by participants in the reunion for his accomplishments as a former president in the fields of health, education, housing, and conflict resolution, used the occasion to appeal for funds to raise a $ 50 million endowment to perpetuate the work of the Carter center.

 Gay rights, a proposed smoking ordinance in the heart of tobacco-land, and the fate of a championship baseball club are among key ballot issues voters were deciding today. In all, residents of 10 states will consider 56 statewide issues, 21 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> alone. Scores of citywide issues also are being contested in this off-year election. As has often been the case, many of the most controversial local contests are in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents, fresh from a major earthquake, weighed a proposal to raise more than $ 100 million for a new stadium to keep the National League champion <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> from fleeing. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> also were considering a `` domestic partners'' measure entitling unmarried couples employed by that city to the same funeral and sick-leave benefits as married couples. The issue of discrimination against AIDS victims got its first-ever ballot test in nearby <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, where voters were deciding whether to repeal a recent ordinance protecting the rights of those victims. In affluent <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, voters were considering deleting a section of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb's human rights ordinance that outlaws discrimination against homosexuals. Backers of the proposal say the measure could promote immorality. Opponents including Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Agran </PERSON> called the repeal effort homophobic. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are among cities with gay rights provisions. In <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where the tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employs 2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered voters smoke, voters decided whether to ban smoking in elevators and in certain stores, and require restaurants seating more than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mo.-area voters weighed a sales-tax increase to raise $ 14 million to wage a war on rising drug abuse. Voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> considered a sweeping charter revision to bring it into compliance with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order to make its legislature more representative. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, voters considered a 4-cent property tax hike to subsidize the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>. Orchestra officials say they ca n't raise any more money from the wealthy or ticket buyers. Critics in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> legislature have called the symphony elitist. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> residents considered a measure ending forced school busing and promoting educational choice. Among statewide issues: _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> residents considered hefty sales-tax increases aimed at raising hundreds of millions of dollars for education. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` Children's Initiative'' would hike the sales tax by nearly a penny per dollar to help raise at least $ 360 million a year for smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse and drug education. _ <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> residents decideed whether the state should spend $ 56 million for ski jumps and ice rinks that could bring that state the 1998 Olympic Winter Games. _ In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a non-binding referendum asks whether voters want the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to stop testing Tomahawk cruise missiles over their state. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began testing the missiles over <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> last winter. Voters decided whether to approve an agreement to dispose of nuclear waste from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> at a facility in <LOCATION> Beatty </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> _ In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the ballot is laden with 21 propositions, questions include whether to triple the current $ 7,200 salaries of state legislatures, whether to authorize a $ 500 million bond issue aimed at bringing running water and sewers to disease-ridden border towns, whether to enshrine a `` victim's bill of rights'' in the state constitution, and whether to finance a record $ 400 million build-up of the state's prison system. Texans will decided whether to drop a 113-year-old provision requiring state office-holders to publicly affirm that they did n't bribe their way into their positions Some consider the oath demeaning, but at least one official who recently took it said he did n't mind. `` I kind of like it,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayoud </PERSON>. `` During my swearing in, there were people from around the state here and they said they liked it.''

<BYLINE>EDs: Top 8 grafs new with Dole and Mitchell complaining about stall
tactics, Bush comment on domestic agenda. Editing throughout. ^By JOHN

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders today urged colleagues to stop using delaying tactics preventing final passage of a compromise plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.25. Both Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called on any senators who plan to offer amendments to the proposal to come forward. A few senators have indicated they might propose amendments, and debate has been all but stopped because none has actually done so. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said they hoped a final vote on the minimum wage could come today so the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could concentrate on negotiations to raise the government's debt ceiling. The possible amendments range from an attempt to revive President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a capital gains tax cut to technical changes in the minimum-wage bill. Most are considered little more than attempts to delay final passage of the measure because of partisan disputes, particularly those over capital gains and efforts to raise the government's debt limit. `` This is, of course, a situation with which we in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have become all too familiar,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said of the delay. `` It is important we finish minimum wage, get some agreement to vote,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. The minimum-wage bill was among several President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mentioned at a morning news conference at which he said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was moving too slowly on his domestic agenda. `` I urge the Congress to move quickly on these proposals,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate began Monday and only two senators spoke despite <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s urging that any senators with amendments step forward. During that debate, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for compromising with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the minimum wage Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, predicted easy passage of the measure but said it would hurt the economy. `` The nine-year stalemate over the minimum wage is finally broken,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` We certainly welcome that change of attitude between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.'' The increase would be the first since the federal wage floor hit $ 3.35 in 1981. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the increase would not help many working poor but would cause wage and price inflation. `` Every good and material that is sold in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to go up in cost,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` I think that means we're going to have some very difficult economic times in the future. I hope I'm wrong. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> countered by calling the planned increase `` a very small adjustment'' that still would leave minimum-wage earners well behind price inflation since the last increase in 1981. `` May we do everything in our power to make sure that the working poor never have to wait that long again,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The proposal, which also would create a subminimum for teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck a week ago between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats. The measure provides two 45-cent increases, one next April 1 and the other a year later. It also allows employers to pay a lower wage to workers age 16 to 19 with less than three months total job experience. The subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the workers were in certified training programs. The subminimum would be $ 3.35 beginning next April 1 and rise to $ 3.61 on April 1, 1991. The provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.

<TEXT>
 A fetus carried by an Asian elephant for a record two years is probably dead, say veterinarians at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. `` The chances are essentially nil that she is carrying a live fetus, but there's still an outside chance because she is healthy,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oosterhuis </PERSON>, park director of veterinary services, said Monday. The average gestation period for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> elephants is 618 to 648 days. The pregnancy of 19-year-old <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> reached 725 days Monday, surpassing that of an Asian elephant that went 720 days before giving birth at a German zoo. Veterinarians attempted an endoscopy on the pachyderm last week, but the 5-foot instrument for getting a glimpse of the fetus was n't long enough Park staffers located two longer instruments after more than a dozen phone calls, but the endoscopy is n't needed immediately because <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> appears healthy. Veterinarians had not decided whether to induce labor or allow nature to take its course. They are concerned the fetus, which weighs 185 to 200 pounds, could pass an infection to its 2 -LCB- - ton mother, <PERSON> Oosterhuis </PERSON> said `` If she were sick and the going got tough, then we would have to deal with it immediately,'' <PERSON> Oosterhuis </PERSON> said.

So we're getting way out ahead of the _ of the _ where reality is But I was asked the question, and I answered it open, straight.

Yeah _ -LRB- name inaudible -RRB- _ and then <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. Q: When <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> first came to power in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, you said it was way too early to say whether he represented more of the same, which seemed to be your sense at the time, or whether he represented the leading edge of further reform. Seeing the dramatic events unfold in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, what is your conclusion about <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, his intentions and his direction? A: I think it's still too early to sum it up entirely. But, some of what he has said about political reform is quite encouraging and really contradicts the very early, I would say, global assessment of the man. In other words, he _ the early predictions were that he's a hardliner in the mode of Mr. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> And now, some of what he is saying is quite different from that. And Mrs. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s not there any more, so you're seeing some changes _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ -LRB- laughing -RRB- _ you're seeing some changes. Q: -LRB- inaudible -RRB-. A: Well, she's out as a minister, and another minister, and you're beginning to see changes that might _ might _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ what are you guys laughing at? _ -LRB- laughing -RRB- _ a new order. So it's _ it _ look, we've got to be _ this gets me back almost to <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s Things are happening very fast. The concerted opinion was that this was going to be another hardliner in the mode of Mr. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. Now there's some signs that that's not the case. So we will watch that very carefully. Yeah, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q: If I may follow up, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, do you feel that things have now gone too far in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the clock to be turned back, for a Tiananmen Square-type crackdown? And do you feel any need to assist the West Germans in all of this? A: Well, the West Germans have not requested assistance. And I am in very close touch with the federal chancellor. And I'm most anxious to talk to him when he returns from his six-day visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. I talked to him just very recently, as a matter of fact, about what we're doing. And that's why I _ I've stated rather confidently that European leaders do n't seem to agree _ when I answered <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s question _ with some of the political criticism I get from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> or elsewhere. So, I _ what was the first part? Q: Gone too far? A: Oh. No, I do n't think you can ever say `` gone too far.'' I mean, who predicted with certainty what would happen in Tiananmen Square? But, I think it's gone too far to irreversibly _ I mean, to set back these fledgling _ I d A: No. Q: Well, how committed are you? Why are you vetoing all of the other programs? A: Because I ca n't in good conscience on this one suggest that taxpayers' money ought to go to programs that compel abortion, and hat has been the problem with the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> program. And therefore, I ca n't do that. ... Q: -LRB- inaudible -RRB- ... our money is ... A: _ I ca n't do it, and I'm sorry, but I am not going to change that policy. I am strongly in favor, and always have been, of family planning. I've been out front for family planning for a long time, and as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> way back there. But, I simply can not support _ and I've asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to try to make me change a policy where the AID people will tell you it supports compulsory abortion. I am not going to do that. Q: But, the American money is. ... A: And there's other things in that bill that I do n't like, too, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>. This _ this leveraging provision _ I mean, should I be told by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that I ca n't go and ask other countries to support <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>? Should I? Q: I do n't know about the leveraging. ... A: Well, I do, and that's one of the things that's wrong with it. So I am concerned. Now, that's kind of a post-Iran-Contra thing. They're saying you ca n't go get money for certain things. But in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intervening in the president's authority like this, they are asking me to accept things that I am not going to accept. MORE

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that he does n't believe voters cast their ballots on the single issue of abortion, nor is it the most important issue on his agenda `` I think our party is broad enough to contain differing views on this and I think the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House news conference. `` I do n't believe most voters are single issue voters. There is no evidence to support that, none at all,'' he said, citing data by his campaign pollster, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, showing the issue of abortion ranked between ninth and 14th on the list of what voters consider most important. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had `` no intention of changing my position'' on abortion. The president opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment to the mother's life. He opposes federal money to fund abortions for poor women. `` Abortion divides,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, acknowledging the volatile atmosphere on abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave states increased power to restrict it this year. `` Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently vetoed a $ 157.6 billion funding package for the departments of Education, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> because of abortion-funding provisions. `` It's just so personal,'' he said. `` I just come down more on the side of life. ...

<TEXT>
 The red star atop <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s neo-gothic parliament building will be replaced next year by a weather vane, which adorned the structure before the Communist takeover. The government decided this year to remove the red star _ the symbol of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> dominance _ from all public buildings as part of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s democratic reforms. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the parliamentary office has asked for those interested in the contract to remove the star to submit bids by Nov. 20. The light in the star was extinguished last month and the star will come down in spring. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the removal would cost about $ 66,000. Officials would like to reas remove it, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. The spherical weather vane that crowned the building before the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover will resume its place atop the building's dome. During the 1956 anti-Stalinist revolt in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the rebels tried to pull the star down, but <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> noted that `` the stunt, which would have tested the skills of steeplejacks, failed.'' Church restorers and roofers were among those who have indicated interest in bidding for the contract, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

In the sole congressional seat on the ballot, 11 candidates vied to fill out the term of the late Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, killed in a plane crash last summer in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, his state's lieutenant governor, battled former attorney general <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in a contest in the old capital of the Confederacy that focused more on abortion than race. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the 62-year-old <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, ran as the man who could bring racial harmony to the Big Apple. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, 45 and a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney making his first try for elective office, hammered away at his rival's transfer of stock to a son and his failure to file income-tax returns for four years two decades ago. Big-city mayors on the ballot included <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, each seeking their fifth term; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> seeking his fourth and <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, going after his third. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> picked a new black mayor, choosing between City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in a particularly bitter race. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> called his rival a `` slumlord.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said his opponent was a `` master of sleaze.''

But just as Republicans and Democrats watched the returns for signs of partisan success, so, too, was the year marked by interest in abortion and race _ with a heavy dose of negative campaign commercials thrown in.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The elections were closely watched for clues to shifting voter sentiment on abortion in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last summer that permits states to restrict the rights of women seeking to end their pregnancies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a news conference marking the first anniversary of his own election, minimized the importance of abortion in this year's campaign and said people `` are not for the most part single-issue voters They care about war and peace, they care about the environment.'' Even so, the issue played a role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and particularly in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where pro-choice and pro-life groups bought television commercials to boost <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, respectively. In all three races, Republican candidates were thrown on the defensive by their pro-choice opponents. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> made the issue the cornerstone of his candidacy, running television commercials in October that accused <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of wanting to `` take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians,'' even on abortions in cases of incest and rape. His campaign challenged a decade of conventional political wisdom which held that abortion was an issue best ignored by a pro-choice candidate and best exploited by one with right-to-life views. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> both softened their original pro-life positions as the campaigns wore on. The issue of race was largely silent in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> until the final days, when <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> suggested his rival had been the beneficiary of a `` double standard'' in press coverage. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s rebuttal: campaigning on Saturday with a woman who said she was originally a <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> supporter, but changed her mind after his comments. The current governor, Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, is barred by state law from seeking a second consecutive term. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> race was to succeed three-term Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> defeated the outgoing mayor in a primary in which he depicted himself as the man capable of calming the racial antagonism that often flares in the city. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who established a natiional reputation as a prosecutor of white-collar criminals, said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> needed to be investigated for his failure to pay income taxes and for allegedly covering up the details of a stock tranfer to his son. `` I do n't want someone voting for me because I am white,'' he said. I do n't think that's right. And I think the same thing is true of my opponent. No one should vote for him because he's black. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> replied, `` I ask that nobody vote for me because I an African-American, but I ask as well that nobody vote against me because I am an African-American.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> race was between two men who could n't have been less alike. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, the liberal Democrat, lost a gubernatorial primary in 1977 and came within 1,700 votes of winning the governor's job in 1981. The man who beat him, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, is stepping down after two terms as required by the state Constitution. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, a conservative Republican was making his first try for statewide office. Their race was nasty for weeks. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> struck with campaign commercials in October that showed <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s nose growing longer and longer as a narrator ticked off a series of alleged lies and misleading statements. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> lashed back with a variation on the same theme: the faces of the two men side by side, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s nose growing longer and longer and his own shorter and shorter.

 WASHN: to accept. Q: May I follow up on the abortion. ... A: How many follow-ups do you get? -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: This is my follow-up. In the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> family planning program, the American money would not have anything to do with abortion, and also in the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> bill that you vetoed, the federal money would not go to abortion. You seem to be saying you want to affect the policy beyond the federal role. A: Well, look, there are many issues, and abortion divides. We have room in our party for people that feel one way, pro-life or pro-choice. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the same way. I think everyone knows that this is an issue that divides. But you say, is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not. Yes? Q: You're probably ready for this one, but you campaigned as an environmentalist and said you were a strong environmentalist. Yet on the issue of global warming, it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is being dragged kicking and screaming into trying to address this problem. How do you respond to that? A: I respond to it by saying it's not true. Q: Why are you resisting the moves in this international conference now? A: We're just standing off against extremes. We have a unanimous communique out of that global conference. We have an outstanding environmentalist in <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. We have an outstanding scientist in Dr. <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>. They agree that our approach to all of this is right. And I think we can not be _ this policy of the environment can not be driven by the extremes. But I would like to take your question to challenge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to go forward on the revisions to the Clean Air Act, on other initiatives that we have supported, instead of sitting back there and carping about it. And if they do n't like our way, go ahead and try it and then add to it in later years. But they sit there and argue back and forth with each other, and nothing happens. In this global conference, I can tell you <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' science is the best in terms of global warming. And we will be in the lead as we are now with our science on global warming. But you ca n't take a policy and drive it to the extreme and say to every country around the world, `` You are n't going to grow at all. We've got to use our science to help solve this problem. Yes, back there _ these two in the middle. Q: Mr. President, the gubernatorial campaigns, as you know, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were dominated by the abortion issue. Some pro-choice Republicans are disturbed with your current position. What advice are you going to give Republicans legislators and congressional candidates next year when the Democrats start pounding on them on this issue? A: Well, they've already started. Those who favor _ favor the pro-choice have already started pounding on them, and started certainly pounding on me. But you see, one, I think our party is broad enough to contain differing views on this. Secondly _ and I think the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is. You see that. You see that out there in practice. Secondly, I do n't believe that most voters are single issue voters. There is no evidence to support that. None at all. Indeed _ I hate to talk about polls, because I do n't believe them when I see ugly things _ but I can tell you that that issue ranks about 9th to 14th, if you talk to a pollster like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>. I ca n't remember whether it was 14th or 9th, so I'm giving you a range there. But people are not, for the most part, single issue voters. They care about war and peace. They care about the environment. They care about education. They care about anti-narcotics. They care about crime in their neighborhoods. So when you see all this attention to this question, I happen to think it's those that are editorializing, the columnists, or some in the political arena that think the voter is a one-issue voter. I do n't agree with that, and I've seen no evidence. Q: But if Republicans cling to the hope that you might change your position, are they wrong that you're going to. ... A: I have no intention of changing my position. It's _ it's so personal. It's so _ um _ I just come down more on the side of life. I mentioned in my speech last year at the _ a year-plus ago _ of adoption and what it's meant. And _ but I _ look, I do n't fault people that view this differently. As I say, there's a _ plenty of room for difference. But it's not one, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, where people are as single-issue, as you would _ as some would like to believe. Yes, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>? Q: Mr. President, your predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, just came back from a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he collected $ 2 million for his speaking engagements. Eventually, you're going to be an ex-president. Is that the kind of behavior that you anticipate yourself endorsing _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ accepting that kind of money? A: I will not have anything negative to say about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ if that's an invitation for this _ because I prefer to emphasize the positive _ positive parts of that trip, talking openly about the need for freer trade, the affection shown to him by the Japanese people. It's important symbolism when it comes to the _ when it comes to this relationship that sometimes has strain. And what happens in the future? I do n't know. Yes? Q: Excuse me, a follow up, sir? MORE

<HEAD>Church of England Synod Supports Principle of Women Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s General Synod voted Tuesday in favor of the principle of women priests, the first step toward the possible ordination of women by the state church. On the first day of a two-day debate, members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> passed by a simple majority the first clause of a proposed amendement to canon law to permit the ordination of women. The change was supported by all three branches of the synod, the church's parliament. The bishops voted 30-17 in favor, the clergy 149-85 in favor and the lay members 144-78 in favor. The issue of women's ordination now goes to the 43 dioceses for discussion by ordinary members of the church. This is expected to start next year. It is unlikely the question of ordaining women will return to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> for a final vote until 1992, when it will require a two-thirds majority. Some of the loudest applause during debate was given to the bishop of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, the Right Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who said: `` Ordination of women to the priesthood is not the end of the world. If the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s making a mistake were the end of the world, the world would have ended long ago.'' The bishop of <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, the Right Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON>, said he would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally passed, despite being a supporter of women priests. He said he did not want to have to choose between favoring opponents or supporters among his congregations. About 1,200 women have been ordained in Anglican churches, mainly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The ordination of women has been a major point of contention between Anglicans and Roman Catholics in their ecumenical encounters. The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has been debating the issue for two decades, and some opponents among the clergy and laity have said they will break away if women are ordained. The clause approved by the synod reads: `` It shall be lawful for the General Synod to make provision by canon -LRB- church law -RRB- for enabling a woman to be ordained to the office of priest if she otherwise satisfies the requirements of <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> as to the persons who may be ordained as priests. `` Nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be consecrated to the office of bishop.'' At the start of the debate, Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of women to proceed in the dioceses, despite remaining undecided on the basic principle of women priests. `` I judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring forward,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he is willing to meet with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> so long as the two sides have `` something positive to talk about'' on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pln for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't know if or when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> intends to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but he is `` certainly willing to consider'' a meeting. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has given its qualified acceptance of the proposal by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for talks between Israelis and Palestinians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is asking for a half-dozen assurances, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promise to quit the talks if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> walks out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials are now looking for word from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on their stands. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is making a `` real effort'' to support the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan. As for a meeting, he said, `` I'd like to feel that ... it would be constructive, that we'd have something positive to talk about.'' Under the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, talks between the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are supposed to set the stage for an election on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The Palestinians elected in the territories would negotiate five years of limited self-rule with the Israeli government. `` There is still much to do and many details to be worked out before it would be possible to put together a pre-election dialogue,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` For now, we look forward to receiving an Egyptian response.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s role is to convey the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Without PLO acquiescence, Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> are unlikely to participate in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan was `` a very positive step ... a clear step forward.'' But <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said after the Cabinet action that without the assurances `` we will not enter into these talks.'' The Israeli demands include exclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and all of its members from the deliberations. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials did not close the door on the Israeli demands. Referring to them as `` assumptions,'' he said: `` We know that both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are likely to request certain clarifications or understandings about the process. We have made clear to both sides that we're prepared to discuss these issues.''

 WASH: follow up, sir?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 A: Follow up? I do n't know. This line? Do you want to take -- Q: This is an invitation, sir, to ask your opinion of former presidents being paid by private industry once they're out of office. A: I have no problem with that, provided it's not overdone. Q: I'd like to return to. ... A: Everybody's got to make a living. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for a minute. On Sunday, the Vice President said that the Soviets retain expansionistic attitudes in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and several other parts of the world. He suggested that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was a Stalinist, and also suggested that the Soviet defense budget is growing while ours is declining. Do you agree with those three assessments? A: That their defense budget is growing, yeah. Q: And that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. ... A: I'd like to see them find a way to reverse that. And out of the challenge that lies ahead to both <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me, perhaps there will be a way to reverse it. One way to do that, I think, is through prudent arms control. The best way to do it is to do it through success in the <ORGANIZATION> Conventional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> talks, the <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> talks, because that's where _ that's dollar-intensive or ruble-intensive, if you will. Q: The other two points, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? A: What were they? Q: That the Soviets are expansionist in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and other parts of the world, and this is a problem in our improving relations with the Soviets. A: Well, I've long been concerned _ and as I think I said when I announced the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meeting _ concerned about some of these regional issues. And I think we'll have a real opportunity to discuss the Soviet role in, you know, aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the one country _ well, not the one, but one of the few that's swimming against the democratic tide here. And it does not help US-Soviet relations to have enormous expenditures supporting a dictatorship, the Sandinista dictatorship. So, I think there's plenty of room for discussion there. And I look forward to talking to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader, just as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did. But now we know it's a little clearer, the election process coming forward, and I want to see the election process succeed. Q: Well, my question goes. ... A: Where are your questions going? -LRB- Scattered laughter. -RRB- Q: Is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continuing to be expansionist around the world? A: Well, I've told you, I've got concerns about certain areas, just as they've raised concerns with us on certain things. Yes, I'm concerned about continued support of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons _ or <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> support _ I want to be careful because the question of weapons is slightly complicated by how they get there and whether they're coming out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and have long been in Cuban I mean there are some problems there. But I think _ look _ to suggest the contrawise of that and that there are no problems that exist between us, that everything is hunky-dory, simply is not reality, and that's one of the reasons I'm looking forward to this visit. Yes? Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, when you're bobbing around in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> next month, if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should ask you to show forbearance in the event he cracks down domestically or in the event he feels it necessary to support a crackdown in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, how will you respond? A: I'm not going to buy into that hypothetical question. Yes? Q: Mr. President, you've had a report yesterday on the POW @ MIA issue. I wonder if you can give us some specifics about what General <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> is accomplishing over there with regard to remains coming back and when, how many more, when we'll see them. And also, is there any information at all about people alive over there? A: No information at all about that. A new openness, according to General <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, on the part of the Vietnamese leaders, a new spirit, a stepped-up spirit of cooperation in terms of accounting for remains. They're pointing out to him that they are confident that there are no government holding facilities for remains that maybe had existed in the past, pointing out to him that some families, even, might be holding remains, some, you know, individuals in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, hoping for some sort of gain if people are sending _ putting bounty on these things or rewards out there. And _ but I think the bottom line is he felt a _ he was quite encouraging about the kind of cooperation he was receiving. He also relayed to me what I think all of us know, that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> keeps sending signals that they want improved relations. MORE

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told today that jailing a parent for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of a child who may be abused or even dead is a necessary penalty to enforce society's duty to protect defenseless children. `` Where will we be if the state can not enforce'' such orders, asked Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` Will the most effective remedy -LRB- for assuring children's safety -RRB- be taken away?'' The court, in the case of a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman jailed for refusing to say where her son is, engaged in a spirited one-hour discussion of the rights of children and constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>, in jail for more than 18 months for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts, is not being denied her rights against self-incrimination protected by the Fifth Amendment. Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfare could hamstring juvenile courts, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. `` She has never claimed she can not comply with the order, but that she need not comply,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. `` That is a dangerous extension of the Fifth Amendment.'' But <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, said the authorities have another alternative to jailing the parent indefinitely for contempt of court. She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a three-year prison term, he said. `` It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` It's not a matter of ` we ca n't do it. We just wo n't do it'.'' Child welfare groups and numerous state and local officials joined in urging the court to uphold <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s indefinite jailing. The mother's `` interest in avoiding any possibility of self-incrimination simply does not outweigh the state's interest and its obligation to protect'' the child, said a coalition of groups representing gorvernors, mayors and other officials. The groups include the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Social workers last saw <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>, in September 1987 when he was 11 months old. They fear he may be dead. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> was admitted to a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> hospital on Jan. 23, 1987, when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and other injuries. Suspecting the infant had been abused, social workers put <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> in foster care and later obtained a court order giving the city protective custody of him. City officials said <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> suffered from emotional problems and was observed throwing <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> into his crib during the infant's hospitalization <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987, after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo training in parenting skills. But nine months later, the social workers said <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> no longer was cooperating with them. Moreover, they said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>'s father recently had been shot to death and <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> was using drugs The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28, 1988, after she refused to disclose <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>'s whereabouts. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in December that jailing her for refusing to disclose the information violates her constitutional protection against self-incrimination. But Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> suspended the effect of that ruling and prevented her from going free while the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the case. Some have compared the <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> case to that of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who was released from prison on Sept. 25. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, doctor was behind bars for more than two years for refusing to let her daughter visit the girl's father, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s former husband. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, for court-ordered visits with the father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> accused her former husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently has denied. Among other groups supporting the contempt order against <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> are Advocates for Children and Youth, the <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>, 88-1182.

 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops today said no <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> can responsibly take a pro-choice stand on abortion, and they urged public officials to fight abortion. The resolution was approved overwhelmingly on the second day of the fall meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. The 300 leaders of the nation's 53 million Roman Catholics also elected Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> as president. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, like his predecessor, Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, is a social and theological moderate. The resolution on abortion said Catholics should give `` urgent attention and priority'' to the issue in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July giving states more authority to regulate the procedure. An overwhelming number rose from their seats when those in favor of the resolution were asked to stand. In a break from the usual practice, however, there was no request for a showing of those opposed to the resolution. `` No Catholic can responsibly take a ` pro-choice' stand when the `` choice' involves the taking of innocent human life,'' the resolution said. `` We urge public officials, especially Catholics, to advance these goals in recognition of their moral responsibility to protect the weak and defenseless among us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, provoked pro-choice advocates to intensify `` efforts to defeat politicians who do not support permissive abortion,'' the bishops' statement said. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, vice president of the conference since 1986, was elected on the first ballot to succeed Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, also considered a moderate. Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was elected vice president. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> enjoys support among both the liberal and conservative camps of the bishops' conference. On Monday, the leaders of the church opened their meeting by plunging into the abortion debate and urging their flock to dig a little deeper to support church programs. May issued a rallying cry against abortion in his opening address, calling it an issue `` where clear-cut moral principle stands tall above all else'' and comparing abortion to dropping a 6-month-old child in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The leader of a Catholic abortion rights groups called May's remarks `` simply cruel and unusual punishment'' to all women who have abortions, but said she was not surprised by the bishops' renewed vigor on `` I think this meeting marks their re-emergence as a political force on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON>, president of Catholics for a Free Choice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bishops today also were to vote on a proposal to have laymen lead Sunday services without priests. The measure was prompted by a severe shortage of clergy. In electing <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, the conference held to a tradition in which no vice president who has sought the top spot has been turned down. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said in an interview that the most important social issues facing the church include the `` life issue'' of abortion and euthanasia and economic issues such as Third World debt and the rights of unions. The new conference president also said there is room for flexibility in seeking legislation that does not entirely conform to church teaching. For example, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said if the question was whether he would support tolerating a law allowing abortion for rape and incest victims for the greater good of prohibiting other abortions, `` the answer is probably yes.'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> was appointed auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in 1974 and archbishop in 1982 after Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> left for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. With a study showing Catholics contribute 40 percent less of their income than members of other churches, the bishops on Monday also ordered work to begin on a pastoral letter on church giving.

 A man who was a conscientious objector in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War has gone to jail in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rather than serve his adopted country as a soldier in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON> joined a small but growing number of Israelis who refuse to serve in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where a Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began 23 months ago. `` We have been watching the uprising, on television and on the streets, and he has been upset at what he has seen,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Noga </PERSON> <PERSON> Treves </PERSON> <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON>. `` When he came to the point where he could n't stand seeing the way Palestinians are being mistreated, it was natural that he did n't want to take part in this.'' Langfur, 48, was sent to a military prison Nov. 1 to serve 21 days, an army spokesman said. He would not discuss specifics of the case and refused to permit an interview with <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON>. According to the army, 72 men have been jailed for refusing duty in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A support group for them, called Yesh Gvul, puts the total at 91. `` We believe it is on the increase,'' said <PERSON> Yesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gvul </PERSON> director <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidron </PERSON>. `` The army is very embarrassed by this, of course, and seems to be responding with a crackdown.'' <PERSON> Kidron </PERSON> said Yesh Gvul, Hebrew for `` there is a limit,'' has found the army giving repeated sentences to men who refuse duty in the occupied territories. He said one had spent more than 100 days in jail. The army spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said the number refusing is very small compared with those who willingly serve in the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` There have always been a few who refuse orders, even when there is no war, and we have a judicial system to deal with them,'' he said. Newspapers say many reservists, instead of refusing service in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, avoid it by making arrangements for other assignments. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said thousands had used that means. Israeli soldiers or settlers have killed at least 612 Palestinians since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and 142 have been killed by other Palestinians, most of them on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died. The regular army of 130,000 is supplemented by 310,000 reservists, like <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON>, who are called up each year for about 40 days of active duty. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s last war, the invasion and occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982-85, about 160 soldiers were jailed for refusing service in the neighboring country. <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON>'s decision was `` a natural outgrowth of his moral beliefs,'' his wife said. He was born in <LOCATION> Cedarhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, earned a doctorate in philosophy from <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and taught at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. In the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, he won conscientious objector status `` on moral grounds,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON> said. After moving to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979, <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON> worked as a tour guide to support his family, which now includes a daughter, <PERSON> Tali </PERSON>, 11, and son, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, 9. `` He studied the history of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closely and caught the sense of the miracle of the creation of the state,'' his wife said. `` He still has this feeling.'' Like most immigrants, <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON> completed military training and has done reserve duty within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He was not called to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and when orders came last month for duty in the territories, he refused. `` He feels, and I feel, that there's no way to peace but to come to some kind of terms with the Palestinians,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Langfur </PERSON> said. `` The way it is now ca n't go on.''

 Voters were given an unprecedented choice between two black candidates Tuesday in an election to pick a successor to popular Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>. The two hopefuls, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and his youthful former aide, state Sen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, fought a bruising campaign that was notable as much for its nastiness as its historical significance. Forbes accused White of being a slumlord and of beating two former wives, while <PERSON> White </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> as a `` master of sleaze.'' The non-partisan race between the two Democrats was made possible when <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> decided to step aside to seek the 1990 Republican nomination for governor. <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> were among the other <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cities choosing mayors Tuesday.

 <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s first black mayor was <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, who won office in 1967. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, who served one term and subsequently became a municipal judge, briefly considered running for mayor this year. He did n't, and <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and <PERSON> White </PERSON> finished first and second in an Oct. 3 primary that included three white candidates. In a city nearly evenly split between whites and blacks, the two focused much of their campaigning on the city's predominantly white west side. The five-week campaign epitomized <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s bare-knuckle style of politics. White, 38, who has been married three times, defended himself against allegations by his first two wives that he beat them. He also was put on the defensive when 200 city code violations were found in seven houses he owned. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, 59, defended himself against charges of ethical conflicts involving his City Hall duties and his private law practice, and brushed aside allegations that police and other city workers were defying the city charter by becoming personally involved in the campaign on his behalf.

A: I do n't know exactly when they learned about it. Q: Early on? July? A: No. Q: October? A: No. Not in July. Q: Why did you keep it from us? A: Well, I've already explained why I did it the way I did, and. ... Q: Did you feel they could n't be trusted. ... A: No. Q: ... to keep it secret?

What are you going to do differently? A: To do what? Q: To pursue your initiatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, your domestic initiatives that. ... A: Try to urge you people to urge them _ join me in urging, calling out for congressional action _ a plea to move forward with the Clean Air Act, and the drug program, and the ethics legislation; editorial pounding to get them to do what they ought to do _ support the president as he tries to move this country forward in these areas _ and not let them dominate debate by blocking everything I try to do.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is returning $ 567 million in frozen assets to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a move President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he hopes will prompt <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to push for freedom for American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But administration officials maintained that the transfer of money, which has been held for nearly a decade, was unrelated to the plight of the hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Moslems. The $ 567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by American banks against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most of those claims were settled in the past few weeks. As a result, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Monday night, the leftover assets will be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>. An additional $ 243 million will be transferred to a special fund to back up other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> claims against the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking at a morning news conference, said he did n't know what effect the money transfer would have on officials in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But, he added: `` I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold these hostages.'' He said he carries `` the fate of the hostages with me every single day.'' Referring to financial claims and counter-claims between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the president said: `` I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out now.'' While <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has made some `` positive statements'' recently, he said the administration has so far run into `` dead ends'' in working behind the scenes to free the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he also believes `` the time has come for the Iranian assets to be unfrozen.'' `` I do n't think we ought to be fearful,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told reporters during a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, at the Capitol. `` It might lead ultimately to flexibility on the hostages,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. On a related issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condemned supporters of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Christian general who is opposed to a peace plan for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ironed out by Moslems and Christians in the war-torn country. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s backers harrassed the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch who backed the plan. `` I am deeply offended by the <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters who tried to humiliate the patriarch yesterday,'' the president said. ` I just hope that before I leave this job that I can in some way contribute to the question of peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The move on the Iranian assets followed talks in The Hague last week between <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser, and Iranian officials. A special tribunal set up in the Dutch capital in 1981 has been considering conflicting claims. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the decision to return the assets through the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> was unrelated to the eight Americans being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by a pro-Iranian faction. Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> offered help last month in getting 18 Western hostages freed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> released billions of dollars in frozen assets or helped settle the cases of three Iranians captured by Christian Lebanese militiamen in 1982. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials immediately responded they would not engage in negotiations over the hostages and called on humanitarian grounds for the release of all the hostages. <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>'s talks with Iranian officials in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION> last Thursday and Friday concerned only claims matters `` We are making no deals with anyone about the hostages,'' she said. About $ 800 million had been held in a special fund against claims of American banks. `` Since most of the bank claims were settled over the last several months, $ 567 million could be returned to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the remainder was transferred to a special security account to back up other claims,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. That account is maintained at a minimum of $ 500 million, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of the arrangement that led to the release of American hostages held for 444 days in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> by militants. There are several other claims issues outstanding, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s demand for compensation for military equipment purchased before the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> transferred $ 9.9 billion in frozen assets to the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks' settlement, some $ 3.8 billion had been transferred to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The $ 810 million involved in Monday's action had been reserved for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 The election marked the second time Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, 43, faced a former mayor. In 1985, she trounced <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, whose mayoral longevity record she is trying to match. In her most recent election two years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> _ an accountant by trade and the first woman elected in a citywide race when she won the controller's job in 1978 _ won her fourth two-year term against token opposition. <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>'s father was colorful <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>, the prime mover behind building of the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Astrodome. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>, a 51-year-old lawyer, engaged in numerous debates throughout the campaign, with <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON> charging that the incumbent had become complacent in office, lost track of federal money, rewarded supporters with city contracts and lost the support of the police department. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> accused her opponent of mudslinging and criticized his record as mayor. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> took office at the height of the oil boom, but then had to deal with declining revenues and a shattered economy when oil prices collapsed. She touted her handling of city finances through the tough times and boasted that unemployment, which peaked at some 13 percent, is now around 5 percent.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Tuesday. YEAR IN REVIEW On the eve of the first anniversary of his election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` pleased that our administration has come together rapidly with good people and with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose.'' Internationally, he said that `` important decisions have been made for freedom and we've supported those movements.'' Domestically, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was more convinced than ever `` that we can ... give hope to the homeless and help to the needy, inspiration to millions of Americans who want to reach out and help their neighbors.'' `` I enjoy it,'' he said of being president. HOSTAGES <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped the decision to return $ 567 million in frozen Iranian assets will get the `` underbrush cleaned out'' and lead eventually to freedom for Americans held hostage by Iranian-backed forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said he hoped Iranian officials `` will do what they can'' to influence the hostage-holders and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` continuing behind the scenes to follow rabbit trails'' in hopes of winning freedom for the hostages. ABORTION Asked about his vetoes of legislation expanding the conditions under which Medicaid funds can finance abortions, he said, `` I have no intention of changing my position. It's so personal. I just come down on the side of life.'' Asked about the emergence of abortion as a major issue in Tuesday's gubernatorial elections in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` People are not for the most part single-issue voters.'' NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING Asked about the role of negative campaign commercials in Tuesday's elections, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a way of sorting out what's fair and what's not fair, what's ugly and what's not ugly. He said he hoped future elections would be `` a little more positive.'' RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` veto and exhort'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until he gets action on his legislative programs and, asking, `` What else can I do?'' blamed Democrat majorities in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for an impasse on reducing the federal deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded Democrats `` have the votes'' to have forced him to pull back his plan to reduce capital-gains taxes but pledged, `` I'll be ready come the fall of 1990.'' EASTERN <LOCATION> EUROPE </LOCATION> Reacted to a comment Monday from ex-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that he was slow in his response to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European pro-democracy movements by challenging critics to produce specific proposals `` other than triple the spending'' to aid those movements. He said he felt that his cautious approach had the support of allied leaders in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that `` I do n't think you can contain now the people's aspirations for freedom by going back to totalitarianism.'' RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not say `` everything is hunky dory'' until he is convinced the Soviet government has reined in its defense budget and expansionist desires. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would raise those issues when he meets with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next month. GLOBAL WARMING The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not joining a call by more than 60 nations for capping carbon monoxide emisisons by the year 2000 because `` this policy of the environment can not be driven by extremes.'' He called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to expedite action on his proposed rewriting of the Clean Air Act. LEBANON <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that followers of Lebanese strongman <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> were `` totally out of order'' in forcing the country's <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> butros <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, to kiss a picture of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> a day after the patriarch endorsed a Moslem-Christian accord opposed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> QUAYLE </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> he would not say if he would seek re-election in 1992 but, if he does, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` my choice'' as his running mate.

 WASHN: question? -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Where did someone else go wrong? We've been trying to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion. I do n't think _ I do n't _ I'm _ look, if I make a big mistake, I'll admit it But I do n't think so when it comes to the approach to the budget. We've got some honest differences on some things, and maybe with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, there's an honest difference on capital gains, for example. But we put that in our budget proposal. It was in there with a certain revenue figure next to it. I do n't think I `` went wrong.'' That's my responsibility. Here's what I believe. And I think that there has been a little bit of a partisan shift that occurred up there. When you hear them all come out with a rather unflattering word on the same day to describe my leadership, you begin to wonder _ including the national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ you begin to wonder what goes awry. But let's leave aside the politics. I'll be ready, come the fall of 1990, and let's move the legislative process forward. Q: This was supposed to be groundwork for cooperation next year's budget, which was going to be the real tough one. Have we lost all hope of that now? A: Well, I think a lot on'91 depends on what happens, you know, in the last few days here; what kinds of decisions are made. Q: Staying on the budget for a minute, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> feels it ca n't live with the consequences of a sequester apparently, and you've issued a statement last week saying that you're prepared to manage the government under those circumstances. As a person who campaigned as a candidate who would defend the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and keep defenses strong, how do you explain this to the people who supported you on the basis of. ... A: I tell them please get in touch with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and do what we suggested back there when we had that _ those meetings. Please help us keep the defenses of this country strong, but if the _ if that is frustrated by the inability to get an acceptable reconciliation bill, I have no choice, and I think the Pentagon leaders understand that. We _ <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has done a superb job. He has fought with diminishing resources for a sound Pentagon budget. And it troubles me to have <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> insensitive, and also to add in _ I mean, it's tough _ look, I know it's tough to cut systems But you go to cut them, and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> makes some very tough decisions backed by the president, and then the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trades around and adds them back in. And so it's a question of, you know, staying with what we find is the priority for this defense program and trying to stay with it. But, I've got to live with the system also. Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, in the back. Q: Are you willing to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> when he comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? A: Uhhh, whether he's coming or not, I'm not sure. Certainly willing to consider it. And he is giving _ I think there's a real effort now to work out support for the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> points _ the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposals _ and I'd like to feel that a meeting would be held and that it would be constructive, that we'd have something positive to talk about. Yes? Q: Mr. President _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, last week, you said in response to the Nicaraguan decision to end the cease-fire, that you would keep your options open. And yet, the best headcounters _ in fact, most of the worst headcounters on the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ all say you do n't have the option of new military aid to the Contras. So, is n't that, in effect, a meaningless statement A: Well, I'll tell you _ no, because I think one option now is to encourage in every way we can these talks that will result in a cease-fire. I worry about what <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has done. The only good thing about it _ everybody sees that he is _ he is swimming against the tide, and I think that it's much clearer to some who, in our hemisphere, who are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. But, I'm not going to give up on hoping that they can get back to the status quo ante here. Q: But, you do n't believe, sir, that you still have the option of renewing military aid to the Contras, do you? MORE

<HEAD>Banned Films From 1960s to be Shown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All films made in the 1960s and banned after Soviet tanks crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968 will be shown in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Tuesday. Government cultural officials were quick to add, however, that the decision was not meant to rehabilitate the liberalization period. The decision to ban the films `` was motivated especially by the needs of -LRB- political -RRB- consolidation after the years of crisis in 1968-69,'' the party daily Rude Pravo said. `` This decision, however, does not mean any kind of reversal in our distribution policy, reappraisal of historical events or the films themselves,'' Rude Pravo said. During the 196Os, `` the Czech wave'' of young filmmakers represented by <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Menzel </PERSON> swept <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, winning two Oscars for `` Closely Observed Trains'' and `` Shop On Main Street.'' After the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968, <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> decided to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he scored successes with `` One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'' and `` Amadeus.'' <PERSON> Menzel </PERSON> fought a long battle with authorities at home. `` This move is certainly a positive one, albeit a little bit belated,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Foll </PERSON>, a film historian and member of a commission which managed to lift the ban this summer. `` This ... leaves the drawers clean, there are no films banned anymore,'' said <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Humplik </PERSON> of the Czechoslovak Film Distributing Agency. To many moviegoers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the 1960s still represent `` the golden era'' of arts and culture. Film production has been received with much less enthusiasm in the last 20 years. Eleven of the old films will be shown in general distribution, while 13 others will be shown in film clubs throughout the country, the daily said. Among them will be `` The Party And The Guests'' directed by <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON> and featuring <PERSON> Zdena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salivarova </PERSON> and writer <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Skvorecky </PERSON>. The decision `` will make it possible for a better and more objective determining of values inside and outside the times, will strip them of the smell of cheap sensation and myth, while contributing to an objective view on the rich and complex period of the sixties in our film,'' said <PERSON> Hviezdoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 City Councilman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, seeking to become <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, faced City Attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> on Tuesday in an election dominated by an anti-busing school initiative. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> helped draft Initiative 34, dubbed `` Save Our Schools'' by supporters, and made it the prime vehicle of his campaign to become <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s first Republican elected mayor in 24 years. Also on the ballot in municipal elections around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state were races between <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strege </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vialle </PERSON> for mayor of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> mayor.

 <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s anti-busing measure went from a commanding lead in early polls to a 50-50 proposition a week before the election under a fierce attack from city, state and school officials in this city of 500,000. The initiative asked but did not require the independently elected and self-budgeting city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to halt mandatory busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $ 4.3 million to $ 4.5 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for `` magnet'' programs to attract a racial balance in school enrollment. In the officially nonpartisan contest to succeed Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> trumpeted his Democratic party credentials, including endorsements from <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> and virtually all of the city's state legislators. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, a maverick moderate who briefly supported former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for president in 1980 and once tried to form a third political party, downplayed his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> affiliation. The two were allies in their first political forays, with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> supporting <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> for election as the city's chief legal officer in 1977 and <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> supporting <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> for one of the nine <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> seats the next year. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, who did not seek re-election to a fourth term, has accepted a job as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Congressional inaction on a bill raising the federal debt ceiling threatens the government with default on Thursday for the first time in its history. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said after closed-door meetings on Monday that leaders are hoping to pass a new debt ceiling in time for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign it on Wednesday `` We have decided to concentrate on extension of the debt ceiling while we are looking at other issues,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said after leaders tried to break the deadlock that has blocked passage of the higher debt ceiling and a big deficit-reduction bill. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is prepared to let automatic spending cuts triggered Oct. 16 remain in effect unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves a deficit-reduction bill to his liking. The automatic-cuts processs `` is not easy but its real deficit reduction,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would sign an unamended bill that produces deficit reduction in the $ 14 billion range, which is considerably more than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and he agreed on last spring. `` If it's all loaded up with a lot of special projects, I wo n't sign it,'' he vowed. The president said he is not about to give up on his cherished capital-gains tax cut, which is stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over the threat of a Democratic filibuster. `` The votes are there. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed it. A majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants it,'' he said. One effect of the stalemate over the debt limit came Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> postponed its weekly bill auction. Then, today, it announced the postponement of $ 40 billion in debt auctions this week. `` The postponement of these auctions is necessary because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory debt limit ... `` the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said. The latest postponment involved auctions of $ 10 billion in three-year notes today, $ 10 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> planned to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> had planned to offer $ 16 billion in three - and six-month bills Monday, but postponed the sale `` because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory debt limit. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> lost further borrowing authority Oct. 31 when the debt limit reverted from $ 2.87 trillion to $ 2.8 trillion. Because it already has reached the lower limit, the government faces default on some of its debt as early as Thursday. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said last week that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to increase the limit by Tuesday, `` the government will run out of cash and default on Nov. 9'' when about $ 13.8 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills mature. `` Each day that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to act, however, will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in a speech to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bankers. `` To avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default, immediate congressional action is imperative.'' Disagreement over several issues are holding up the legislation. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> indicated one major issue to be resolved is whether legislation repealing or scaling back catastrophic health coverage for retirees should be attached to the debt-ceiling bill or considered as part of the deficit-reduction package. The House has passed a $ 3.1 trillion debt ceiling, but action was stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Republican demands that it be accompanied by a capital gains tax cut, a top priority for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The White House abandoned that effort last week and Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders were discussing legislation Monday to increase the limit. However, any bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> likely would differ from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version and efforts to reach a compromise would require more time. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Basham </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, told reporters last week that plans for $ 40 billion in additional borrowing this week probably would have to be postponed if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't complete action on a new debt limit by Tuesday. These auctions include $ 10 billion in three-year notes Tuesday, $ 10 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills Thursday. Lack of congressional action forced the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday to suspend new sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds and of special securities for state and local governments.

<HEAD>Integrated Curriculum Could Recruit More Teachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that institutions of higher education can help alleviate a shortage of qualified teachers by more aggressively attracting undergraduates to the profession. `` Few institutions are trying seriously to recruit large numbers of more able students into teaching or provide them with more challenging and substantive programs,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, association vice president for programs. More liberal arts majors could be recruited if colleges and universities combined undergraduate arts and science programs with education courses, the association said. Education courses also should be added to the general-education curriculum, which is usually taken in the first two years of college before the student declares a major, the group said. By adding an education course, colleges and universities might recruit students who have not seriously considered teaching, or who even have `` some aversion'' to it. Integrating non-education courses with education training will produce `` bright, broadly educated'' graduates with `` command both of the subjects to be taught and of the ways in which they can be taught effectively,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. The suggestions in the association study, `` Those Who Can: Undergraduate Programs to Prepare Arts and Sciences Majors for Teaching,'' differ from two influential 1986 studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Teaching as a Profession and by the <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The earlier studies recommended prospective teachers be required to earn an undergraduate degree in an academic discipline before undertaking professional training at the graduate level. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> predicts the demand for new public school teachers will rise from 128,000 in 1988 to 174,000 in 1995. Only 8.8 percent of the 1988 first-year students plan to pursue careers in elementary or secondary schools. As recently as 1980, 34 percent of new college graduates who were certified to teach had completed baccalaureate degrees in the arts and sciences. By 1984, that number had fallen to 19 percent, the report said. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said the association's report, supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, is the result of a three-year study that included a national survey of four-year institutions with teacher-certification programs for arts and sciences majors.

 WASHN: do you? A: Uhh, it would be extremely difficult to get the money, if that's what you're saying, yeah. Yes? Q: Mr. President, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says that you went to see her and said you agreed that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> should leave as chief of staff, but that when she asked you to go to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, you said that was not your role. Number one, is that the way you remember it? And number two, now that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is vice president, if he thought there was someone who was not serving you well, do you agree that it's not his role to come and tell you that A: No, I think it's his role to tell me anything that's on his mind, which is exactly the relationship I had with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and that's the way I worked as vice president. Q: Mr. President, could you just answer the. ... A: No, I ca n't help you on that. I do n't want to get into that one _ -LRB- laughter -RRB-. -LRB- Laughs -RRB- What was the next question, why? Never mind. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, given that today is Election Day, I wonder if you're satisfied with the level of political discourse you see, if you think that this negativism that's being raised in one campaign after another is excessive, and if you feel you can do anything about it yourself, given that your last campaign was quite negative or critical, if you prefer that word? A: I think everybody would prefer the positives. What some consider negative, others consider factual. So, you always have a judgmental problem there. But, I'm not sure there is much that a president can do about it in terms of _ I do n't want to inhibit a candidate from taking his case to the people or her case to the people in any way he or she sees fit. On the other hand, I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a way of sorting out what's fair and what's not fair, what's ugly and what is n't ugly. And I have great confidence in that, that they're right this election day a year ago. I think they sorted through some of these allegations that this was the ugliest, dirtiest campaign, and I think they voted on a more positive basis than that. Q: Mr. President, how _ coming off of <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>'s question, though _ how do you respond to those who suggest that the negative campaigning that started earlier in this campaign than usual is a legacy of'88, when it was shown to be successful? A: Well, I do n't say anything started in 1988 that had n't been taking place in'86 or'84 or'82 or'80 or so _ you know _ and if you look into history, you're going to have certain things that are considered negative. I do n't have to stand here and defend the campaign of 1988. I'd be perfectly prepared to do it, but I was elected. I put confidence in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, their ability to sort through what is fair and what is unfair, what is ugly and what is unugly. And be as positive as possible, but while people were running around, you know, in campaigns talking about _ talking about ads this year _ the candidates have been out there taking their case on various _ various issues out there. So, I _ I think we're _ I think there's a little bit of a Beltway syndrome here in terms of this intense focus on negativism. And, yet, if their trend is that way, maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets a little more positive. Q: How would you do that? A: Well, say I think it ought to be a little more positive. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. I mean, what else can you do? I'm certainly not going to legislate it, and certainly not going to try to dictate to a candidate how he or she, you know, reacts in a certain situation. But, there will be _ I suppose there'll be a lot of interpretation on one candidate or another, and we'll all go back to whether there needs some other way to approach this. But when you get right down to it, I do not want to see legislation try to get into this question. It gets into a censorship mode that I just would feel very uncomfortable with. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, and then I've got to go. MORE

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an election-anniversary news conference, claimed a successful start for his presidency on Tuesday and voiced hope that the return of $ 567 million in frozen assets to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will eventually help lead to freedom for American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The president said he would `` veto and exhort'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until he gets action on his legislative programs, exclaiming, `` What else can I do?'' as he blamed Democrat majorities in both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for an impasse on reduing the federal deficit. Much of the session revolved around complicated foreign policy matters as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed criticism _ most recently from former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ of his policies toward eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the administration is dealing properly with the tumultuous changes there, and that his opponents just want to spend more money on aid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the podium after ending the televised news conference to rebuke militant Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for grabbing a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch at his home and manhandling him for endorsing a compromise political accord. He said that behavior was `` totally out of order'' and urged that all foreign forces be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and warring factors be reconciled. The president said the release of Iranian funds might get `` underbrush cleaned out.'' `` I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. He said he knew of no reason to be encouraged at this time, however, on an issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and complicated the first 10 months of his term. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived with a statement marking Wednesday's anniversary of his election and saying `` we've had so far a successful first year in office.'' `` I enjoy it; I like the challenge,'' he said of his 10 months in office. Later, in response to a question about today's off-year elections, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped future campaigns would be `` a little more postive.'' Asked about the emergence of abortion as a critical issue in gubernatorial elections being held in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asserted `` that issue ranks about 9th to 14th.'' `` People are not for the most part single-issue voters,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of an issue that often seemed to cut against Republicans during the campaign period. He added, `` I have no intention of changing my position. It's so personal. I just come down on the side of life.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision expanding the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. `` It supports compulsory abortion,'' he said. `` I am not going to do that.'' Currently, such funds can be used only if the mother's life is in danger. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected criticism that he has failed to exert leadership in wordwide efforts to combat global warming. He said he was not prepared to join some 60 nations meeting in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on a resolution to cap carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 saying such a move is too early and too extreme.

 Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who lost the closest governor's race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> history eight years ago, entered Tuesday's election confident he would reverse his fortunes and beat Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> in an unusually nasty contest. Election officials said voter turnout around the state ranged from moderate to heavy, and was especially strong in <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s home district of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. The race to succeed Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s first and <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s third In the final weekend, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, an eight-term congressman, held a 24-point lead in an independent poll that gave him a better than 2-to-1 advantage among independent voters. As he grew increasingly confident of his lead, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> devoted most of his campaign stops to key Assembly districts where close battles were waged for control of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s 80-member lower house, where the Republicans held a 41-39 margin. At stake was control of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> which will control redrawing congressional districts after the 1990 census.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, 52, ran fourth in the 1977 Democratic primary, and lost the 1981 general election to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.3 million cast, a margin of less than one-twelfth of 1 percent. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> is barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term. Political observers said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> softened a brusque and aloof personality that hurt him in 1981, and ran a nearly flawless campaign that kept <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> on the defensive. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, 48, appeared troubled by internal disarray and stumbled on delicate issues, such as abortion and homosexual rights. Abortion entered the campaign after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July gave states more power to restrict abortions. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who once opposed abortion, immediately condemned the erosion of abortion rights. It took <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> weeks to remold his long-held anti-abortion stand and assure <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s largely pro-choice electorate that he would not impose his personal views on voters. Each gubernatorial candidate spent $ 5 million, the maximum permitted under the state's public financing law. Most was spent on television commercials in the costly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> markets as the candidates exchanged charges over the environment, corruption and taxes. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, and then <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, accused each other of repeatedly lying on the campaign trail. Both ran commercials showing their opponent's nose growing like that of Pinocchio. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who wrote the federal Superfund cleanup law, repeatedly attacked <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s environmental record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to cut premiums by deregulating the insurance industry to increase competition. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> called for changes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s death penalty law and promised to fight for tough laws to combat illegal drugs. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said the current capital punishment law was adequate.

 WASHN: to go. Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s public comments about his meetings with Chinese leaders seem to imply that the Chinese believe that now it's time for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to act if we want better relations with the Chinese. Was there anything that the former president told you in private that encourages you, thinking that relations with the Chinese will improve? And anything we can do? A: The Chinese have a slogan, `` He who ties the knot should untie it.'' The Chinese still feel that we tied the knot and thus should untie it. I do n't feel that way. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was very helpful because he was an unofficial visitor; he is respected in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a `` lao pengyou,'' old friend; he is the man who opened a relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when things were extraordinarily difficult; not just a lack of communication, but go back to history and take a look at the _ you were in the last vestiges of the Cultural Revolution where, you know, many, many, many people, hundreds of thousands reportedly lost their lives. And so he went there at a difficult time. He saw the fundamental importance of this relationship, as I do. He could speak quite frankly to the Chinese leaders, and they, in turn, spoke very frankly to him. And I think he made the point that we did n't tie the knot. Now, I think that helps. Because of the respect that the leaders in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have for President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, I think that visit was very constructive. He carried no messages from me, he was not on a, you know, semi-official mode or anything _ a mission or anything of that nature. But I think I have a better feeling of where Chinese leaders stand at this point because of having been debriefed by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. I wish there were some positive steps that I could suggest to them that they take. There are some things, that I will keep private, that I have quietly recommended. And we'll see where it goes. But this relationship is important to us. As those of you who know my views on this question, I have never favored the concept of a `` card'' _ playing a Soviet card, playing a Chinese card. The relationship has to stand on its merits. Having said that, there is enormous geo-political reasons for us to have relations with the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. And yet, there is this affr convening those Taif meetings, and for the legislators _ to the legislators that are _ that attended _ the courage that they showed in going there. And the quest for freedom _ I mean, the quest for peace _ in that country was so _ you just feel it in what those legislators are hoping to accomplish. And then along comes these followers that I would term totally out of order in going in there and trying to humiliate the Maronite patriarch, and it is just totally counter-productive. And I _ I hope that we can find a way to build on the new election, build on _ and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> willingness to get out, move those troops out.

 Space shuttle Discovery will lift off after dark on a secret Thanksgiving week military mission, the first of three dazzling nighttime launches scheduled here in four weeks. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced the Nov. 20 Discovery launch date Tuesday after shuttle managers concluded a two day-review that assessed the readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the global tracking network and all other aspects of the mission. The space agency said the liftoff would occur during a four-hour period starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night launch in 32 shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public until nine minutes before launch to make it harder for Soviet reconnaissance ships to track the shuttle. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> also announced Tuesday that it will launch the first commercial payloads on its huge Titan 3 rocket on the night of Dec. 8. They will be communications satellites for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> earlier announced the scheduled after-dark launch of space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Dec. 18, to deploy a communications satellite and to track down and return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> a science satellite that has been in orbit more than five years. The late Discovery and Titan launches are necessary to place the satellites in desired orbits. The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> liftoff is timed to put the shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved. While Discovery's crew is scheduled to be in space on Thanksgiving, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-day mission will have its astronauts in orbit on Christmas. The trio of night launches should provide a brilliant fireworks display for rocket watchers for hundreds of miles around. When Atlantis lifted off on the last shuttle night mission in November, 1985, its 700-tail of fire was clearly visible from <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, 150 miles away on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southwest coast. Discovery's payload on the Nov. 20 flight will be a $ 300 million, 2 -LCB- - ton satellite for monitoring Soviet missile tests and eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications, said reliable sources who requested anonymity Another team of Discovery astronauts launched a similar satellite in 1985. The crew for the upcoming mission is: <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, the commander; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, the pilot; and mission specialists <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>.

 The East German <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> resigned today amid growing calls within the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ranks for reform and a change in leadership. The entire 44-man Cabinet stepped down, spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. The government will remain in office until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elects a new council of ministers. He did not say when that would be. The Cabinet, led by Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, has little real power of its own but implements policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Poliburo, which also was under pressure to step down. The Politburo met today to discuss ways of stopping the exodus of East Germans to the West. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was to meet Wednesday to consider further changes aimed at stopping the exodus. About 5,000 people marched in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to protest election fraud and call for free elections, and leaflets passed out called for more protests. A parliamentary committee rejected a proposed travel law that would have allowed East Germans to travel in the West for 30 days a year, saying it did not go far enough. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>, organ of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> organization, said today leaders `` should resign without any delay'' to make way for a new Politburo and a new Cabinet that will implement reforms <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s Communist Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> also urged the resignations, as did a member of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s Communist city government, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knupp </PERSON>, and three small parties that have been allied with the Communists. The Politburo normally has 21 members, but two lost their jobs Oct. 18 and the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, has said five others will be replaced this week. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources said today they expect the reform-minded <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party chief, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, to be elected to the Politburo. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> has been mentioned as a possible new premier, replacing <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>. Despite <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s promises of change, East Germans continued to pour into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and were arriving today at a rate of about 120 an hour. West German federal border police said 28,000 refugees had arrived by late this morning in the latest surge, which began early Saturday when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders began allowing free exit via <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Horndasch </PERSON> said the East Germans were being taken to 56 temporary shelters nationwide. About 500,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday night in what has become a weekly ritual, and more than 200,000 others took part in street protests in at least six other cities. The marchers demanded free elections and the legalization of opposition groups, challenging the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political monopoly. They also ridiculed a draft of the proposed travel law. Parliament's constitutional committee today said the law `` does not meet the expectations of citizens ... and will not achieve the political credibility of the state,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The committee called for another law that, among other things, would lift the need for exist visas. It also called for an emergency <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session to discuss the tense situation in the country. So far this year, more than 175,000 East Germans _ more than 1 percent of the population of 16.6 million _ have moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by emigrating legally, escaping or failing to return from approved trips abroad. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> gives them automatic citizenship and help in starting new lives. The unexpected decision to let East Germans out through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> created the first free route to the West since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday, protesters shouting `` The Wall must go!'' braved driving rain. Banners demanded `` Free Elections'' and `` Travel Law without Restrictions.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Turek </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> pastor in the southern industrial city of 650,000, said by telephone that about 500,000 people marched. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said members of New Forum, the largest pro-reform group, addressed the crowd. A mammoth rally Saturday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where the crowd was estimated at 1 million, was the largest protest in the country's 40-year history ADN said 70,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> on Monday, 60,000 in <LOCATION> Halle </LOCATION>, 50,000 in <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION>, 25,000 in <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION>, and several thousand each in a several other towns. In <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, the march was authorized by authorities and led by the reform-minded party chief, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, and Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first sanctioned demonstration in the city.

<HEAD>Falwell to Stop Publication of Monthly Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> has decided to stop publication of his monthly <ORGANIZATION> Fundamentalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> with the December issue, a spokesman says. The magazine, started by <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> in 1982, `` did not make money and it's not something that Rev. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> was willing to personally put in the time and energy to make the magazine stand on its own,'' the spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, said. Circulation, paid and unpaid, was about 70,000, he said. He was unable to give a percentage of paid subscribers. A year's subscription, 11 issues, cost $ 14.95 <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said it cost about $ 750,000 a year to publish the magazine. The magazine staff was told of the decision Monday, <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. The five people involved with the magazine probably will be laid off, he said. The Moral Majority, which <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> founded, stopped publishing its monthly newsletter when it was disbanded earlier this year. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> is meeting with other officials this month to discuss the future direction of the ministry, which has been making financial cuts this year, despite what officials say are record revenues approaching $ 135 million. More than 500 jobs have been terminated since January. `` He's asked that his staff evaluate everything we're doing to determine how strategically each operation relates to one of three areas _ <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, Old Time Gospel Hour and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> _ and furthermore, our goal is that everything we do in these three areas have some impact on world evangelization,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Attention focused on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today as voters decided the outcome of campaigns testing attitudes on race and abortion and trying the public's tolerance for negative appeals. As candidates wound down their campaigns Monday the emphasis was on voter turnout, with Democrats warning against over-confidence and Republicans vowing to surprise pollsters who show them trailing. Democrats <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> were hoping to break race barriers _ <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaigning in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to become the first black elected governor of any state and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> bidding to become <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor's race Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> looked like a solid bet to defeat Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>. Turnout was described as moderate to heavy, and especially strong in the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s home district. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and his Republican opponent, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, voted early in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Despite his lead in pre-election polls, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> declined to predict victory when he voted on upper <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. `` I hope we prevail, of course,'' said the Democratic candidate. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he was confident. Election officials said turnout was heavy in all parts of the city, predicting that 60 percent to 65 percent of eligible voters would cast ballots. Early reports from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> pointed to a heavy turnout. `` We're on roller skates,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the voter registrar in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> `` It seems like a tremendous turnout. I think it's going to be a record in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> anyway.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a White House news conference about the potential impact of the abortion issue on today's elections, said: `` People are not for the most part single-issue voters. They care about war and peace, they care about the environment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed suggestions that the negative tone this year is a legacy of his 1988 presidential campaign. `` I do n't have to stand here and defend the campaign of 1988,'' he said, adding that `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a way of sorting out what's fair and what's not fair, what's ugly and what is n't ugly. The president said any role he might have in making campaigns `` a little more positive'' would be limited to persuasion. `` You're certainly not going to legislate it,'' he said Pre-election polls bolstered the Democrats' hopes in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> had an edge over Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> while a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> poll said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had a double-digit lead over Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` Our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` All we have to do is get the vote out.'' `` Turnout is very important,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. `` Every Democratic election here has to depend on turnout and hopefully it will be there.'' While race was n't raised directly in either contest, both <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> complained of a double standard, implying their Democratic opponents were being judged leniently because they are black. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has a history of getting away with things that others do n't get away with,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Monday as he insisted the election had become `` a referendum on integrity.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> took a similar tack in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> last week. Voters also were choosing mayors and city council members in cities large and small, as well as state legislators in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The candidates included long-term incumbents like <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Socialist <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> was favored to win election as mayor of <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, were bidding to become the first black mayors of their cities. There were 56 propositions on ballots in 10 states, giving voters a chance to decide on issues ranging from funding for education in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, whether to build a new ballpark in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, smoking in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and cruise missile testing in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Whichever party claimed the most victories from the sparse off-year lineup was sure to read the results as a harbinger of 1990, although there was no sign of the emergence of any national issue other than abortion, a volatile question whose long-term impact was far from clear. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned for Republican candidates for governor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But pre-election polls gave Democrats hope for a sweep of the three races and the chance to claim voters were rejecting the Republican president along with the candidates he tried to help. The campaigns were markedly nasty in tone with the candidates for governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> calling each other liars and rivals in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> questioning each other's ethics. There was slim hope any conceivable results could undermine candidates' faith in the power of attack commercials. While race was the question that focused attention on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> early in the campaign, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> upset many expectations when he made his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s stand caught <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, an opponent of legal abortions, by surprise. As the campaign progressed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> conceded he was being hurt by the abortion issup 3,874.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Timesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reston </PERSON>, sage of American journalism, says he does n't join those who wring their hands and ask where the giants of yesterday are. He was around, he says, when the giants were <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. He's had enough of giants. <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> does wonder, as he retires, what happened to the idea that people in government were supposed to set the standards, not just shrug off their misdeeds with an `` everbody-does-it.'' He's not surprised that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is turning out to be a cautious president. `` You get from <PERSON> George </PERSON> about what you see,'' he says. `` I know that family. I lived up the street from his mother and father for 10 years. <PERSON> George </PERSON> is not the kind of guy to run a revolution, but he wo n't do anything stupid.'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> does raise an eyebrow over the president's weekend declaration that he would run again with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> if he decides himself to seek re-election. `` If presidents go on choosing people like <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and telling us they're the best available, you're bound to have problems,'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> says. After all, he points out, a country of two or three million `` produced Mr. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. I ca n't believe we're getting anything like the best people in government today.'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> retired Friday, on his 80th birthday, half a century after he joined the Times. He is writing a book of memoirs. He's an old sportswriter, and fond of saying so. He started for the <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, in 1932, for $ 10 a week and was a publicity man for <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1933, a traveling secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> in 1934 and an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> man in, he recalls, a rathole of a bureau in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from 1937 to 1939, when the war was fomenting and the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> hired him away. He spent most of the rest of his life observing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For 34 years, what <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>'s column said was important to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He did his own thinking, took the long view, was generally optimistic. He retired without fanfare, but shared some parting ideas in a telephone interview. He does n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> suffers from a shortage of great men. Rather than a giant, he likes people like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>: `` They knew what they did n't know.'' The presidents `` who have gotten in the most trouble in the last 40 or 50 years are those who thought they could do everything on their own and thought they did n't need a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and could run it out of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> says. `` Look where the giants got us in the world, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. I think we can do without giants. If we just get a lot of pretty smart guys around and argue it out we've got a better chance of coming out all right.'' He would like to see a return to `` the idea that people in government are supposed to be the models who set the standards for personal conduct. That idea has kind of gone by the boards for some reason or other.'' Now, `` they say, ` Well, Everybody does it.''' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> does n't join <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in wishing the 22nd Amendment could be erased from the Constitution. In his last year in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often said he thought it was a mistake to limit presidents to two terms. `` I do n't like the idea of people being in power too long,'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> says. `` They tend to get corrupted or lazy. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ran downhill at the end of his second term. Even <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> did.'' And in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Prime Minster <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, after 10 years in office, `` is beginning to get a little schoolmistressish.'' <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION> says newspapers are better than ever. Competition from broadcasting has forced them to do what they should _ `` report the causes and consequences of things, not just the event itself.'' He says it is healthy when people do n't like newspapers. `` We're not cheerleaders,'' he says. `` It's our business to carry the news, the way the mailman carries the mail.'' But he salutes the power of television to wring changes. Newspapers wrote about injustice to the blacks for years, but the pictures of police turning their dogs on demonstrators made the difference. `` If you had TV coverage, the first and second world wars would have ended sooner,'' he says. Television is what's forcing change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. People there see the rest of the world and begin to think it's crazy that they `` have to line up for 10 hours to get a turnip.'' But the revolution is just beginning, he says. It took a century and a civil war for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to accommodate to its states' rights problems. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is now running into states' rights problems. It's going to take a long to resolve and, if the Russians can do it without a civil war, they'll be very lucky.''

 Anti-Communist marchers, striking workers and clashes between police and protesters vied Tuesday with a scaled-down military parade on <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> celebrated the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Even President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tempered the Revolution Day festivities by saying the nation's economic problems hang like a `` sword of Damocles over us.'' A column of about 5,000 marchers paraded peacefully through <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to challenge <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> authority, while a few miles away, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other leaders celebrated the 72nd anniversary of the revolution reviewing the traditional show of military force. Activists in the southwest republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> said police broke up a crowd of thousands of would-be protesters and beat some of them. The military part of the parade in its capital, <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, was canceled. In the Arctic city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, striking coal miners joined the official celebration, but carried slogans demanding more independence and that the government fulfill promises of better living and working conditions. In some trouble spots, such as the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, state-run media said traditional parades were canceled. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, an activist from the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, said a small group of people burned a red Soviet flag in the center of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, interviewed by Soviet TV atop <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s Mausoleum in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, acknowledged that many Soviets feel threatened by food shortages and the disorganization of the consumer market. `` When all this is hanging like a sword of <LOCATION> Damocles </LOCATION> over us, it is very important we do not forget the main thing, that this is the way we have chosen to follow,'' he said, referring to the Greek legend in which a sword was strung by a single hair over the head of <LOCATION> Damocles </LOCATION>, a royal attendant, to show the precariousness of power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviet leadership has not yet been able to replace fully the administrative system of the past, and `` thus there exists a loss, or a weakening of control. Shall we go back? That would be a mistake, the greatest mistake.'' The anniversary marks the day in 1917 when the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> seized power from a provisional government that had ruled for about eight months after <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> abdicated. Those who marched more than four hours in the unofficial column made clear they believed the revolution had gotten them little but food shortages, pollution, and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. `` We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing having changed for the better, and this is our protest,'' said <PERSON> Taisya </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlyonova </PERSON>, a retiree. One placard characterized communist rule as `` 72 years on the road to nowhere.'' Police supervised their route from northwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the city's Olympic stadium less than two miles from <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where they held a rally. Organizers had reached an agreement with city officials not to head for Red Square, and roads to the center were blocked by double lines of police in case they changed their mind. Grassroots groups marched in official parades in several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities last year, but this apparently was the first counterdemonstration of any size permitted on Revolution Day. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Moldavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organization, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, that police beat people in a crowd of thousands who gathered near a monument to national hero <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> the Great near the parade route before dawn He said more were beaten by police who dispersed a crowd of a couple of about 100 <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> supporters on <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>. Officials canceled the military part of the parade, but a demonstration of workers went off as scheduled. Following that, <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said, thousands of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> supporters marched the parade route with slogans condemning the police and the republic's leadership He did not know how many people were injured or detained by police, but said that most of those detained were released within hours. In <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, coal miners who have been on strike for two weeks joined the official celebration, but with their own banners, said city strike committee spokesman <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Belyaev </PERSON>. The slogans called on the government to fulfill the promises it made in July to end a walkout, criticized bureaucracy, and demanded more independence. Strikers met on the eve of the holiday with Coal Ministry <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON>, but did not agree to return to work. <PERSON> Belyaev </PERSON> said only regular maintenance was done at the striking mines Tuesday, and it was unclear when the strike would end. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, where local <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organizations declared the Bolshevik Revolution was a coup that curtailed the country's development of democracy, the official Latinform news agency reported no disturbances Activists reported <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, a hotbed of <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> activists, was quiet as well. The parade on Red Square, held under a leaden sky with temperatures just above freezing, was more low-key than in previous years. No strategic missiles were in evidence. The military part of the parade, including more than 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and paratroopers, a speech by Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, a rumble of distant cannon fire and a show of military hardware, took slightly more than 30 minutes. The military hardware took only five minutes to rumble through the medieval square, leaving behind clouds of smoke and the smell of diesel fuel. A 90-minute march of thousands of people carrying officially approved banners, paper flowers and balloons followed. Several slogans demanded an end to extremism in the tense relations between Soviet ethnic groups. One poster, protesting increasing prices, showed a vacuum cleaner, labeled `` prices,'' sucking rubles away from a working man.

 Turnout was heavy today as <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s bid to become the nation's first elected black governor went to the voters after a race in which abortion and negative campaigning emerged as major issues. `` We're on roller skates,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, registrar in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, describing the activity in her office. `` I think it's going to be a record in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> anyway. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant governor, and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, flew across the state Monday to warn supporters against complacency and too much reliance on polls showing <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> ahead. `` We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> told about two dozen volunteers at <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s airport. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, pointing to an overcast and drizzling sky at a state Capitol rally in the afternoon for about 100 supporters, said everything was sunny. `` It's only in perception,'' he said. The weather was cloudy this morning. Campaign workers on both sides staffed telephone banks Monday to call potential supporters and urge them to vote. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a former attorney general, spent the day with Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and was met in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for attorney general, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee for lieutenant governor, <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, was campaigning separately. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and his running mates, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for lieutenant governor and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> seeking re-election as attorney general, stayed together and were joined by Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. While race was the question that focused attention on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> early in the campaign, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> upset many expectations when he made his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s stand caught <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, an opponent of abortions, by surprise. As the campaign progressed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> conceded he was being hurt by the abortion issue. The campaign has gotten acrimonious at times. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate has aired a commercial portraying his Democratic opponent as insensitive to rape victims, and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has inveighed against <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> for invoking the name of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in a televised debate because he said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> urged a veto of a state holiday honoring King. In <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said he felt `` exceedingly good'' about the chances for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> sweep of the state's top three offices. But he also played down a <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> poll on Sunday showing him 9 points ahead of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> _ 45 percent to 36 percent _ with 19 percent undecided. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he has the most effective grass-roots organization in state history and that his workers were out to `` energize the precinct organization.'' `` Our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` All we have to do is get the vote out.''

 Struggling to cope with a flood of people from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, the government Tuesday approved emergency plans to build 400,000 apartments to house the refugees. The waves of newcomers this year _ nearly 200,000 of them East Germans making a dramatic exodus to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ is starting to overwhelm <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. East Germans, ethnic Germans from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and asylum-seekers are rapidly changing the face of the nation. Those three groups are expected to account for about 700,000 newcomers this year. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with a population of nearly 62 million, has been an economic success story and has become a magnet for East Germans, as well as the ethnic Germans across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has welcomed them, there is increasing uneasiness about the thousands of new citizens. `` We have to tell them that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is not a paradise,'' West German trade union federation chief <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Breit </PERSON> told a postal workers' conference on Sunday in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Breit </PERSON> was referring to the expectations of the East Germans, many politicians, business leaders and ordinary West Germans are beginning to question the country's ability to handle the strains posed by the newcomers. Social services have been strapped and the influx of children has filled kindergartens to capacity nationwide. Clothing drives for the new arrivals have become an almost daily occurrence. Local governments have been crying out for more federal aid to bear the load, and unemployment is swelling to nearly 2 million. There was a shortage of affordable housing even before <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities found themselves unable to hold back the flood and East Germans fled by the thousands. Tuesday's approval of $ 4.3 billion to subsidize construction of the new apartments over a four-year period is nearly twice the amount planned for low-cost housing just a few months ago. But Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government felt it had to act to ease the housing crisis. As housing shortages persist, social services are overloaded and unemployment rises, the government is expected to face demands for action to slow the flow of newcomers. West German politicians have shown increasing signs of alarm and have called on East German authorities to institute reforms to halt the exodus. `` We want them -LRB- East Germans -RRB- to be able to live in their traditional home there and to be able to find happiness,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> convention on Saturday. Many of the East German refugees are being put up in hotels and others have been housed in camps or on floating barracks designed for construction workers. East Germans put up in a temporary shelter in a camping area in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> have already staged a protest, complaining of `` unbearable conditions'' and saying they ca n't afford the $ 43 they have to pay per month, per person. But housing is only one of the problems. The federal labor office said Monday the number of unemployed workers among the East German refugees stood at 61,700 as of last month, out of the total of 167,200 people who had reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by then. The total East German refugee number is expected to top 200,000 by the end of the year. Still, many employers look at the East Germans as a source of new labor, willing to take jobs that West Germans avoid and perhaps willing to work for lower wages. Ethnic Germans and asylum-seekers already were stretching social services and local budgets before August, when the East Germans started flowing into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We still expect between 350,000 and 400,000 ethnic Germans this year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruehl </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> specialist who helps to integrate the influx of ethnic Germans from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the federal government is spending $ 1.2 billion this year to teach them German, while many also receive substantial unemployment benefits. As of October, there were 115,000 unemployed among the recent arrivals of ethnic Germans. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also has attracted huge numbers of political asylum-seekers, most of them from Third World countries as well as <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. They benefit from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s liberal policies that allow most of the asylum-seekers stay for years even if their application is rejected. On Sunday, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, appealed for more help for the asylum-seekers who are allowed to stay even if their request is rejected. `` These people often live for years in legal uncertainty and without any outlook for the future,'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> told a church convention in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Krozingen </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION>. Rejection of an asylum application generally bars the foreigners from working legally in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. On Monday, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced that 98,700 asylum-seekers had arrived in the first 10 months of the year.

<HEAD>High Court Hears Arguments Over Children vs. Parents Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In an emotionally charged case pitting protection for children against the rights of parents, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Tuesday to uphold the indefinite jailing of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts. Social workers fear the child may be dead. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirviss </PERSON>, a lawyer appointed to represent the missing child, predicted `` extreme ramifications'' if the mother is allowed to go free to safeguard her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Upholding her rights would mean `` an infant who is defenseless and abused must be abandoned in an unprecedented extension of the Fifth Amendment,'' he said. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> agreed. `` Where will we be if the state can not enforce'' contempt of court orders to assure children's safety? he asked. `` Will the most effective remedy be taken away?'' Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfare could hamstring juvenile courts, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. The court engaged in a spirited one-hour discussion in the case of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>, 23, in a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> jail for more than 18 months for refusing to disclose where her son is. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, said authorities have other alternatives to jailing the parent indefinitely for contempt of court. She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a three-year prison term, he said. `` It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` It's not a matter of ` we ca n't do it. We just wo n't do it.''' Some justices raised the possibility that a ruling in the case, expected by July, could rest on narrower grounds. Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> noted that since <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> was jailed, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> has enacted a law that permits law enforcement officials to grant limited immunity from prosecution to compel testimony. In <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s case, they suggested, the state could require her to reveal her son's whereabouts in return for assurances that the disclosure will not be used to convict her of any criminal charges. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> described the process as `` a laser-like limited immunity'' that would permit prosecution of <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> without compromising her protection against self-incrimination. Social workers last saw <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> in September 1987, when he was 11 months old. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> was admitted to a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> hospital on Jan. 23, 1987, when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and other injuries. For a while, he was held in protective care after his emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> into his crib during the infant's hospitalization. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987, after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo training in parenting skills. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> expressed dismay Tuesday at that development. `` Why do we need hindsight'' to realize the boy was in jeopardy, he said. `` Was n't it apparent at the time?'' Nine months after <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> was returned to his mother, social workers said <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> no longer was cooperating with them. Moreover, they said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>'s father recently had been shot to death in a drug-related killing and <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> was using drugs. The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28, 1988, after she refused to disclose <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>'s whereabouts. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in December that jailing her for refusing to disclose the information violates her constitutional protection against self-incrimination. But she has remained in jail under an order by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. Some have compared the <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> case to that of Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, released from prison on Sept. 25 after more than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter visit the girl's father, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s former husband. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, for court-ordered visits with the father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> accused her former husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently has denied. In a pair of decisions Tuesday, the court: _ Refused, by a 7-2 vote, to ease the technical requirements facing people who sue to protect the environment The justices ruled that the victory it took an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> farm couple three years and $ 95,000 to win against their county for polluting their water supply had to be thrown out because government agencies were not notified before the lawsuit was filed. _ Voted 8-1 to make it easier for insurance companies to sue in federal court to challenge worker compensation awards The decision allows an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> insurer to go into federal court to attack a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man's worker compensation benefits.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s persistence has paid off. Seven years after the retired <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official launched a campaign to change the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> maps of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the lines have been redrawn. Soon after he retired in 1981, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> noticed that a government-published map book showed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> despite the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never recognized <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 1950 annexation of the 2,200-square-mile territory. The redrawn <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> map shows the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as a cultural region bearing its original Biblical name of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION>, not attached to either <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. For years, the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maps published by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> showed the Israeli-Jordanian border drawn along the 1949 armistice line between the two countries, which defined <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s physical borders until the 1967 war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in that war and has occupied the land since, despite calls from the rest of the world to negotiate a political settlement for the territory. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he pursued his case in a `` factual rather than ideological'' manner. `` If I were trying to peddle my views, I would n't have gotten very far,'' he said. His first step was a letter to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, then President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secretary of state. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> referred <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s letter to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of the Geographer. That office maps official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on sovereignty issues for internal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publications and acts as an advisory and arbitration board for other government agencies issuing maps. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> began corresponding with the geographer, who issued a 1982 directive ordering cartographers to stop showing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as anyone's territory. Still, most maps went unchanged. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also wrote his congressman, who unsuccessfully pursued the case with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who had dealt with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was treasury secretary, asked for a meeting in 1984. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> made his case meticulously, buying a computer to help prepare 92 documents for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to buttress his argument. The meeting was exciting, he said, but nothing changed. Also in 1984, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> read an article by then-deputy <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who said the agency was emphasizing accuracy and objectivity. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he called <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and `` told him his people were not adhering to his standards.'' Two days later, on Jan. 2, 1985, he met with two <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials. They promised the maps would be changed. But a year later, nothing had changed, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Only after dealing with the agency's chief cartographer, did his crusade bear fruit. The map of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was changed in 1986, but it took until January 1989 to change the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> map. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reluctant to ascribe all the credit to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, but concedes his campaign influenced the decision. `` He was very, very active, and believed in his cause,'' said one official familiar with the case. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who knew from bitter experience how hard it was to bring about any political change in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, was more expansive. `` I'm glad you kept at it and accomplished something that is of genuine and lasting significance,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> earlier this year.

 Two men and two women briefly disrupted <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> proceedings Tuesday, as they stood up to denounce a recent high court ruling limiting abortion rights. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has declared war on women and I'm here to declare war on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said one of the woman, according to spectators in the courtroom. `` I had an abortion 20 years ago. ...'' said the other woman before she was led from the courtroom by court police. All four were arrested and charged with disrupting the high court, an offense that carries a 30-day jail sentence and a $ 100 fine upon conviction, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. Arrested were <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Madewell </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Troxell </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahl </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A group called <ORGANIZATION> Refuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Resist distributed a statement that said the protest was intended to focus attention on the court as `` an oppressor of women.'' `` The oppressors of women will know no peace until the dogs are called off from attacking women's -LRB- abortion -RRB- clinics,'' the statement said. The court last July 3 gave states new power to limit abortions, but stopped short of overturning its 1973 ruling that said women have a constitutional right to abortion. Such protests are highly unusual during the normally sedate court proceedings.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has applied to rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> after an absence of eight years, a senior chess official said Tuesday. `` It's a return to the fold,'' said the federation's president, <PERSON> Florencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be considered a provisional member of the 124-member federation as soon as it pays its back dues. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomenei </PERSON>, the late Iranian leader, banned chess following the 1979 revolution. Last fall, however, he said the game was acceptable so long as it did not involve gambling. The general secretary of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Khosra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirandi </PERSON>, told chess officials that women and men would not be allowed to play one another, according to <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a member of the international federation's 14-man executive council. <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would compete with the other countries of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` There was a question of whether it was compatible for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to be in that zone, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was in the same zone, and Mr. <PERSON> Harandi </PERSON> said there was no problem from that direction,'' he said. <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> said the last Iranian to compete in a federation competition was in 1979, although it continued to pay membership dues until 1982. <PERSON> Casto </PERSON> <PERSON> Abundo </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the federation's general secretary, said he did not know how much the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> owed in unpaid dues.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> voters chose between Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> for governor today, with <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> heavily favored for the office he nearly won eight years ago. Turnout was reported moderate in some places to heavy in others, including <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s district in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` It's <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> driving it,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the Democratic administrator with the <ORGANIZATION> Camden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let's be honest here _ that's the only issue in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' The two candidates ended their campaigns with vote-seeking dashes despite <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s wide lead in the polls. `` I'm very comfortable that we've been able to get our message out, and now of course the goal is to get people out to vote,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said at an election eve rally Monday at a racetrack in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The rally, which featured fireworks and a 10-piece rock-jazz band entertaining 4,000 supporters, brought a raucous end to <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s bid to win the job he lost narrowly to Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in 1981. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> continued to dismiss the polls that show him trailing by 24 points. `` We have a great state and it's important for all of us to go to the polls on Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> told supporters in <LOCATION> Lyndhurst </LOCATION>. `` Ignore what some of the pundits are saying, ignore what some of the pollsters are saying, because people are the ones who vote, not polls.'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who has held a consistent lead in the polls, has widened the gap to 24 points over <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, according to a poll released Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eagleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> and The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in 1981 by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.4 million cast, or one-twelfth of 1 percent, the closest margin in state history. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s campaign has been mired in internal problems and the candidate has stumbled on some delicate issues such as abortion and homosexual rights. By contrast, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has largely avoided pitfalls and put <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> on the defensive. A series of nasty television commercials have marked both campaigns. Each candidate ran a commercial in which his opponent's nose grew a la Pinocchio with every alleged lie or misleading statement cited in the spot. In addition to today's gubernatorial election, also at stake is the battle for control of the Assembly. Republicans hold a 41-39 edge, and there are hotly contested races in 10 districts. The party that wins control of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> also will control the redrawing of congressional districts after the 1990 census. The Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which does not face election this year.

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Tuesday he rejected the entire peace plan adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and the general's followers roamed Christian areas, beating street vendors who ignored a strike supporting him The Christian army commander originally accepted political reforms in the accord worked out at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, but rejected security arrangements that did not include a timetable for withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls the Syrians, who are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, an occupation army. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded in a six-month artillery war between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s men and the Syrians that was suspended by a truce in September. On Tuesday, the general said: `` We reject all of the Taif accord. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was killed in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> and buried in <LOCATION> Kleiat </LOCATION>, where they elected a president for a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> state in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Parliament met at <LOCATION> Kleiat </LOCATION> in Syrian-controlled northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday and elected <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, as president. It also endorsed political reforms worked out by legislators at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation, which give Moslems more power in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil war. The legislators moved their Sunday session to northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> threatened to shell the Parliament building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. At a news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said: `` A plan has been prepared, details of which will not be announced now, to defend our liberated area,'' a reference to the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which 1 million Christians live. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has no control in the 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> outside the enclave, and the peace accord presumably will be applied there. He also has serious opposition from other Christians and it is unclear how long the government central bank will continue paying his bills. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> is not an elected president, he is only a former legislator; I had dissolved Parliament before his election,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said at his headquarters and residence, a bunker beneath the shattered presidential place in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He and acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> have led competing Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> ended without <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> agreeing on a successor. By unwritten covenant, the president has been Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker Shiite Moslem since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled the government, army and judiciary, but Moslems now make up 55 percent of the population. Their demand for more power is a main cause of the civil war, which has taken more than 150,000 lives since 1975. Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> drove to <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> late Tuesday to see him, and told reporters: `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has supported and continues to support <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity, will extend all assistance requested by the government ... to establish its authority on every inch of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' In a clear reference to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, he said: `` No one, no matter how far he goes in craziness, can continue because the process of reconciliation will bypass the deviationists and all those who sabotaged the unity of the nation and are trying to subvert reconciliation and reunification <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, continued consultations with politicians to form a government of national unity that would try to end the war. At the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, about 500 youths chanted `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is the legitimate leader!'' Waving Lebanese flags and placard portraits of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, they shouted for President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to `` protect <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' About 40 of them began a sit-in at the main gate. The French have been the Christians' main protectors since they governed the country under a League of Nations mandate. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations and other governments have declared support for Mouawad. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> asked his followers to end the two-day strike, because they had `` expressed your views honestly.'' Witnesses in <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters with sticks beat vegetable vendors who ignored the strike. One said a vendor shouted while being beaten: `` We want peace! We want to work to make money! We live from hand-to-mouth!'' An editor at Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the main radio station in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said privately that 100 of the general's followers tried to storm the station Monday night and read statements on the air, but <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen guarding the building drove them off

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers guarding a military site at <LOCATION> Galeta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> exchanged gunfire twice Friday with a small group of unidentified intruders, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. `` There were no known casualties and sweeps conducted in the area at daybreak revealed no evidence of intruders or hostile fire,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> told reporters. However, one <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> MP was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hospital with arm, leg and head injuries sustained in a fall into barbed wire.

There was a second exchange somewhat later, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the exchange of gunfire was the first in months. After the failed coup attempt against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in the region _ Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> _ recommended that the rotations of military personnel be speeded up so that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents could be removed from the area more speedily. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said that no decision had been made on that recommendation. There are about 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military permanently assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with slightly more than 2,000 on temporary duty.

 Now that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refuses to help, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> risks up to a year in jail and a $ 500 fine if she lets her boyfriend stay overnight while her children are home. But the <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, woman struck a defiant tone, describing as `` almost a challenge'' the high court's decision Monday not to review a judge's order restricting her overnight male guests. `` I'd love to see what official is going to enforce'' it, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said she is no longer dating the man involved in the case, but her new boyfriend sometimes sleeps over while the children are home. A judge ordered the visitation limit as an outgrowth of a child-custody battle between Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> and her former husband, and a lawyer representing the woman said the order has a sexist overtone. `` I would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve as moral guardians of a family where a man is involved,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chapter <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSimone </PERSON>, an attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>'s former husband, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, said he was not surprised by the court's action because he did not feel that a federal question was involved. And <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he believed the high court chose not to take the case because the justices felt it was `` simply a strange little case from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that did n't deserve the court's attention.'' The Parrillos were divorced in 1986. Under a joint custody agreement, their three children live with her and their father has visitation privileges. Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>, 33, said her ex-husband began to harass her when he learned she was dating <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPippo </PERSON>. She asked for a court order limiting <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>'s visitation rights, requiring him to see the children at specific times away from the home. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> countered by asking a judge to prevent Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> from having overnight male guests. Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who has since retired, barred Mrs. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> `` from allowing any unrelated males to stay overnight'' when the children are home. The judge said having such guests is not `` a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into.'' The children were 8, 10 and 13 when the judge issued his order in late 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s order in March, saying `` We can not fault -LRB- <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s -RRB- actions. We see no great constitutional issue in this controversy.'' Neither side had sought experts to testify about the psychological effect of the visits on the children. In other matters, the high court: _ Removed the last legal obstacle to carrying out a $ 2.5 billion settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control device _ Agreed to decide in a case from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> whether lawsuits charging employers with violating a key federal anti-bias law must be filed in federal, not state, courts _ Heard arguments in an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> case over the asserted right to use the hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice A decision is expected by July. _ Agreed to decide in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case whether a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in a fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault

 As New Yorkers today decided whether <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> will be their mayor, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, the candidate's one-time honorary campaign chairman, bad news _ it voted out his series. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s `` Chicken Soup,'' a new situation comedy in which he plays a Jewish ex-salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic, has been canceled. The eighth and final episode airs tonight. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> quit the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign in September over remarks he made about the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate's Democratic rival, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who is black. Among other things, the rabbi-turned-comedian said Jews would vote for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> out of guilt. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> apologized for his remarks, which were reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, and said he had learned that `` what's funny on stage can be insensitive when it's said off the stage and in the world of politics. And for my insensitivity, I apologize.'' <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretemeyer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, would not say whether the cancellation was in any way due to the controversy. In a statement, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> president, called <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s show `` a well-executed program'' but said it did n't realize <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s hopes that it would help maintain the network's ratings strength on Tuesday, `` our key night `` Chicken Soup'' follows the hit `` Roseanne.'' `` Clearly, we're disappointed that ` Chicken Soup' did n't achieve that objective,'' he said. `` Chicken Soup,'' which co-starred <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> as the object of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s affections, had averaged respectable ratings _ an 18.6 rating and a 29 per cent share of the audience in its Tuesday time slot _ and occasionally landed in the top 15. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. The show was the third new series dropped so far this season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has canceled `` <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> its `` The People Next Door.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said `` Coach,'' a comedy that premiered last season and stars <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as a college football coach, will succeed `` Chicken Soup'' starting Nov. 21.

<HEAD>Journey for Reconciliation With Poland Gets Off on Wrong Foot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a troubled quest for reconciliation with an erstwhile enemy, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Thursday with aid to offer and two diplomatic dustups to overcome. The first visit by a West German chancellor in 12 years is aimed at normalizing relations with the East European state overrun by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a half century ago. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> brings with him more than $ 1 billion worth of financial aid and credit guarantees to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> through the transition to a market-oriented economy. But the historic visit and prospects for a clean break with past hostilities have been marred by the hasty resignation of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and embarrassment over <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s failed attempt to visit the scene of a 1921 battle between Germans and Poles The trip has been beset by volatile negotiations stalled by the leadership changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and disputes within the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government over the nature and pace of assistance <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should offer to promote reform. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had expressed the wish this year that a high-level West German delegation make the emotional gesture of attending memorials in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> marking the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II. However, negotiators for the two states were unable to clear away old political and economic differences until Oct. 3, preventing an official visit coinciding with the Sept. 1 anniversary. Despite that missed opportunity, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit remains a symbolic atonement for the wartime horrors inflicted on Poles by Germans. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and other West German officials have spearheaded the drive for Western aid to reward reform-minded nations like <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as they move away from planned economies and Stalinist controls on personal freedom. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> already is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s biggest Western trading partner. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> announced earlier it would reschedule or forgive $ 1.3 billion of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s overdue foreign debt. West German banks and government lending institutions hold about 20 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign loans, which total $ 39 billion, or more than $ 1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Teltschik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief foreign affairs adviser, said before the trip to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that West German aid could potentially exceed the billion-dollar level established in the negotiations he conducted with <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Pszon </PERSON> of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> will guarantee credits for any `` economically reasonable'' joint-venture projects agreed to by West German firms, <PERSON> Teltschik </PERSON> said. He said the test of their economic reason would be whether they promised to be self-financing within a few years. Among the agreements to be signed by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> are credit guarantees for projects to improve living conditions in the areas of western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> populated by ethnic Germans. Nearly one third of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was once German territory. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plans to meet with members of the German minority in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, but has scrapped a plan to visit <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> because of strong objections by his Polish hosts. The mountain, known in German as <PERSON> Annaberg </PERSON>, was the scene of bloody confrontation between Poles and Germans in 1921. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> officials reportedly feared that a visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> could stir inter-ethnic hostilities in the formerly German region of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>. The Annaberg plan was deemed ill-considered and has been compared with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s controversial 1985 visit with President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to an SS gravesite in <LOCATION> Bitburg </LOCATION>. Adding to the pre-departure turmoil was the unceremonious exit of the West German ambassador to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Two weeks prior to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeller </PERSON>, 63, was granted early retirement after claiming the stress of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit and a recent flood of East German refugees through the embassy had damaged his health West German media have reported ulterior motives for <PERSON> Schoeller </PERSON>'s decision to step down at such a crucial time, contending it was prompted by internal disputes within the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government or by his alleged involvement in an arms trading firm

<HEAD>Defense Attorney Seeks Jurors With Awareness of Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 300 potential jurors will be interviewed starting Wednesday about their awareness of drunken driving as the trial starts for a man accused of killing 27 people in a fiery bus crash. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 83 separate crimes, including 27 counts of murder, for his role in the crash of a church bus on Interstate 71 on the night of May 14, 1988. The prosecution charged that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was drunk behind the wheel of his pickup truck traveling the wrong way on the highway when it slammed into a bus from a Radcliff church returning from an outing at an amusement park. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said he knows that most potential jurors will have heard of the case, which prompted national debate over the safety of school buses and the dangers of drunken drivers. `` They know it happened,'' <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. `` They know it inflamed passions and prejudice in them. But despite whatever those are, that they will at least make a sincere promise to go out of their way to try and be objective.'' The prospective jurors will be questioned in three large groups before individual interviews that Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> has ordered closed to the public. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said his ideal juror will have some understanding of how widespread drinking and driving has become. Potential jurors also will be asked if they have been convicted of drunken driving. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence several years ago in another case. He currently faces a charge of driving under the influence in the current proceeding, along with dozens of assault and wanton endangerment charges for the injuries to the 40 people who escaped death in the crash. After the crash, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> spent several weeks in the hospital and was then examined at the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He was jailed until until October 1988, when his family put together enough money and property to post his $ 540,000 bond. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> returned to work at <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> and lives with his parents in nearby <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> neither drives nor drinks anymore, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. Survivors of the crash, most of whom were members of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>, are expected to testify at the trial. People who lost family members in the crash are expected to attend at least parts of the trial, which could last six weeks or more.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the `` Night Stalker'' who butchered or raped more than a dozen people in an orgy of violence that terrorized <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1985, was sentenced to death in the gas chamber today. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> followed the recommendation of the jury that convicted the devil-worshiping 29-year-old on Sept. 20. In the courtroom before his sentencing, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, wearing dark glases, uttered a rambling, nearly inaudible statement that ended with the words: `` Lucifer dwells within us all.'' The killer, who entered unlocked houses late at night to attack people in their beds, was convicted of 13 murders and 30 other felonies, including rape, burglary and sodomy. The jurors, some of whom said the defendant had tried to intimidate them during the trial by sneering and glaring at them, recommended Oct. 4 that he be sentenced to death rather than life in prison. A snarling, gravelly-voiced <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> had sneered at the possibility of being sentenced to death. `` Big deal. Death comes with the territory,'' he told reporters after the jury's recommendation `` See you in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>.'' After his conviction, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> flashed a two-fingered `` devil sign'' at photographers and muttered, `` Evil.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday steered clear of criticizing his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for accepting a $ 2 million trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> saying, `` everybody's got to make a living.'' He also passed up an opportunity to comment on <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s controversial book, `` My Turn,'' but indicated his recollection of his relationship with her husband was not quite the same as what she wrote Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told her during the height of the Iran-Contra controversy that he thought Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> should resign. She said she told him to tell her husband that, and he said, `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, that's not my role.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he shared that recollection, and if his own vice president, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, should act that way. `` No, I think it's his role to tell me anything that's on his mind, which is exactly the relationship I had with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and that's the way I worked as vice president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. Asked to comment further on Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s version, he said, `` No, I ca n't help you on that. I do n't want to get into that one.'' Then he added, laughing, `` Why? Never mind.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether it was appropriate for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to accept $ 2 million from a communications congolmerate for a speaking trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last month. He said, `` I will not have anything negative to say about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if this is an invitation for that, because I'd prefer to emphasize the positive parts of that trip, talking openly about the need for freer trade, the affection shown to him by the <LOCATION> Japanse </LOCATION> people It's important symbolism when it comes to this relationship that sometimes has strain.'' Pressed on whether former presidents should make money through private industry, he said, `` I have no problem with that, providing it's not overdone. Everybody's got to make a living.''

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is preparing a confrontation with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on civil rights by proposing an update of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that the president has called unnecessary. The legislation that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat plans to file within weeks would overturn several <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings handed down in June that made it easier to challenge affirmative action programs and more difficult for workers to sue their employers for racial bias. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said then that the impact of the decisions was being overblown. One highly publicized decision upheld the right of several white firefighters from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to challenge the department's minority hiring plan Republican conservatives in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> say they will fight the legislation, particularly if the president sticks by his position. `` If the president is committed to a veto, we can sustain a veto,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, adding that civil rights advocates want to embarass <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't sure more legislation is needed. `` In my view, the need is obvious,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` A new national civil rights act will send a strong message that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does not intend to abandon our 25-year-long commitment to civil rights.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said the administration is taking a `` wait-and-see'' attitude. `` We have n't come out and said absolutely no to the legislation,'' she said. `` We do n't think the legislation is absolutely necessary at this time, but once it's proposed we will not sit back.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other lawmakers have been working with a broad array of civil rights advocates, labor unions and women's groups to craft a bill that can be introduced in virtually identical form in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

Troops confiscated at least $ 1.5 million in machinery, cars, household goods and personal effects to be sold at auction. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Atrash </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, estimated 90 percent of the town of 10,000 people boycotted paying taxes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest the military occupation. <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> is just southeast of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Stinging under a storm of international criticism, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> lifted its roadblocks around the town last week. On Monday, Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> shifted the focus of the debate, describing the ax-murders or stabbings of five Palestinians in October. The victims were mutilated, some in front of family members or while praying in a mosque. `` Indeed, the rate of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attacks against Palestinians increased sharply following the promulgation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace initiative in April 1989,'' he said, saying seven times as many Palestinians were being attacked.

<TEXT>
 The Statehouse painting of the two <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> who signed the Declaration of Independence is perfect in every detail _ except one of the faces is of the wrong person. An error dating to 1823 caused <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> statesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> to end up in former <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' spot in the portrait that hangs outside the House speaker's office The mistake was discovered more than a decade ago, but no one did anything about it until <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' descendents kicked up a fuss. It finally will be fixed Wednesday with the unveiling of a new portrait _ but <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> will have to settle for a picture of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON>. `` Amazing,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, whose office is in charge of Statehouse tours and guidebooks. `` It's kind of comical, actually.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> left no portraits behind when he died in 1785, and when artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> sought him out seven years later for inclusion in his famous painting of the signers of the declaration, he had to settle for <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. Townspeople assured <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> that the son closely resembled the father. <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> finished the painting in 1820, and three years later prepared a key matching faces to names. But he confused <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> scholar. `` There's no way of knowing how it came to be confused,'' <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It was a long time since he had done the painting and he might have just confused them.'' Shortly after the Statehouse was built in 1900, officials decided they needed a portrait of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON>, the two <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> who signed the Declaration of Independence, so they sought out the Trumbull painting and had an artist copy the patriots' faces. The artist, relying on the key, faithfully painted <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said she discovered the errors in 1972 while comparing <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON>'s original sketches of the signers with the finished work. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> became aware of the error shortly after <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> published her findings, but nothing was done because `` it's a beautiful picture'' and `` no one knew except scholars and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> fans'' that the face was not correct, said state Rep. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickman </PERSON>. There was another problem: no one knows who is responsible for the dozens of dusty paintings that line the Statehouse walls. The secretary of state's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> each say the other is responsible. The secretary of state does have some power to decide where the paintings should be hung, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. But her records show the Hopkins-Ellery portrait is in the governor's office. No one knows how it ended up outside the speaker's office. Last year, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' heirs finally persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to replace the picture. A commission, of which <PERSON> Rickman </PERSON> was a member, hired <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> for $ 4,000 to make a new portrait. <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said his work is based on the Trumbull sketch of <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and an examination of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' home, which still exists in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said there was no way <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON>'s sketch could be wrong. `` The eyes are gray, and the hair and so forth,'' <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. `` It's quite specific.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a practicing Quaker, was wearing a hat as his religion required, in <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON>'s painting, while <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a lapsed <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>, was not, <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A drug trafficking trial has taken a startling turn with the defendant testifying he was trying to track down a drug dealer he says absconded with $ 500,000 in a plot to kill <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s former leader. The unusual defense, built around <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> President Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> who died in a mysterious plane crash, is n't something the defendant's lawyer said he would have chosen to take into the courtroom `` It's not my idea of the best defense believe me,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrarone </PERSON>, court-appointed attorney for <PERSON> Mushtaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` I would prefer not to have my guy stand up and say, ` I may have been involved in an assassination.''' Prosecutors declined comment as they prepared to begin cross-examination Wednesday. The 41-year-old defendant, who prosecutors say is known as `` The Black Prince,'' stopped short of saying he was involved in the plane crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> on Aug. 17, 1988. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on the drug charges five months before the crash in which 29 other people died, including <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> is being tried on charges of conspiracy and importation of heroin. Prosecutors claim <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> arranged for <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, to bring $ 10 million in heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> was arrested at a bus terminal in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in February 1988. He was carrying a nylon handbag filled with two kilograms of heroin that he told authorities he had been given in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to sell for <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>. After his arrest, <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> arranged a meeting in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent operating under the alias `` Mr. Costa.'' Transcripts of those calls have been introduced as evidence. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> and the agent met, ostensibly to make plans to go to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, but instead <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> was arrested and returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>'s defense, according to his testimony Monday, is that he actually had contracted with <PERSON> Houchaimi </PERSON> to kill <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> testified he advanced at least $ 500,000 to <LOCATION> Houchaimi </LOCATION> on behalf of superiors in the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, currently led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, to hire people and buy equipment for the assassination. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said he followed the 51-year-old Houchaimi to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after it became obvious that the plot was stalled. He said he then played along with drug plans in hopes of retrieving the money. `` I do n't know anything about money for heroin in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he testified Monday. `` <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> was basically in a position where he would have been totally wiped out. He has said that he would either have to come up with this money or commit suicide,'' <PERSON> Ferrarone </PERSON> said. The lawyer said his client does n't fear retribution for his testimony of assassination plotting from the current <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> government, which maintains the cause of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death is unknown. The Pakistani consulate in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> did not return a telephone call to The Associated Press on Tuesday.

 A second computer problem within a week at the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> caused some flight delays Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` There was never a safety issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitaliere </PERSON>. `` The worst-case scenario was massive delays, and that never happened.'' Officials said a problem with telephone lines caused a computer at <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to lose contact with some remote radar facilities, meaning information about some flights had to be put into the system manually. The problem started in the early morning hours and was corrected by noon, causing minimal delays in flights, Ms. <PERSON> Spitaliere </PERSON> said. She said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the cause and trying to determine how it can be prevented from reoccurring. Thousands of airline passengers flying into, out of or through the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area encountered long delays Friday when air traffic controllers at the center lost about half their computer capacity. Flights headed for the nation's capital were grounded in various cities and flights in the air were kept about 25 percent farther apart, officials said.

<HEAD>Amazon Destruction Declines, Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increased government control and inspection has caused a significant decline in the destruction of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rainforest, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s top environmental official said Tuesday. `` We're still waiting for the final numbers, but we estimate the devastation will be 30 percent less than in 1988. The results are not optimal, but they are very good,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> and Renewable Natural Resources. The destruction could have been curbed even more, <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had provided requested aid for ecological protection. `` Regrettably, we did n't get any help,'' he said. The institute was founded earlier this year amid an international outcry over the devastation of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 2 million-square-mile <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, the world's largest. <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said he went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to seek money for radar-mapping equipment, patrol helicopters, patrol boats, four-wheel drive vehicles and telecommunications gear. He said he could n't get the equipment from his own government, `` because <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> just does n't have the money.'' However, he said, Brazilian sources provided five patrol helicopters that were instrumental in spotting unauthorized tree cutting and burning. Last year, illegal land clearing by farmers, ranchers, prospectors and peasant settlers wrecked some 55,350 square miles of Brazilian rainforest, according to the government. The heaviest rains in more than five years also helped save Amazonian trees from being burned, <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. The institute, which supervises only 612 forest rangers in a region about half the size of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, summarily removed local forest officials suspected of corruption and protecting landowners who were destroying the ecology, <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. Inspectors discovered 300,000 acres of illegally cleared jungle land from Aug. 1-Nov. 3 and levied fines of about $ 16 million `` The situation is very difficult,'' <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. `` We are up against powerful interests. They try to buy off forest officials, and when that does n't work they threaten to kill them.'' He said one federal official on an inspection mission was killed this year, others were shot at or intimidated, and an institute helicopter was sabotaged. Also hindering environmental control are the growing cocaine trade, landless peasants, rough free-lance gold miners and `` sinister bureaucracy,'' he said. <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> protection will be `` a hot potato'' for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s next president, <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who has announced wide-ranging pro-ecology measures, leaves office in March. Voters will choose his successor Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first direct presidential vote since 1960. None of the 22 presidential candidates `` has presented really serious proposals for protecting the environment,'' <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s small <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does have a presidential contender, but polls give him almost no chance of winning. <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said the institute is trying to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change a law that encourages settlement in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> region by giving land-tax discounts to settlers who absorb the expense of clearing up to 50 percent of their land. `` The idea of that law was to promote development and at the same time protect at least 50 percent of the rainforest. But what happens is that someone sells half his land, and the next guy clears 50 percent of that, and so on, until there's nothing left.'' With a $ 110 billion foreign debt, the highest in the developing world, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is open to foreign proposals for debt-for-ecology swaps, <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said, but it has n't received any.

<HEAD>Denver Council Approves Ban on Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City Council, despite heated opposition from several hundred gun owners and their supporters, approved a ban Tuesday on semiautomatic assault weapons. The ordinance passed just after midnight by a vote of 9-4. `` It's regrettable that we have to take this action because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did n't have the courage to,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, said the ordinance will take effect once it is signed by <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> and published, probably next week. The law carries penalites of $ 500 to $ 999 in fines and 10 to 120 days in jail. Residents who owned assault weapons before adoption of the ordinance will be able to keep them, but they will be required to register them within 60 days. `` Criminals are going to behave like criminals,'' said <PERSON> Councilwoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who proposed the ban. `` We have, however, made a small step to give police a tool to confiscate _ what we now publicly consider anti-social weapons, when they are found in the course of their work, and we have sent a message that these particular semiautomatic weapons are not welcome in the city and county of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I think that's the useful thing to do. It's not going to solve crime and we never said it would,'' she said. More than 700 people packed into <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s City and County Building for a public hearing Monday night. A total of 297 people signed up to speak against the proposal and 30 were in support, but some did not get the chance to speak because the hearing ended on schedule at 11 p.m. Gun enthusiasts held signs outside the chambers that read `` Ban liberals, not firearms.'' At one point during the hearing, council members threatened to leave after one speaker called Reynolds a `` rapist'' of the Constitution. The council staff turned off the microphone and the man left. Police Chief <PERSON> Aristedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavaras </PERSON> spoke in favor of the ban. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> opposed it. `` Recent research has opened new evidence that an armed public has and is a powerful deterrent to crime,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Offenders do recognize the gunowner as a potential threat to their well being.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state's two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators are on opposite sides of a dispute over whether a university mascot _ a headdress-bedecked American Indian chief _ should be discarded as offensive. Chief Illiniwek has been a symbol of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> since 1926, prancing at sporting events and emblazoning clothing, coffee mugs and other paraphernalia. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, a pre-law student at the school, began a fight last month to dump the chief, saying it was an insult to American Indians. `` There is no way we would tolerate someone dressed as an old-time black slave dancing on the field or someone portraying a Jew,'' said <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, who is from suburban <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> agreed, and joined the effort to find a new mascot. His fellow Democratic senator, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, is prepared to lead a fight to keep the mascot. Because of opposition, the university in <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION> has agreed to have cheerleaders and band members stop wearing Indian-style face makeup during games, school spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said Tuesday. But he added, `` I think it would take something very cataclysmic for the chief to be done away with.'' The chief is named for a confederacy of woodland tribes that once lived in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> is an alumnus of the university and said he is filled with `` pride for my school'' every time he sees the chief. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> acknowledged Monday during a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> visit that the chief `` is a revered figure'' to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> fans. `` But it remains a sore point for many Native Americans,'' he said. `` I would favor further discussion that could eventually lead to a new mascot for the university.'' Other schools have changed Indian mascots, including <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which several years ago changed the name of its sports teams from the Indians to the Cardinal.

During the month-long hunt in September, 222 licensed hunters caught 3,117 gators, including a 13-foot-6 monster bagged on the north side of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> and a 685-pounder from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>. The catch represents about 91 percent of the quota and compares with 2,988 caught in 1988, the first state-sanctioned alligator hunt in 26 years. Part of the reason officials renewed the hunts was the burgeoning alligator population, believed to exceed 1 million in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We're not trying to reduce the alligator population,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to have these hunts years after year.'' A study of this year's catch indicated the alligator population is generally healthy and growing well, said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Police Crack Down on Illegal Parking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Periwinkles stuffed butterflies under windshield wipers with unusual alacrity Tuesday as part of a crackdown on illegal parking, a major contributor to the city's nightmarish traffic Periwinkles are what the French fondly call their meter maids and butterflies are what, far less fondly, they call parking tickets. Traffic policemen and police auxiliaries are helping with the blitz of illegal parkers. After a brief publicity campaign notifying the public that the days of lax enforcement were over and the `` anything goes'' style of French parking had gone, authorities sprang into action Monday with tickets and tow trucks. `` It's really interfering with my work,'' said <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, a housepainter working in a central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment. `` I keep having to climb down from the ladder and stick my head out of the window every 15 minutes.'' It was worse for drivers of delivery trucks, who block narrow streets with impunity and unload their wares with majestic nonchalance at all hours despite restrictions on delivery times. `` You simply can not work in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> without breaking the law,'' one said. Another complained: `` They're not really attacking the traffic problem, they're taking it out on drivers. What they need is to build more parking places in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but that's more complicated.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is blessed with wide avenues, but they are knit together by hundreds of narrow streets that quickly become congested. Parisians, desperate for a places to leave their cars, park them on sidewalks, in crosswalks, at taxi stands. They'll even park double or triple at intersections. No one is being spared in the painful new regime. Police and Periwinkles, named for their light blue uniforms, have orders to ticket every violator, accept no excuses, accede to no pleadings. Special attention is being paid to those who park `` dangerously,'' as in bus lanes. Tow-away tickets are stuck on windows, radio calls placed and the vehicles vanish in 15 minutes. `` It's quite a shock to go out and see your car gone,'' said a journalist who parked in a taxi stand when he arrived at work Monday night. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> police said 457 vehicles were towed away Monday, compared with about 300 on a usual day. They said 10,117 parking tickets were issued, 23 percent more than the previous Monday. A ticket for parking that disrupts traffic costs 230 francs -LRB- $ 37 -RRB-. Parking in a delivery zone is worth 500 francs -LRB- $ 80 -RRB- and retrieving a vehicle from the car pound lightens the wallet by 471 francs -LRB- $ 75 -RRB-. Dangerous parking might cost a driver's license. `` Users of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> streets must appreciate the consequences of the increase in individualistic parking conduct, which is at the very least cavalier, if not outright dangerous,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Verbrugghe </PERSON> said last month. City plans call for eliminating 100,000 parking places in 10 years and creating 300 `` red streets,'' where parking will be prohibited to facilitate through traffic. How long the current heat will last is not clear. `` Before, when I was writing a ticket and the owner of the vehicle arrived, I had a tendency to let it go,'' a Periwinkle said, `` but now, we are under very strict orders. Nobody escapes.''

 A Pakistani air force plane buzzed <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Tuesday and dropped leaflets advertising a private home furnishing business _ but it was all for charity. The U.S.-built C-130 transport made several low passes over <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> as clouds of white paper fell from its open hatch. They read: `` Long Live <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ...

<TEXT>
 The insurance company for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> will have to pay court costs for the legal battle between actress <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and the symphony, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had refused to provide coverage for the symphony during its seven-year court tangle. But the state's high court found the company liable, possibly for as much as $ 1 million, which is the amount symphony attorneys say was incurred during the legal dispute. By the time the case came to a close this year, <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> had collected $ 12,000 in damages. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and her company sued the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> symphony in 1982, after the symphony canceled a series of performances of <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s `` Oedipus Rex,'' which <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> was to narrate The series was called after protests about <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and her pro-Palestinian politics. Prior to filing the lawsuit, <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s attorneys sent a warning letter to the symphony demanding an apology and asking that the performances be restored. The letter said the actress had a right to speak freely, without fear of blacklisting or discrimination and should not be publicly ridiculed. But the engagement was not revived and <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s lawsuit alleged that the symphony breached its contract with her, causing her to lose other professional engagements, among other things. <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> argued that <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s suit constituted a generic breach of contract claim. Since its policy with the symphony called for providing coverage for injuries stemming from libel, slander or other defamatory material, <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it should not be liable. The symphony sued <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. In its decision, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the claim involved broader issues and that <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was obliged to defend the symphony in the matter. Though a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court jury initially awarded her $ 100,000, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> threw out the award. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> later restored $ 12,000 of the award. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s attorneys petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear the case, but were refused.

<HEAD>Inquiry Finds Laxity at Root of 35 Rail Deaths Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laxity and dangerous standards on British Rail led to the deaths of 35 people last year in a triple train collision in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, an official inquiry reported Tuesday. Faulty wiring in the signal system was the immediate cause of the disaster during the morning rush hour Dec. 12, said Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidden </PERSON>, the judge who headed the inquiry. The fault caused a signal to remain green although a train was stopped just beyond it. In addition to the dead, more than 100 people were injured when one commuter train rammed the rear of a stopped commuter train, outside busy <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The wreckage was then struck by a freight train. Hidden said the signal failure reflected a deterioration of the `` safety culture'' in the state-owned rail system. `` The relevant errors include the facts that working practices were permitted to slip to unacceptable and dangerous standards,'' Hidden's report said. `` The quality of supervision was permitted to slip to an equivalent degree so that those unacceptable and dangerous working practices were allowed to continue.'' Among 93 recommendations to improve safety, Hidden called for priority in installing radios in the cabs of trains and installing airline-style `` black boxes,'' and more research on improving rolling stock to protect passengers in the event of an accident. Within the signals department, Hidden called for radical improvement in recruiting and training, and an end to excessive overtime. Technicians testified at a public hearing that they worked long hours and days off because of a shortage of qualified staff. After the report was released, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> resigned as quality manager for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. He was the regional signaling engineer at the time of the accident. Hidden's report said <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> made the `` dangerous assumption'' that once a problem was identified, it would be fixed. `` The problem about Mr. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s management was that it demonstrated the lack of communication which pervaded the signals and telecommunications department,'' the report said. `` I accept all the inquiry's recommendations here and now,'' said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, Sir <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>. `` We have taken steps to ensure that the circumstances that led to this tragedy can never be repeated on British Railways.'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said more than $ 32 million has been spent solving problems identified following the Clapham disaster.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying the fate of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is with him `` every single day,'' held out hope Tuesday that the return of frozen Iranian assets might help prompt <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to work for the captives' freedom. `` I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to a question about whether the plight of the hostage was tied to the disposition of Iranian assets seized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a decade ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments at a news conference came a day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would receive $ 567 million, a portion of the money frozen by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after radical students stormed the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't know if the release of the money would affect the eight Americans. `` I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials repeatedly have rejected linking the hostages' fate to the assets on the grounds the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not negotiate for captives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has appealed to pro-Iranian Moslems holding the hostages to free them on humanitarian grounds. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped actions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, a body established in 1981 to iron out financial claims and counter-claims between the two countries, could help the hostages. `` I think they -LRB- the Iranians -RRB- have made some positive statements, but I do n't know whether it will work that way or not. I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold these hostages.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the administration had run into `` dead ends'' following certain `` rabbit trails'' in behind-the-scenes efforts to free the hostages. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, the sister of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, called the release of the $ 567 million `` damned good news.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was captured in March 1985. `` I would expect the ball is in the court'' of Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, Mrs. Say said. Last month, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> offered to help get the Western hostages freed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> released frozen assets or helped settle the cases of three Iranians captured by Christian Lebanese militiamen in 1982. <PERSON> Shireen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an expert on Iranian affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank, cautioned against reading too much into the tribunal actions' in The Hague. `` It is n't really a quid pro quo,'' she said of links between the hostages and the assets. Nevertheless, the tribunal's actions are another step in `` confidence-building or mistrust-reducing'' between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, she said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the $ 567 million was the amount transferred to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> satisfied debts to American banks over the last several months. The money came from an account that contained about $ 800 million. The remainder, about $ 243 million, was put in a security account that will be used to pay off others claims to Americans. The security account must contain a minimum of $ 500 million at all times, officials said. The agreement was worked out in party by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser who met with Iranian officials in The Hague on Nov. 2 and 3, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of the arrangement that led to the release of American hostages held for 444 days in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> by militants. There are several other claims outstanding, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s demand for compensation for military equipment purchased before the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> transferred $ 9.9 billion in frozen assets to the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks' settlement this month, some $ 3.8 billion had been transferred to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 After three terms as mayor and stints as a congressman, councilman and district leader, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> could n't find his name on the ballot Tuesday. He proclaimed himself `` free at last.'' The lame-duck mayor said he got up at 5:30 a.m., put in an hour at the gym, went to a police station to `` say goodbye to the cops'' and then cast his ballot for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and the rest of the Democratic ticket. `` I feel very sanguine,'' he said outside the <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm probably the most relaxed guy in town today.'' He said he did not mind being out of the political action and accepted his loss to <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in the Democratic primary in September. `` No poignancy. No regrets. No sensitivity,'' he said. `` I have a sense of ` Free at last! Free at last! Great God Almighty! Free at last!''' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> first ran for office, unsuccessfully, in the Democratic primary for the state Assembly in 1962. He won a race for Democratic district leader in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> the next year, ousting Tammany Hall boss <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSapio </PERSON>. `` My critics _ those who have opposed me in election after election _ thought that somehow or other my life would come to an end if I were not the mayor,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` And they're dumbfounded. They're confounded, that I am going on to a new career: from a financial point of view, much more enriching.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who is paid $ 130,000-a-year as mayor, has lined up a fellowship as a lecturer on urban affairs at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a two-minute commentary on a daily morning radio talk show, a possible newspaper column, a big-bucks lecture circuit contract and what he said will probably be a TV show. He has also said he would consider `` tasteful'' commercials. However, he added, `` Obviously there's no job as good as that of being mayor. I said that all along.''

<TEXT>
 In the battle between sharks and people, it turns out that the jaws most to be feared are those of humans. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that the sharks in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> may need protection. Sharks have been overfished for a decade, resulting in a severe depletion in the western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said. Once a secondary product caught by fishermen seeking tuna and swordfish, sharks have become a sought-after seafood on their own, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurkul </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Shark meat is becoming common on American stores and shark fins are increasingly exported, she said. Feared for their voraciousness, featured in such films as `` Jaws'', sharks are slow to mature, have a long reproductive cycle and produce only a few offspring annually, officials said. So serious is the concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is taking the extraordinary step of scheduling a series of hearings over the next two months to discuss the problem and draft a management plan for the fish. The plan could include setting a commercial quota, requiring permits for commercial use and establishing recreational bag limits. That plan could go to the secretary of commerce by February and take effect by June, said Ms. <PERSON> Kurkul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mako </PERSON> is the most commonly caught and sold species of shark, but the management plan would consider some 38 species if they are found to be in danger, she said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave himself high grades Tuesday on the anniversary of his election, vowed to `` veto and exhort'' until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves his programs and brushed aside criticism that he has responded too timidly to the awakening of democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a mid-morning news conference, also expressed fresh hope <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help win the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to release $ 567 million in frozen assets to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the release of the Iranian funds would get `` underbrush cleared out.'' Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that release of the money was not linked with the hostages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the Election Day news conference by saying his administration `` has come together rapidly with good people and with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose.'' After nearly 10 months in office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I enjoy it. I like the challenge.'' Expressing satisfaction with his record in international and national affairs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had seen the greatest surge toward democracy around the world in at least 40 years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside criticism _ most recently from former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ that he has responded too cautiously to changes sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than triple the spending on every initiative,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Besides, he said, `` I do n't hear complaints coming out of our allies or, indeed, out of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Coincidentally, within an hour of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press conference, the entire East German cabinet resigned amid demands on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for reform and change in leadership. `` Things are happening very fast,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the push toward democracy has `` gone too far to irreversibly ... set back'' the progress. `` I do n't think you can contain now the peoples' aspirations for freedom by going back to totalitarianism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had originally viewed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, as a hardliner, but said that may have been premature. `` Now there are some signs that that's not the case,'' he said. Looking ahead to his meeting next month with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he remained concerned about the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s support for the revolutionary government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that other superpower differences remain. He said that to suggest `` that everything is hunky-dory simply is not reality, and that's one of the reasons I'm looking forward to this visit.'' On the domestic front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused Congress of delaying action on his proposals for clean-air legislation, an anti-drug program and ethics laws. Democrats have tried to go beyond <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals in a number of areas, and Republicans have resisted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the press and public alike to turn up the heat on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, telling lawmakers to `` take a step, get your foot in the water. Do something.'' Yet, acknowledging that his options were limited, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his strategy would be to `` exhort. What else can I do? Veto and exhort.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision to expand the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not retreat from his stand. `` I ca n't do it, and I'm sorry. I am not going to change that policy,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who supports federal funding for abortion only when the life of the mother is endangered. He dismissed the importance of abortion as a critical issue in gubernatorial elections in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, saying most voters are not swayed by a single issue and that abortion ranks only somewhere between ninth and 14th on the list of issues that voters consider important. On other points, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Refused to criticize former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for accepting a $ 2 million fee for a private visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, saying, `` I will not have anything negative to say about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' He added, `` Everybody's got to make a living.'' _ Rejected criticism from environmentalists and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who complain he is stalling efforts to combat global warming. Environmental policy `` can not be driven by the extreme,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, as more than 60 nations, acting over the opposition of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, urged the world to stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases blamed for the `` greenhouse effect.'' _ Said it is up to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to take positive steps to restore good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the aftermath of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces. `` The Chinese have a slogan: He who ties the knot should untie it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. _ Said he is `` willing to consider'' meeting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> when he visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later this month. After ending the news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the podium to rebuke militant Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for seizing a religious patriarch at his home and abusing him for endorsing a compromise political accord. He said that behavior was `` totally out of order'' and he urged that all foreign forces be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday approved a resolution supporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification of a treaty establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which have long tested nuclear weapons in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, have refused to sign agreements under the 1986 Treaty of Rarotonga. That treaty would restrict development or permanent placing of nuclear weapons in the region. The non-binding resolution, passed by voice vote, says `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> practices and activities in the region are consistent with the Treaty of Rarotonga and its protocols.'' `` It is therefore the sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should sign and ratify the protocols to that treaty.''

<HEAD>Duck Stamp Selected; Fame and Fortune for Minnesota Artist?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An acrylic painting by a 25-year-old <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> wildlife artist of two black-bellied whistling ducks was selected Tuesday to be used for the next Duck Stamp, covering the 1990-91 hunting season. The award brings prestige and financial reward to the artist, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who could earn as much as $ 1 million from commercial printings and other royalties, although the government pays no money for use of the painting. Five judges selected <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON>, who had entered the Duck Stamp competition four previous times, after they sifted through 603 entries during two days of judging at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s auditorium Well over a million of the stamps with <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON>'s design will be sold for the 1990-91 waterfowl hunting season, bringing $ 12.50 apiece to the government. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received more than $ 13 million from the sale of the stamps. Although the government sold nearly 1.4 million stamps last year, the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years. About 2.4 million stamps were sold yearly in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Oprand </PERSON>, chief of the federal Duck Stamp program, attributes the decline to the reduction of the waterfowl population. With fewer ducks there are tighter restrictions on hunting and fewer hunters to buy stamps. But the Duck Stamp, created in 1934 and produced every year since then, is much more than a source of federal revenue for the artist whose painting adorns the stamp. `` For the wildlife artist there's nothing greater than the Federal Duck Stamp,'' says <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the winner last year, who was selected in his sixth try with a painting of a pair of lesser scaup nestled amid a growth of reeds in a pond. Barred like every other winner from competing for three years, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> observed this year's competition as the judges reduced the competitors to 26 entries on the first day and narrowed on a winner Tuesday. Being selected for the Duck Stamp brings a wildlife artist instant recognition. `` You're one of a handful of people that have a piece of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. And then there are the monetary rewards. The government does not pay the artist a dime. But in recent years proceeds from the sale of prints have been lucrative, as have commissions from commercial use of the winning design on everything from T-shirts to commemorative plates. `` The artist himself should gross around $ 1 million or a million-plus,'' says <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The award transcends to the artist's other works as well, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, noting his other paintings sold more quickly and the value of his works in galleries rose 20 percent to 30 percent. `` You're not a better painter than the day before -LRB- you win -RRB-. You're just more well-known,'' he said.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines in September logged their best on-time performance since April, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The department's monthly consumer report also showed a decrease in the number of mishandled baggage complaints against airlines, but a slight increase in other complaints. The data for September showed that the 12 largest carriers reported 79.6 percent of their flights operating on time, an improvement over the 74.6 percent that operated on time in August. It was the best record since April's 83.4 percent. Mishandled baggage complaints filed against carriers averaged 7.25 reports per 1,000 passengers in September, compared with 8.19 in August, the report said. Consumer complaints against all airlines increased from 1,104 in September to 1,143 in October, the only figures available for last month.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday credited the World Series championship <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> for helping earthquake-weary <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> residents recover from `` hard and tragic times.'' In a Rose Garden ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the team as `` champions on the field and champions off it.'' In a World Series that will be most remembered for the earthquake that interrupted it for 11 days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said both the A's and their rivals, `` those equally magnificent'' <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>, `` bounced back, overcoming adversity, uniting a populace. ...'' The two teams showed `` how true pros perform when the odds are longest and the evening darkest, and the game is on the line _ the game of baseball or the larger game of life.'' The president, a first baseman and captain of his 1948 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> baseball team, was presented a baseball jersey with `` Bush'' in large black letters displayed on its front. `` We're looking for a left-hand-hitting first baseman,'' team manager <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Russa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Actually, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pitches left-handed but hits right-handed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he only wished <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Russa </PERSON> `` could help pilot my budget through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the way he piloted the A's to this World Series victory.'' `` Today we're talking baseball. And a team that is clearly and truly No. 1,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, speaking on a raw, overcast day. With the team's players lined up in business suits behind him, he added: `` big-leaguers, all, each contributing big-time to the cause.'' `` You helped the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> through some hard and tragic times,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> in a four-game sweep. But the series was abruptly interrupted after a quake measuring 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale struck at the start of game No .3. The quake killed 66 people, left thousands homeless and did billions of dollars worth of damage. Of the Earthquake Series' most valuable player, A's pitcher <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I'm just glad I'm not running for office'' against him. Addressing the whole team, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` To you we all say, well done.'' Team owner <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` baseball is our national pasttime and you're our most valuable player.'' Joked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` I'll bet it's not often that the Oakland A's are honored by an unofficial scout for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>.'' His oldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, is an owner of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> franchise.

 A propelling charge exploded during artillery testing at the <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> Proving Ground, killing two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers inside a tanklike vehicle, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> team of four soldiers was test firing the modified self-propelled M-109 howitzer at the desert base when the accident occurred Monday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said the soldiers were working on a joint project with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Two Israeli soldiers outside the howitzer were injured. They were in satisfactory condition at <ORGANIZATION> Yuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the base public affairs office said. The identities of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of relatives. <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said the propelling charge apparently exploded; the projectile and fuse were not explosive. `` The fuse and projectile were filled with sand. They were not explosive. The shell was an iron body filled with sand and the fuse was inert,'' <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. He said the shell-fuse combination weighed about 100 pounds. <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said the soldiers had fired about 70 of the 100 rounds they were scheduled to fire Monday. `` These guys were firing intermittently over the course of an eight-hour day,'' he said. The Israeli army said the accident involved an artillery piece being jointly produced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Countries buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment sometimes test the equipment at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The proving ground is in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s southwestern corner, near the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> line. The site of the accident was sealed off pending investigation. <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> declined to discuss which country was responsible for maintaining the artillery. `` That will be part of the investigation,'' he said. Because the howitzer was a prototype, investigators will have `` far more detailed'' records on its parts and maintenance, than if the accident had happened in the field, <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. The howitzer was severly damaged, <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said. He did n't know its cost and declined to discuss the specific modifications. The <ORGANIZATION> Yuma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> reported Jan. 3 that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were testing an M-109 equipped with computerized fire control and navigation systems. The systems would allow the self-propelled howitzer to automatically point its cannon at a target while keeping constant track of its own location, the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> said. The Sun also reported officials planned to increase the howitzer's firing speed to three rounds every 15 seconds from four rounds a minute by installing a new loading device that would insert the howitzer's 100-pound shell into the breech automatically. <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> said the howitzer may have been equipped with the device, called a flick rammer, `` but they were not trying for any speed records.''

 One of the changes enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in response to the savings and loan crisis may have the unintended effect of making new homes more expensive, thrift and housing executives said Tuesday. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the thrift industry's largest trade group, have identified the new restriction on loans to one borrower as a top priority in their campaign to amend <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation passed in August. The new limit is 15 percent of an institution's capital, down from 100 percent previously, a level that allowed an institution to fail because of the default of a single borrower. The lower limit was intended to break up the relationship between some builders and a few thrift executives who would fund highly speculative development projects. But, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> League President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said 15 percent is too restrictive. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said `` war stories'' are beginning to filter in from builders whose credit lines with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have been cut drastically. Home builders need large acquisition and development loans to prepare subdivision plots for sale, he said. `` I'm not talking about dollars to finance land speculation. ... There are people who have sold the lots but ca n't get the money to put in infrastructure,'' he told 3,600 delegates to the league's 97th annual convention <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> said a scarcity of development loans could increase the cost of new homes and said builders and S & amp; L executives should unite to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ease the restriction. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the home builders, said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls may eventually learn to cope with the new rule, which has applied to national banks for years, by combining in groups to make development loans or by selling shares in the loans to other institutions. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> drew cheers from the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L executives by repeating his call for lower interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to ease inflation pressures by slowing the economy with high interest rates, a policy <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> called `` a barbaric solution to the inflation equation.'' Lower interest rates are `` absolutely critical'' for making homes affordable to Americans, he said. New homes sales in September, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, plunged 14 percent, the sharpest dive in nearly eight years. However, economists appearing at a panel discussion predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would only reluctantly ease interest rates as signs of economic sluggishness emerged. `` The decade is going out with a whimper and you might get some short-term relief from high interest rates,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L trade group. Christian is predicting that construction of new homes will remain flat at about 1.4 million units in 1990 and 1991.

 Winter wheat planted this fall for the 1990 harvest is in `` mostly good to fair'' condition, but more soil moisture is needed in some areas, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday. `` Planting was 93 percent complete, four points ahead of normal'' as of the Oct. 30-Nov. 5 survey week, the report said `` Planting was complete or nearly complete in 13 of the 19 major producing states.'' However, winter wheat planting continued to lag behind normal in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` Rain was needed in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> where the crop was mostly good to fair,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the crop was mostly fair. Russian wheat aphids were a continuing problem in portions of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>.'' The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and Commerce. Its reports cover weather and crop conditions only and provides no estimates of yields or total production. This year's corn harvest was 88 percent completed by early November, 10 percentage points ahead of normal, the report said. Harvest was almost done in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, kansas, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and advanced sharply in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But the report said corn harvesting lagged behind in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, while `` near or ahead of normal'' in the other major producing states. The soybean harvest was reported 87 percent complete, 11 percentage points ahead of normal pace for this time. Farmers had completed harvesting in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and were almost done in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

 Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> began efforts to form a new government under a presidential mandate bestowed on Monday, but faces an uphill battle for success. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> has three days to organize enough support to persuade President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> he can put together a Cabinet. If he fails, former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> will be given the exploratory mandate. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came in first in elections last Sunday, but missed a parliamentary majority. It was the second time in five months Greeks went to the polls only to get an inconclusive result. A third set of elections this year is likely if no leading party can fashion a government. The standoff has delayed major decisions on the ailing economy and foreign policy. A conservative-Communist alliance formed after elections in June was empowered only to investigate allegations of scandals in <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s former administration. `` In three days I will return to the president and inform him of the results of my efforts,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference. He must marshal the support of 151 members of the 300-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to win approval of his government. New Democracy won 148 seats last Sunday, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> _ known as <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> _ won 128 and the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress won 21. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> faces tough going. <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> and the Coalition ruled out teaming with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and one of the three independents is allied with the leftists. But <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said he expected to gain the seat won by an independent environmentalist, citing a legal ambiguity that may allow his party to contest the seat in a special electoral court. He said he will not enter any alliance that will force his party to water down its program to revive the economy and seek closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was expected to appeal to the Coalition to join <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> in a government. If no coalition emerges, the president will offer the major parties the chance to form a joint administration _ a proposal supported by the Coalition. If that fails, new elections will be called. A New Democracy official, <PERSON> Ioannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaiokrassas </PERSON>, said the parties will try to avoid new elections. `` I do n't see new elections right now, for the simple reason that no ... -LRB- party -RRB- wants them, nor do the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people. Only in the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,'' he said. New Democracy and the Coalition have said they will not repeat their summer alliance as their programs are incompatible. Their government handed over to a caretaker administration in October after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> indicted <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and five of his former ministers on charges of corruption. More elections would not necessarily produce a strong government. A proportional electoral system introduced by <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year makes it difficult for any party to win a parliamentary majority. The new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> includes some celebrities. Actress and former Culture Minister <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercouri </PERSON> was re-elected on the <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> ticket. Leftist composer <PERSON> Mikis </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodorakis </PERSON>, who did the soundtrack for the film `` Zorba the Greek,'' was elected running as a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> candidate. A former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy, he announced in October he was cooperating with the conservatives in a crusade against urban terrorism. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON>, won overwhelmingly in the mountainous constituency of <LOCATION> Evritania </LOCATION>. The seat was formerly held by her husband, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON>, who was murdered by extreme-left urban guerrillas on Sept. 26.

<HEAD>Five Countries Freeze $60 Million Bank Accounts Of Drug Lord</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five foreign countries froze $ 60 million in bank accounts owned by a major narcotics trafficker, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement official said Tuesday. The official, <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, acting deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said efforts are being made to freeze an additional two or three bank accounts belonging to the same Columbian drug dealer. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> told reporters the action represents a significant advance in the war on drugs because it is an example of valuable cooperation by the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the five other nations in which the numerous bank accounts were located. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> disclosed the development during testimony before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearings held to evaluate the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's attempt to attack major drug cartels at the source in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other Latin American nations. Elaborating on his testimony after the hearing, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> declined to identify the drug dealer whose accounts were frozen or to name the countries in which the accounts were located. No American banks are believed to be involved, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` Based on information provided by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government in the last 10 days, we have been able to identify and freeze bank accounts in five countries that contain at least $ 60 million,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> told reporters. He said the accounts were not part of a money laundering-system, `` but represent savings accounts of one of the major Colombian narcotics dealers.'' `` These are accounts which we believe contain liquid assets of this particular trafficker,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the drug dealer is being sought by law enforcement authorities. `` I think this development demonstrates international cooperation,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` The Colombian authorities developed this information in real time and gave it to us. And several other countries cooperated in turn to freeze these funds. I think that's very significant. `` We are striking at the heart of these trafficking syndicates by confiscating their money and goods,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in his prepared testimony. He noted that earlier this year the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and other federal and foreign law enforcement agencies conducted a joint operation dubbed `` Operation Polar Cap'' which closed down a money-laundering enterprise that handled some $ 1.2 billion in illicit drug profits belonging to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. `` Operation Polar Cap resulted in the seizure of more than one ton of cocaine, the confiscation of $ 92 million in cash, jewelry and real estate and the indictment of 127 individuals,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Tuesday that a planned $ 9 billion system for jamming enemy radar `` has problems,'' and that a major review has been ordered to determine whether the program will proceed. The program came under fire in September when Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., called it a `` potential waste of billions of dollars'' and quoted <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> documents that called the system `` marginally operationally effective. The Airborne Self-Protection <PERSON> Jammer </PERSON> will deceive or jam enemy radar and will be carried aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter planes, including the F-14, F-18, F-16 and AV-8B. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> planned to produce 2,369 of the jammers at a total cost of $ 9.4 billion over the expected 20-year life of the program. So far, $ 681 million has been spent. Aircraft are to be equipped with electronic warfare systems that use a radar-warning receiver to alert a pilot when the airplane is being tracked by enemy radar. It also sends out signals to confuse enemy missiles or radar, creating false targets or giving opponents the idea that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes are n't where they seem to be. Many electronic warfare systems are in use and determined to be satisfactory, but the services are pursuing the new system in the expectation of growing technological threats. `` It has problems,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> told reporters when he was asked about the system. But he declined to go into detail, saying only that the system had `` performance, reliability'' problems. Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> and the undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Betti </PERSON>, are `` engaged in the problem,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` Where we stand now is that there has been a memorandum that calls for a review of the program after a one-year period,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> then will decide whether to continue the program. Meanwhile, he said, a limited production of 100 units has been ordered. `` Work is being done on this, and we hope to get this thing on track,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, nominated to be assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that support for the system remains strong despite problems. `` I'm told it's the most effective system that we currently have for our deployed forces and the office of the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> is standing behind the program,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources who spoke on condition they not be identified, the program is four years behind its original production start date. The source said that the delays were due in some measure to `` updated threat intelligence'' information and a decision to delay development to upgrade the system. The Pentagon inspector general and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> are reviewing the decision to proceed with the program, the source said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an article published Tuesday that `` we do n't do a good job of evaluating jammer performance,'' and that problems with the program's flawed test methods and equipment can be overcome. The source said a joint <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> group has been formed to improve those testing procedures and that the effort is expected to be completed by the end of the year. In a report released in September, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the test equipment used by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to determine the effectiveness of the radar-warning receivers and other electronics on tactical fighters was faulty and unreliable. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the problems undermined the combat readiness of the aircraft and attributed the problems to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition process, in which it bought test sets before determining whether they would work properly.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials broader power to conduct searches in foreign countries. The justices were told in a case involving a notorious Mexican drug-smuggling operation that the Constitution gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents more leeway when they investigate away from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said Fourth Amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches were not designed `` to protect rights in every quarter of the globe.'' He described as `` zaniness'' any constitutional interpretation that would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to get a warrant from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judge before searching a home in another country. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON>, representing an alleged high-ranking drug dealer, said the high court should not authorize `` a raiding party'' on foreign soil. `` If a warrant is required, -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents -RRB- must either get one or they must not search,'' he said. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> questioned what judge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have authority to issue a warrant to search a foreign residence. `` Where do you go?'' he asked. `` You call warrant central?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents without a warrant in 1988 searched the home of <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mexicali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year of taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, identified as a top lieutenant to Mexican drug kingpin <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life and is not eligible for parole for 59 years, when he would be 96. But his conviction in the murders is not at issue in the case argued Tuesday that is expected to yield a high court ruling by July. The issue is whether the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> properly suppressed evidence the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> found when it searched <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> had been arrested two years earlier by Mexican police and was turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the power of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials, particularly <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents, to help in foreign investigations is at stake. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has offices in 45 nations and last year helped in investigations that it said led to 1,200 arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign countries. The search of <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s home was conducted in conjunction with Mexican police. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> argued that even if the Fourth Amendment applies to foreign searches by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents, the search of <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s home was reasonable and did not violate the suspect's rights. <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> said the search was unreasonable. For example, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents were cooperating with a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> police officer they knew had a history of taking bribes and the searchers by mistake first went to the wrong house. Requiring a search warrant is designed to prevent such abuses, he said. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.

 Prosecutors say they will appeal a judge's decision to drop a child-abuse charge against the mother of a baby born addicted to cocaine. <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said he based the dismissal on an earlier case that determined <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s child-abuse laws do not apply to a fetus.

Ms. <PERSON> Gethers </PERSON> remains in jail, serving an 18-month sentence for violating probation she received for an earlier conviction for possession of cocaine. Her attorney, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, said she may be released in one to three months. `` She wants to get her baby back, get a job and get counseling,'' he said. She was arrested in February and charged with child abuse after she and her baby daughter were found to be cocaine-dependent. No woman has been convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of child abuse as a result of harm she caused her baby by using cocaine during pregnancy. The State Attorney's Office said it prosecuted Ms. <PERSON> Gethers </PERSON> because she also gave birth in February 1988 to a cocaine-dependent son and was counseled at that time on the dangers of using cocaine while pregnant.

 A fungus from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is showing up well as a natural killer of destructive grasshoppers that threaten crops and rangeland, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, director of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Grasshopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, said preliminary laboratory experiments indicated that the fungus _ Entomophaga praxibuli _ can infect and kill a broad range of the pesky hoppers. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that if the fungus proves out, it could help lessen the need for chemicals to control the pests. The project plan is to integrate the fungus with research demonstrations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> next year. `` The fungus only affects grasshoppers,'' the agency said. `` Laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater than any found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus causes no harm to other insects and does not affect humans or other mammals.'' Scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an outbreak in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1985. `` The dry climatic conditions in the <LOCATION> Wanwibinda </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, where this fungus was discovered, are similar to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infect millions of acres,'' the agency said.

Investigators identified the works only as seven paintings by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, one <PERSON> Brueghel </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Odilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Redon </PERSON>, three lesser-known 19th-century works and a bust by sculptor <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was spending the weekend in <LOCATION> Megeve </LOCATION> when the theft occurred in the <PERSON> Basse </PERSON> <PERSON> Californie </PERSON> section of <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. Police said Tuesday they found a hole made in the fence surrounding the estate, but no other signs of a break-in. The burglar alarm did not go off and none of the five guard dogs interfered, police said. One guard was on vacation and the other had gone shopping, leaving the house empty. Art experts said the items stolen were too well-known to be sold on the art market by any serious collector or dealer.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> surgeons are learning trauma treatment skills at a Watts-based hospital that has one of the busiest emergency rooms in the country tending to the carnage of gang gunshot victims. The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a motion to expand the presence of military physicians at beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> into other areas, including obstetrics and pediatrics. The county-run hospital has been under fire and its director was recently removed following reports that it was understaffed and underfunded. Tuesday's motion by Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whose district includes the hospital, calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a proposal within two weeks for expanding the military physician training program. Army doctors usually receive their trauma surgery training at public hospitals near their home bases. But military officials say that the young surgeons rarely see the kinds of gaping, multiple wounds caused by automatic and semiautomatic gunfire, like those common to gang shootings here, where more than 353 gang-related slayings were reported last year. A pair of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> resident physicians from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> recently completed a two-month training program at <LOCATION> King-Drew </LOCATION>, where officials say gang mayhem creates a virtual steady stream of gunshot victims. `` Here, you'll see a case where a .22 -LRB- - caliber gun -RRB- accidentally discharged,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON>, chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Tuesday `` But at King, the typical shooting was a victim shot multiple times by someone trying to kill them with larger caliber and more bullet holes in the patients.'' The 430-bed hospital treated almost 3,500 trauma victims in 1988 _ nearly 40 percent of the county's trauma patients, hospital officials said. County health officials estimate doctors there treat more than 100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month. <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON> said he got the idea to send military physicians to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last year after Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, chief of trauma and surgery at <LOCATION> King-Drew </LOCATION>, attended a trauma conference at <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> and gave a talk on the situation at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hospital. `` I said, ` This is a place where we should be sending some of our residents and staff,''' <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON> recalled. A telephone call to <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s office on Tuesday was not immediately answered. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, a fourth-year resident at <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, completed his two-month stint in trauma surgery at <LOCATION> King-Drew </LOCATION> last week. He said Tuesday in a telephone interview that while he did see several gunshot victims, only a few were suffering from high velocity weapon wounds of the type inflicted by military-type weapons. `` There were nights that were extremely busy. About two Saturdays ago, it got really busy. That was the night I got called in on my time off. There was a guy walking around with a .45, shooting people,'' <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> said. County health officials said the pilot program may be expanded and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of their surgical training. <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON> said <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> told him that `` while the experience was excellent, he also felt he was providing a service as well.'' In addition to the two doctors from <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> surgeon from <ORGANIZATION> Fitzsimmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, trained at <ORGANIZATION> King-Drew </ORGANIZATION>. Two more surgeons from <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> and two more from <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> are scheduled to train at the hospital over the next year.

 The Iran-Contra prosecutor urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to issue a transcript of a closed hearing in the case of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, court that a censored version of the transcript from the Aug. 23 hearing should be made public because much of the testimony is n't potentially damaging to national security <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers prevailed on the court to close a portion of that hearing dealing with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> aimed at protecting the country against a possible invasion by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In a court filing, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said intelligence agencies had authorized him to disclose that information and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved its disclosure at public trial. But the department said the information, contained in documents prepared by the government, still was considered classified for purposes of oral argument. Even federal law protecting classified information `` implies that the Attorney General may not certify the closure of an entire hearing where only a ` portion' of that hearing risks disclosure of classified information,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` Thus, while the Attorney General has authority to close an argument because of the likelihood that classified information will be disclosed, the Attorney General has no authority ... to prohibit access to a redacted, unclassified transcript,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s court filing was in support of five organizations _ <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> _ that have filed a motion for access to a redacted transcript. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is charged with obstructing the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general and making false statements in the Iran-Contra affair. He allegedly assisted White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra re-supply operation. His trial is delayed while the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decides whether it wants to appeal a ruling that the attorney general may not intervene in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case with court appeals to protect classified information. The ruling leaves Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> with the option of allowing certain classified information to be divulged at <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s trial or filing an affidavit barring its disclosure. Filing an affidavit could scuttle the prosecution.

<HEAD>EPA May Exclude Too Many Waste Sites from Superfund, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT T. GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> may be improperly excluding up to 2,000 hazardous waste sites from its Superfund cleanup program and deliberately limiting the number of cases it will handle, according to testimony Tuesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` EPA's requirement to meet statutory guidelines and its desire to reduce its tremendous workload is causing the site reject rate to steadily increase,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> told the Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources. Witnesses at the hearing said that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s system for identifying sites that would qualify for Superfund and federal aid for 90 percent of the cleanup cost is inadequate because it relies heavily on information from state and local governments. State governments sometimes are reluctant to report sites for Superfund cleanup because states must pay 10 percent of the bill, witnesses said. To hold down costs, states have settled with the polluters, often resulting in a less expensive, less reliable cleanup, according to testimony. States also have not told <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> about some sites, forgoing federal funds, because they thought <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> cleanup was too time-consuming, said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON>. The cost of cleaning up an average Superfund site runs from $ 21 million to $ 30 million, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimated last year. The Superfund has a $ 10.1 billion authorization for 10 years beginning in 1986, subject to actual appropriations of funds from year to year. <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure because of the high costs and heavy caseload, is ruling out too many sites too early and with too little information. In a report released last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> calculated that from 246 to 2,000 sites may have been excluded from Superfund that should have been included. The estimate was derived from a number of studies and data and did not refer to specific sites. The General Accounting Office estimates that there are from 130,000 to 425,000 potential hazardous waste sites in the country. There are, however, only 31,000 known or suspected hazardous waste sites on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s list of candidates for Superfund cleanup. The agency has 1,219 sites on a priority list for cleanup under Superfund. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> concedes that it is ruling out more sites for Superfund but maintains that it is doing a better job on site decisions and is devoting more staff time to that task. `` Yes, we've processed more, but we've made better decisions,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Longest </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> and Remedial Response. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. and chairman of the subcommittee, alleged that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was pursuing a policy of deferring enforcement decisions to the states even though the agency officially had discarded that approach `` By consciously limiting the number of sites which will be addressed through the Superfund program, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is continually shifting more and more cleanup responsibilities to other Federal programs which have fewer financial resources and safeguards, and to states which are struggling to cope with the problems they already face,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. Last December, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> asked for comment on a proposed policy of turning over control of Superfund sites to states. The outcry was so great that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> disbanded the working group studying the issue. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant administrator for Solid Waste and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repsonse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, said the agency was working within the constraints imposed by budgets and the law, which requires a certain deference to state agencies. `` Our job is to prioritize and to do the best job that we can,'' said Cannon.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected criticism from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and environmentalists who say he's stalling efforts to combat global warming Environmental policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` can not be driven by the extreme.'' The president's defense came as three senators chastized his administration for not endorsing a resolution sought by many European countries at a global warming conference in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The resolution calls for specific curbs on `` greenhouse'' gases by the end of the century. The White House issued a statement later Tuesday saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed on a compromise declaration at the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> conference that says global warming pollutants should be stabilized `` as soon as possible.'' According to administration sources, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators felt they could accept that wording because it does n't tie any nation to specific levels of pollution reduction nor stabilize levels by a specific year. The revised declaration notes only that `` in the view of many industrialized nations'' _ but not necessarily all nations _ carbon dioxide emissions should be stabilized by 2000, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, asking that he not be identified. `` We're not willing to agree to a set time. We did not sign on to anything mentioning the year 2000,'' said deputy presidential press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Originally, many of the conference participants had sought commitments to freeze greenhouse gas emissions at present levels by 2000, a position the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has rejected. That prompted sharp criticism from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and environmentalists. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to confront the greenhouse effect. Now what we're seeing is the whitewash effect,'' Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said in remarks on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was criticized by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who wants to be the environmental president, promised to lead us on this issue -LRB- of global warming -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` But he's leading us in the wrong direction _ backward.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked about the issue at a White House news conference, defended his strategy of moving slowly in making a commitment to specific reductions in greenhouse gases. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific community, he said, `` is in the lead'' in focusing on the question of what effect pollutants, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, will have on world temperatures over the next 50 years. `` But you ca n't take a policy and drive it to the extreme and say to every country around the world -LRB- that -RRB- you are n't going to grow -LRB- economically -RRB- at all,'' the president said. The administration has been divided for months on how aggressively it should pursue specific commitments to getting worldwide reductions in global warming pollutants, especially carbon dioxide, of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest source. A major concern among some presidential advisers has been over cost. Significant reductions of greenhouse pollutants will require curbing the use of fossil fuels, meaning more fuel-efficient automobiles and increased energy conservation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe in a reduction of carbon dioxide. But we're not prepared to say by what time and by what level,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said as the conference opened Monday. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has said repeatedly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes it's too early to commit to specific curbs of greenhouse gases and that such matters are best worked out by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> in a series of meeting beginning in February <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, on Tuesday compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude toward dealing with global warming with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight-year opposition to dealing with acid rain. Conceding pollution curbs could be costly, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that `` delay has a cost of its own.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., two of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest advocates for immediate action to combat global warming, accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of reneging on a campaign promise to address the issue <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said the administration `` is clearly out of the mainstream'' on global warming and has has demonstrated at the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> conference that it's `` not a leader but a delinquent partner.'' `` The overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that we are changing our atmosphere, the world is getting warmer and we ought to move now,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. `` It is not a question of if the globe is warming, but how much and how fast.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedoruk </PERSON>, a spokesman for Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest contributor to the release of global warming gases `` and should be leading efforts to solve the problem.'' `` Instead, this country allied itself with some of the world's biggest polluters to stymie meaningful action,'' <PERSON> Fedoruk </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Bush Says Abortion Not His Most Important Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that there's room in politics for differing viewpoints on abortion and that the issue is `` absolutely not'' the most important one for him. On an election day when the issue of a woman's right to an abortion figured as a major theme in gubernatorial campaigns in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he does not believe voters cast their ballots based on that issue alone. `` I do n't believe most voters are single-issue voters. There is no evidence to support that, none at all,'' he said, citing data by his campaign pollster, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, showing that voters consider abortion the ninth to 14th most important issue before them. `` I think our party is broad enough to contain differing views on this ... and I think the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House news conference. `` It's so personal. I just come down more on the side of life. ... Look, I do n't fault people who view this differently. There's plenty of room for difference.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments brought quick reaction from a leading pro-choice advocate on Capitol Hill. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., said it appeared the president was attempting to moderate his views, and was `` trying to distance himself from the radical, anti-choice platform on which he ran. She said also that `` he's got a bit of a mini-revolution going on'' among pro-choice Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the meantime, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and activist groups that want abortions outlawed have hammered on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because they are suspicious that he is not as strongly committed to their cause as his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Acknowledging the heated opinions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared told reporters, `` Abortion divides.'' But he also said, `` We have room in our party for people that feel one way _ pro-life or pro-choice; <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the same way.'' Nationwide activism by pro-choice supporters has put an increasingly bright spotlight on the abortion controversy since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in July giving states increased powers to legislate on abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted he has `` no intention of changing my position.'' `` Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was wrong to think abortion was not a top priority among voters. `` He's going to find it out ... in 1990. And, if he stays on a collision course with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, he'll find it out personally in 1992.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently vetoed the $ 157.6 billion package for the departments of Education, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> because it included an abortion-financing provision written by <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>. The provision would have expanded the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for rape or incest victims, going beyond current law, which allows Medicaid funds to be spent only in cases where the mother's life is endangered. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has vowed to veto a $ 14.4 billion foreign aid bill for fiscal 1990 because it would send $ 15 million to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund. The agency carries on programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where its opponents say severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced abortions and sterilizations. `` It supports compulsory abortion,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> program. `` I am not going to do that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented as voters in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> went to the polls to elect governors after campaigns that dwelt heavily on the candidates' positions on abortion. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, Democratic gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> attacked Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in a series of TV ads for his stance against the right to an abortion. The abortion controversy continued to erupt nationwide as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> saying Tuesday in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> that no Catholic can responsibly take a pro-choice stand on abortion, and they urged public officials to fight the right to an abortion.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday she is keeping silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy `` whichever way I go,'' and detract from her work on illiteracy, the homeless, hunger and AIDS. `` I think that should be left to the people who are courageous enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do something about it,'' she told three reporters at a White House reception for disabled award winners. Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections _ notably the governor's races Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ she said that she is not a `` single-issue'' person and indicated voters should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter. `` I think people ought to be thinking about fiscal responsibility and past records and ... looking at the man as a whole or the woman as a whole,'' she said. `` I'm not a single issue man or woman,'' she said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday that he believes Americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion. He recently vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest. Asked why she will not give her own position on abortion, which has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July decision giving states greater leeway to restrict it, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` It does nothing but cause controversy whichever way I go. I want people to be interested in my projects,'' such as working for literacy and the homeless. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced in February that she would not speak out on controversial policy issues, after she told a reporter that she favored a ban on semi-automatic weapons, putting her in conflict with her husband's public position. The first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to teen-age women, and says, `` We need a lot of education, to tell these girls that there are opportunities out there for them, that the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies. It's very old fashioned, I know.'' After the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in July gave states expanded powers to restrict abortion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lauded the ruling and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only, `` I go with my president.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that she would like to go to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> superpower summit next month if Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, also goes. She said it had not been decided if she would go, but that `` I'm one who loves to travel. On another issue, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said her eyes are still irritated from the thyroid condition she suffers known as Graves Disease. She said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the ailment, prednisone, has made her gain back some of the weight she lost earlier in the year. `` I'm fighting a small problem, weight,'' she conceded, adding that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape. Then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at an event designed to honor people who have overcome major disabilities. `` Of all the places in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to complain about taking prednisone, this is not the party to complain about it,'' she said as she stood among several wheelchair-bound award recipients.

 Twenty-eight inspectors check the safety of shipments of hazardous chemicals that cross the country by rail _ too few to ensure federal safety regulations are being obeyed, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. `` It's like trying to stop an elephant with a fly swatter,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief transportation expert, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` You try to stop all these tank cars and there's another 500,000 cars right behind them. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said that there's no way the federal government can afford to hire enough inspectors to look at all 1.1 million rail carloads of hazardous chemicals which move each year but that `` a doubling of this workforce would be reasonable.'' `` There is simply too much of a workload on these people,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in a report to be issued next week, concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has n't done a good job of running the government's hazardous materials inspection program. The agency is authorized to have 34 inspectors, but only 28 of those positions are filled, and the people filling the slots have an average age of 50, <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials. That means `` we're going to have some attrition soon,'' decreasing the pool of experienced inspectors, he said. In addition, he said inspectors have n't been going after high-risk shippers and railroads and have n't received adequate guidance about their procedures because there's been no direction from the top. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, the new head of the railroad administration, told the panel the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> accurately described shortcomings and `` we'd be wise to include'' the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s report in discussions of ways to improve the way the FRA does its job Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., called the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusions `` a truly frightening picture of the dangers to which our citizenry is exposed on a daily basis. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> blamed the problem on `` a long-slumbering bureaucracy that grew cold and complacent during an eight-year dismantling of federal safety activities.'' `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration left its successors an unforgiveable legacy of mismanagement and inefficiency, and then made sure ther were n't enough resources to clean up the mess,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, called the 4 billion tons a year of harzardous chemicals transported in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> a `` potential <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> on wheels,'' in a reference to the fatal 1984 release of methylisocyanate that killed 3,403 people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> has introduced a comprehensive bill dealing with the movement of hazardous materials and increasing the number of federal rail inspectors, with their salaries paid through first-ever federal registration fees.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill Tuesday that would expand Everglades National Park in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by 110,000 acres to protect it from encroaching commercial development. Established in 1947, the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> park preserves the subtropical region at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southern tip. Certain water quality and flows must exist to maintain the park's extensive freshwater and saltwater ecosystems. Increasing development in the region has affected the waterways and hurt plant and animal populations. For example, the number of wading birds has declined by 93 percent, naturalists say. The bill, which was passed on voice vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to acquire lands and interest in land through donation, purchase or exchange. The state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has said it would donate 35,000 acres. Under the bill, it must pay 20 percent of the cost of acquiring the remaining 75,000, with the federal government spending 80 percent. The addition would amount to about 7.9 percent of the park's current area, 1,398,937 acres The measure would prohibit most use of airboats in the park, but people who were using them on Jan. 1 could contiue to use them under rules to be adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The bill directs the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to modify water delivery to the park, based on the findings of an experimental program authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. The corps also would construct flood control and drainage works in areas adversely affected by the modifications. Property owners would be compensated if their crops or lands were damaged. In another provision of the measure, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is to submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a feasibility study for redesignating the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> Dry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tortuga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off Key West, as a national park. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that the bill wpould require spending of $ 79 million over the next five years.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor urged senators Tuesday to reject the nomination of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cousin as a federal appeals judge, saying the appointment would violate the nation's anti-nepotism law `` He would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the president's cousin,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 48, is a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The committee is not expected to vote for several weeks on whether to recommend confirmation by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Such a delay is normal and the nomination has not drawn opponents other than <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` got this appointment because of family connections,'' <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said, alleging that it `` violates the anti-nepotism statute both in language and in spirit.'' The 1967 law bars naming relatives to government jobs. <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said he believes it applies to the Walker nomination but told reporters in a hallway afterward that there was room for disagreement on that point. He said that even if the law does not apply to a judicial nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` violates the spirit of the law.'' The elegantly dressed <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who bears a remote resemblance to his cousin, sat a few feet away with an impassive expression most of the time as <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> described him as an `` average'' judge. Once he shook his head impatiently during <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON>'s testimony. <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> once held an improper conversation with an attorney in a lawsuit stemming from the <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON> society murder trial. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> denied the allegation.

 A white man who said he shot a black panhandler out of fear for his life was given a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor homicide charge. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, was also placed on probation for two years in the 1986 shooting death of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 42. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> fired when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> approached a pickup driven by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at a red light in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s 1987 trial ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of convicting him of the same charge he pleaded guilty to Monday in a plea bargain at <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Couty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The sentence drew criticism Tuesday from attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penick </PERSON>, who is representing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s brother in a $ 4 million wrongful death suit against <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The civil lawsuit is pending. <PERSON> Penick </PERSON> said he was `` outraged and disturbed'' by what he considered a `` very light sentence, certainly in comparison to the nature of the crime.'' `` It is precisely a <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> case,'' said <PERSON> Penick </PERSON>. `` In fact, it is more heinous than that case in the sense there was no allegation that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was trying to rob Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. He was merely asking for a quarter. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who shot four young black men on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway in December 1984, said he feared he was about to be robbed. He was cleared of attempted murder and assault charges but was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $ 500 for illegal gun possession. In the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Penick </PERSON> said the prosecution and sentence would have been harsher if the unarmed victim had been white and the gunman black. `` I know both the judge and the district attorney to be fair persons, but I do not understand how they came to agree on this particular sentence,'' he said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, deputy district attorney, denied any racial motivation behind the plea bargain with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. He said the prosecution had problems finding witnesses, and noted that a 1987 jury deadlocked with 10 wanting to convict <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of no more than criminally negligent homicide. The other two jurors favored a more serious manslaughter conviction. `` Based on the evidence we felt we could put on with the witnesses we had, the age of the case and the jury voting the way they did before,'' <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> said, it seemed better to make the offer to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> contended he shot <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because he feared for his life. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had approached him previously and when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> refused to give him money, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to take the keys from the ignition of his vehicle. On the day he shot <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> approached him yelling, `` I remember you! I remember you!'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he fired a warning shot at the ground, then fired again when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kept advancing. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been on non-paid leave from his job as a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service mechanic since the shooting. One of his attorneys said he now will start the process of getting reinstated. `` I'm glad it's over,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said outside the courtroom.

 An explosion and fire ripped through a recreation center in the resort town of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION> Tuesday, injuring 25 children and two firemen.

<TEXT>
 Fourteen activist AIDS groups on Tuesday urged an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> drug manufacturer to cut the price of a drug used to prevent a form of pneumonia that is the biggest killer of people with AIDS. The coalition, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said the price of about $ 100 for a monthly dose of aerosolized pentamidine is too expensive for many people with AIDS or infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The groups said that while recognizing that pricing is based on more than just the research and development costs of a particular drug, `` the ultimate price must also be within reason and should not deny access to thousands.'' They noted that `` unreasonably high prices borne by the federal government for these therapies through Medicaid and other federal programs may spur calls for broader regulation of drug prices.'' The groups asked for a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss pricing of aerosolized pentamidine, which the company markets as NebuPent. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> officials were out of the office Tuesday afternoon and could not be reached for comment. The aerosol version of pentamidine was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in June. Federal health officials recommended aggressive use of the therapy that protects people infected with AIDS from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills more than 60 percent of people with AIDS. A similar coalition of AIDS activists had earlier pressed for a price cut by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes AZT, the only government-approved drug that attacks the AIDS virus. In September, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> announced a 20 percent reduction in the wholesale price of AZT, cutting the cost of an annual course of treatment from about $ 8,000 to about $ 6,500. Among the groups signing the letter were <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, People with <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and Gay Men's Health Crisis.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will begin exchanging information about their chemical-weapon arsenals next month and likely will conduct trial inspections in May, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. The exchange of data and inspections are initial steps toward a treaty to sharply reduce and possibly eliminate the weapons. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for production bans in recent speeches to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, attending an arms control seminar at Wye Plantation on the Eastern Shore of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, estimated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles at about 30,000 tons. The official, who spoke to reporters under rules that barred identifying him, said the Soviet's claim of possessing 50,000 tons of poison gas was widely understated. He said their arsenal could be five or six times as big. The superpowers, apparently working without major disagreements, hope they can reach an accord that will prompt 40 nations meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to adopt a worldwide ban. Another 27 countries are attending the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks as observers. Those countries include <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and several others suspected of having chemical weapons programs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official estimated 20 to 25 nations have mastered the technology to produce chemical weapons and that about half actually possess them. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have acknowleged chemical weapons stockpiles. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official have said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both used poison gas in their <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was accused of nearing production at a plant near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the Soviets have proposed exchanging information Dec. 20 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suggested Dec. 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Soviets, meanwhile, proposed a single inspection in May of either a production or storage facility. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suggested an inspection of both types of facilities, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The inspections, which the Soviets call `` visitations,'' would be conducted by monitors from the other country. On another point, the Soviets have proposed drawing up a list of 60 countries whose approval of a treaty would trigger the complete elimination of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet chemical weapons, the official said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seeking a more air-tight arrangement, wants all countries in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to approve a ban. Until they do, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would retain 2 percent of its chemical weapons, all of them the modern binary type still in production. Despite these differences, `` we find the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions, very close,'' the official said in an optimistic account of ongoing negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 Fishermen have rescued 35 survivors of a typhoon that ravaged the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and about 70 bodies have been recovered, including seven from a capsized U.S.-owned ship, reports said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy said its ships would take aboard the survivors found by fishing boats but it did not know if any of the victims were from the Seacrest oil-drilling ship. The Seacrest, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, had 97 crewmen aboard when it capsized Saturday as Typhoon Gay roared across the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> reported that six crewmen were rescued and the bodies of seven have been recovered from the accident about 270 miles south of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and local officials reported 400 Thai fishermen are still missing along with 84 <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> crewmen. The navy said the storm sank at least 63 fishing boats. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. Suravut Maharom reported warships recovered 17 bodies from the gulf, east of <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION>, since beginning the search Monday and 30 bodies were found washed ashore on a <LOCATION> Chumphon </LOCATION> province island. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said search teams aboard company helicopters found 16 bodies and they were recovered by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> boats Tuesday. She said she did not know if any of the 16 were from the <LOCATION> Seacrest </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers on Monday removed a seventh body from the 5,373-ton oil - and gas-drilling ship, which was upside-down in the water A <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> news release said, `` We have no plans to give up the search effort.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 31 people on land were killed by the typhoon but the governor of <PERSON> Chumphon </PERSON> placed the death toll in his province alone at 71. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> identified six of the <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> crewmen who perished and whose bodies were recovered as <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Seliger </PERSON>, the West German captain of the vessel; <PERSON> Delvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Irby </PERSON>, a drill worker from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolen </PERSON>, an assistant driller from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> field engineer, and <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> crewmen <PERSON> Anan </PERSON> <PERSON> Charoensuksomboon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Munard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moowangohareen </PERSON>. Hometowns were not given. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s local subsidiary said four of the bodies were found in the ship's wheehouse and the other two in the water. Most of the <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON>'s crew crew were Thais but there also were seven Americans aboard. No American is known to have survived. <PERSON> Chalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Duangpakdee </PERSON>, one of the Thai survivors, told the <ORGANIZATION> Bangkok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, `` All I remember is the sound of swirling wind, the darkness, the rain, the waves. And every now and then, the screams for help.'' The kitchen worker said when an alarm sounded to abandon ship he grabbed a life jacket, jumped into the sea with many other crew members and managed to secure himself with rope inside a life raft. He said after several hours he was picked up by a fishing boat. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> reported survivors said all of the crew abandoned ship except the captain and three men who remained in the wheelhouse. The <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> capsized in the <LOCATION> Platong </LOCATION> field, one of several being explored for natural gas by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>.

 The House on Tuesday approved a $ 3.4 billion program for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990, including provisions designed to crack down on alcohol abuse among merchant seamen. The bill, approved 383-3 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, contains several provisions that address the Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> last spring. The House was to vote Wednesday on another bill expedited by the Exxon accident _ oil spill liability. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> measure would require the agency to review the criminal records of applicants for new or renewed licenses, registrations and other needed documents. If there's enough evidence of alcohol abuse, the agency could withhold papers until the problem is corrected.

<HEAD>Geologist Says National Detection System Would Provide Early Quake

 A national early warning system for earthquakes could provide emergency planners with crucial extra seconds in a disaster, a seismologist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey said Tuesday. The federal agency has proposed a national network of 150 interconnected seismometers to detect ground motion and relay immediate information about earthquakes, including predictions of when and where the most shaking will occur. The network would issue bulletins telling emergency planners how many seconds they had before shock waves from the quake would reach them. Those seconds could be enough to turn off power systems, issue public warnings and make emergency response plans before communications are cut off, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> of the geological survey's office in asadena, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The bulletins would help planners know where emergency services would be needed most and provide an estimate of what kind of damage the quake would cause. The network also would estimate the probability that an earthquake is a foreshock and would be followed by another, bigger quake, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said in a briefing for science writers at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said early warning systems are used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to predict tidal waves after an earthquake and to turn off gas and transportation systems when a quake occurs. One system shuts down <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high-speed `` bullet train'' to prevent an accident if the train's tracks were bent in an earthquake. Although there are 1,600 seismograph stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they are intended to locate earthquakes _ even very small ones _ and not to provide information about them. The existing system records only the up and down motion of the earth, not its side-to-side shaking, and can measure only a limited range of shock waves, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. Major quakes, like last month's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake, are off the scale. The existing system is also very slow, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. The information it provides is typically one or two days behind, and in a large sequence of shocks that delay could become as long as several months. <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said a detection system would not have reduced deaths in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake but might have been able to reduce some injuries by giving people enough warning to get out of the way of falling objects. `` We need to use whatever creative strategies there are to minimize the risk,'' he said. After the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, three seismometers were installed to measure aftershocks from the quake. The seismometers sent about a 20-second warning of aftershocks to emergency workers who were digging through rubble. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to fund 60 of the centers recommended by the geological survey in the eastern and central part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at a cost of about $ 5 million. No funding has yet been found for the remaining centers, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. `` Many people have the impression that whatever can be done is being done,'' <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. `` That is far from the true situation.'' <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>'s talk was part of a four-day briefing at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sponsored by the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.

 Soldiers killed a 13-year-old Palestinian during a violent protest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and a police commander recommended dismissal of six policemen involved in the fatal shooting of another youth. Also Tuesday, the army announced it had broken up a ring of Moslem fundamentalists believed responsible for the slayings of two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities was found stabbed to death in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Another Palestinian died in apparent infighting between militant groups in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. An army communique meanwhile reported an air raid Tuesday on targets of the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mazraat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ayn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Busiwar </LOCATION>, 14 miles inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` All targets were hit and our planes returned safely,'' it said. Reporters in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said at least two Israeli helicopter gunships were involved. The communique said nothing of casualties or damage. In southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said no casualty count was available. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gave no reason for the raid, but military officials have accused <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas of trying to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and of taking part in attacks in the border area. The 13-year-old boy was killed by a rubber bullet after paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> fired in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> to stop rioting, the army said. Residents identified him as <PERSON> Mowaeya </PERSON> <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> and said at least three other Palestinians were wounded. Witnesses said trouble began when hundreds of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> residents, many of them children, tried to march to the home of <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s cousin, who was shot and killed by soldiers a day earlier while trying to escape to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> The army said 10 <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> youths were arrested and that some wore masks. At a nearby army base, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was fatally wounded when a fellow trooper's pistol accidentally discharged, an army spokesman said. He said the accident occurred as soldiers of the Golani infantry brigade were examining their weapons prior to a patrol in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. At least 612 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since the uprising against occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began 23 months ago. In addition, 142 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Palestinians, most for allegedly collaborating with Israeli authorities. Forty Israelis have died. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said the national police commissioner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, was reviewing a recommendation that six police officers be fired in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Palestinian last month. An inquiry was launched after Israeli newspapers quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses as saying <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Daamseh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> was fatally shot Oct. 26 and did not die during a car chase, as the police claimed. The officers' commander recommended a criminal investigation, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said preliminary findings indicated the policemen allegedly fabricated evidence and gave false testimony. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army said security forces uncovered a ring of Moslem extremists connected with the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> organization and arrested several. It said three <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> members believed involved in the abduction and slayings of two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers were not caught. The body of one of the missing soldiers, 18-year-old <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>, was never found, but an army statement said that during interrogation, the detainees' yielded concrete evidence he was dead. <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON> was last seen May 3 hitchhiking. The suspects are also believed involved in the Feb. 16 kidnapping and slaying of 21-year-old soldier <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, who disappeared while hitchhiking home. His body was found May 7 in a grove near the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the body of 28-year-old <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Samhan </PERSON> was discovered. He had been stabbed, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said he was suspected of collaborating with Israeli officials. A 24-year-old Palestinian identified as <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> was attacked by masked Arabs in the village of <LOCATION> Safa </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the killing appeared to be the result of a dispute between Palestinian factions.

 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Tuesday to deploy a 625-member Central American peacekeeping force, whose main job will be to keep Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from infiltrating <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Another mission for the peacekeepers is to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are being made to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Because <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers are not sent to combat areas, approval of the border patrol operation is expected to increase pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to restore its cease-fire with the U.S.-backed rebels, which President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> ended last week. The unit will be the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force deployed in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, although a two-man observer group was stationed in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> during factional warfare in 1965-66. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said it was `` a complex and ground-breaking operation, which is being set in motion in a region characterized in recent years by its volatility.'' He said he would deploy the peacekeepers cautiously, in stages. The 15-member council gave the operation a six-month mandate that can be renewed. Before the vote, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> told the council: `` My government supports the establishment of an effective and comprehensive <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer force in Central America.'' Approval was delayed for several weeks by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reservations. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> questioned whether the force was large enough and was concerned about the cost, $ 41 million for the first six months. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will provide most of the soldiers, pilots, and staff for the operation, to be called <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Observer Group-Central <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have agreed in principle to provide troops to a <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> contingent of the force. On Thursday and Friday, delegations of the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government are to meet at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> attending as an observer. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> requested the talks when <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called off the cease-fire after 19 months, accusing the Contras of killing dozens of Nicaraguans in attacks aimed at undermining national elections set for Feb. 25. The Contras deny making attacks. A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said privately all issues would be on the table, including the voluntary disbanding of the Contras, security guarantees for rebels returning home and political reform in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Central American peacekeeping force will have jeeps, helicopters and speedboats. Its jobs are to prevent any nation from attacking a neighbor, verify that no rebel raiders cross borders and halt any broadcasts by insurgents. It will will have 260 military observers, 115 crew members for helicopters and an airplane, 50 members of a naval unit operating speedboats and patrol boats, 14 medical personnel, about 104 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administrators and 82 civilians recruited locally. Headquarters will be in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The force will have liaison offices in the other Central American capitals and 31 `` verification centers'' manned by mobile observers.

 Industrial nations, which produce two-thirds of the gas emissions associated with global warming, were still divided at the end of a conference Tuesday on how to reduce them. At the two-day conference of 68 nations on ways to slow or halt dangerous climatic changes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> refused to commit themselves to stabilizing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000. Environmentalists said the reservations to the final declaration were a setback to efforts against the `` greenhouse effect,'' the gradual warming of Earth's atmosphere. `` Less than six months ago in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked of the urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Now, the White House has sabotaged the first international effort to make good on the president's words,'' said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental group. The meeting's final declaration said: `` In the view of many industrialized nations, such stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions should be achieved as a first step at the latest by the year 2000.'' It said a `` stable development of the world economy'' remained essential and urged industrial nations to study `` the feasibility of achieving targets to ... reduce carbon dioxide emission levels by the year 2005.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, chief administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is not one of the countries that has agreed to go so far. ... While stabilization is necessary, we must closely analyze the means to achieve that.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the proposed measures could only be implemented at great cost. It is estimated that hundreds of billions of dollars would be needed to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and industrial plants around the world. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to a compromise declaration saying the pollutants should be stabilized `` as soon as possible.'' Administration sources said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators felt they could accept that wording because it did not tie any nation to specific levels of pollution reduction or require levels to be stabilized by a specific year. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking privately, said the revised declaration noted only that, `` in the view of many industrialized nations'' but not necessarily all, carbon dioxide emissions should be stabilized by 2000. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, deputy presidential press secretary, said: `` We're not willing to agree to a set time We did not sign on to anything mentioning the year 2000.'' Several developing nations, including <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, voiced reservations at the conference. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the Scandinavian countries had teamed with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful effort to get unanimous approval of such a commitment. The Dutch sponsors of the conference and others also pushed to set a level at which the emissions of ozone-threatening gases would be frozen by the end of the century. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON>, the West German environment minister, took a less bleak view. `` <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and the others will take the message home that more is expected of them,'' <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON> told reporters. `` That means we'll have a better starting point for the next conferences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N.-sponsored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> is to meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in February and the second World Climate Conference is to be held in late 1990. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` enthusiastically supporting,'' those meetings and did not want to `` excessively influence'' them by committing itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at the <LOCATION> Noordwijk </LOCATION> conference. Those emissions, along with those of chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides, are believed to be the major cause of the rise in atmospheric temperatures. About 65 percent of the emissions originate from industrialized nations in the northern hemisphere, according to a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Dutch <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produces 23.7-percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turn subtropical zones into deserts and coastal nations could face massive inundations.

<TEXT>
 Women are running for the first time in parliamentary elections Wednesday, which are the first in 22 years and will formalize the Arab kingdom's separation from the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The three-week campaign was among the freest in the Arab world, conducted by nearly 650 candidates embracing Islamic fundamentalists, tribal sheiks, Communists, businessmen, former intelligence agents and former political prisoners. Only a few rallies were held Tuesday, but thousands of banners still fluttered and newspapers were crammed with appeals to the 877,000 voters. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dustour </ORGANIZATION> alone carried 222 political ads in its 30 pages. A <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday night that 649 candidates were registered. Jordanian television put the figure at 648. The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, whose platform includes a more Islamic government and destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, attracted the largest crowds to rallies for its 26 Parliament candidates. Political analysts said it might win 12 to 20 of the 80 seats, but predictions were being made in a void because of the long period without elections, a lack of opinion polls and numerous candidates in each race. Despite martial law and a 33-year-old ban on political parties, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s government allowed political groups to run slates openly for the first time since 1956. They held rallies and debates that attracted thousands of <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION>. `` I think this is the most important election <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has ever experienced,'' said former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, who resigned as deputy prime minister to run for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, the capital. The unusually free election follows two major events: <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s worst economic crisis in decades, which led to riots in April, and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s rununciation of claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in July 1988 in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is leaving the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> out of national elections for the first time since 1950, and that will help formalize the division. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in the June war of 1967, two months after the last election. Loss of the territory, which held half the 60 seats in the old parliament, made national elections impossible. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> suspended the legislature in 1974, then revived it a decade later. Because women were given the right to vote only in 1974, this is the first general election in which they can participate. Twelve are running for Parliament. The last parliament was largely passive in recent years, but earlier legislatures have been so independent that kings often have suspended them. Parliament must approve all laws, has the power to override a royal veto and can dismiss cabinets. With no organized governing party, the government must forge alliances to get its proposals through. `` It will be a more important parliament than before,'' said <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, the former foreign minister. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a political scientist, noted that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had changed dramatically since the last election. Only one Jordanian in 20 went beyond high school in 1967, but the rate today is greater than one in three, he said.

Members of the General Synod passed by a simple majority the first clause of a proposed amendment to canon law to permit ordination of women. It reads: `` It shall be lawful for the General Synod to make provision by canon for enabling a woman to be ordained to the office of priest if she otherwise satisfies the requirements of <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> as to the persons who may be ordained as priests. `` Nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be consecrated to the office of bishop.'' The change came on the first day of a two-day debate and was supported by all three branches of the synod, the church's parliament The bishops voted 30-17 in favor, the clergy 149-85 in favor and the lay members 144-78 in favor. `` It went better than we thought,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> <PERSON> Deas </PERSON>, executive secretary of the Movement for the Ordination of Women. `` We are very pleased.'' The issue now goes to the 43 dioceses for discussion by ordinary members of the church. This is expected to start next year. The question will probably not return to the General Synod for a final vote until 1992, when a two-thirds majority will be required. The General Synod threw out two controversial amendments _ one to create a separate church allowing only male priests; the other to allow a parish within a diocese that ordained women to transfer to a diocese which did not. About 1,200 women have been ordained in Anglican churches, mainly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. It has been a major point of contention between Anglicans and Roman Catholics in their ecumenical encounters. The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has debated the issue for two decades. Some opponents among the clergy and laity say they will break away if women are ordained. At the start of debate, Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of women to proceed in the dioceses, despite remaining undecided on the basic principle of women priests. `` I judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring forward,'' he said. Explaining his dilemma, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said on one hand he believed theological arguments could justify ordaining women. On the other, he said, women priests would have a detrimental effect on church unity, as both he and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said during his visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in September. `` I can not deny the serious obstacle which this move has created there,'' he said. The bishop of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, the Right Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, drew loud applause when he said, `` Ordination of women to the priesthood is not the end of the world. If the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s making a mistake were the end of the world, the world would have ended long ago.'' The bishop of <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON>, said he would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally passed, despite being a supporter of women priests. He said he did not want to have to choose between favoring opponents or supporters among his congregations. <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, one of 500 women deacons anxious to become priests, told the Synod: `` The vast majority are not a regiment of strident feminists but are dedicated women who quietly and efficiently get on with the job within the confines of the present strictures.''

 A member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel extradited last month from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison and fined $ 25,000 for his 5-year-old drug conviction. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, 44, fled to his homeland after his 1983 indictment, forfeiting a $ 200,000 bond. He was convicted in absentia in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1984 of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 660 pounds of cocaine. Defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said he was n't surprised <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> received the maximum federal penalty, but contended his client's rights were ignored `` Pawns like <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> are being given to the public because of the hysteria over drugs,'' <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said. At Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> asked that <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> be returned to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because of improper extradition procedures, and that the time he has served in prison since his 1983 indictment be credited to his sentence. `` The defense motion for credit for time served is premature,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said, adding that such a motion must go to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and not to the sentencing court. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> could n't be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the charges against him predated an extradition agreement between the two countries <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> had been incarcerated for 22 months in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> pending that ruling. But <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> was extradited under presidential orders, independent of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> courts, <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> revived extraditions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of the emergency measures against drug traffickers imposed Aug. 18, after the assassination of a presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of the drug trade. Six people have since been extradited; <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> is the only one tried and convicted, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he will rule Nov. 22 on the extradition question. The government portrayed <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> as a major money launderer for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Testimony in the 1984 trial revealed <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> was responsible for shipments of cocaine valued at $ 6 million in 1981 and 1982. But <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> maintained his client was merely a courier. `` He did something wrong and admitted to it,'' <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said. `` But if I might use the term, he was a flunky.'' <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said he will appeal the conviction and <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>'s extradition

<HEAD>Government Decrees State of Emergency in Four More Provinces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Tuesday imposed a curfew in two departments and placed four <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> provinces under state-of-emergency rule to combat the campaign by leftist guerrillas to disrupt Sunday's elections. The state of emergency decree published Tuesday also extends for 30 days emergency rule in five other provinces in the department of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. All 11 provinces in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> department are now under emergency decrees, which suspend civil rights and give police powers to the military to maintain order. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and the port of <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION>, each a separate province, were placed under a a 30-day state of emergency on Oct. 24. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, a department is the largest political subdivision _ similar to a state _ and is made up of provinces. More than 330 people have been killed in October in attacks related to efforts by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement to disrupt the municipal elections. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspapers are calling the month `` Red October.'' In <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> rebels entered a radio studio Tuesday and forced an announcer to read a statement warning people not to vote, police said. Night curfews were ordered in <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> departments. They are mining and agricultural regions in the Andes east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Guerrillas exploded bombs early Tuesday at two banks, a mining company office and a police barracks in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oroya </LOCATION>, 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, officials reported. They said four policemen were wounded in the attack on the barracks. About one-third of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and more than half of the nation's 21 million people are now under emergency rule. The government has used state of emergency decrees in an effort to combat terrorism since 1982. Among the provisions of the decrees are the suspension of habeas corpus and free movement and assembly rights and guarantees against search and seizure. More than 15,000 people have been killed in guerrilla-related violence since the Shining Path began its terrorist campaign in 1980, according to the government.

 Financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> dismissed many of its 1,800 remaining employees and stranded some passengers Tuesday, after the airline abruptly canceled its last 46 round-trip flights. A severe cash shortage short-circuited the company's reorganization plan and forced it to halt passenger service as of midnight Monday, said Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> after an emergency meeting of the board of directors <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which sought protection from creditors Sept. 28 while it developed a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws, is looking for a buyer, officials said. Many of its remaining employees were being dismissed Tuesday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` The situation is confusing, to say the least,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Most people, I assume, are losing their jobs right away ... I'm not getting a lot of information from our executives. <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said in his announcement that employees would be notified of their status individually. Before its filing, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> operated 256 round-trip flights and had employed as many as 4,800 people. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing, said discussions were under way with potential investors. The immediate objective is `` to attempt to continue reorganization under the Chapter 11 code as a viable charter entity,'' he said. `` There are no plans at this point to give consideration to liquidation.'' However, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he doubted a buyer would be found for the entire airline and that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> would probably be liquidated. `` I do n't think you're really buying much if you bought the whole thing,'' he said. `` Some assets would be of interest.'' The cancellations surprised and angered pilots and other employees and left a few customers frustrated in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other major airports. `` We're all in shock,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> pilot based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I did n't expect something like this to happen. We were hoping that someone would buy <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and want to run it, but maybe there was nothing left to buy.'' Passengers calling to check about flights were advised to try other airlines `` who may honor tickets in some cases.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> ticketing and check-in counters were unstaffed. Passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was taking <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> customers on a standby basis. United was giving <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> ticketholders a 50 percent discount on a full-fare coach ticket. There were no long lines of passengers, as there were in September when <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection. `` I think the word was out and people were booking elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>, assistant general manager at the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport. The carrier had been operating from week to week, relying on emergency infusions of cash approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. In its filing, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> listed debt of $ 347 million and assets of $ 326 million. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 nearly $ 1 billion in debt. It started flying again in 1984 as a low-cost, no-frills carrier. The company was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION>, an investor group formed by <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in June 1988, and shifted most of its flight operations to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. It moved its corporate headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> early this year and had ambitious expansion plans, but it kept getting deeper into debt.

ADN said the silver lamp was donated by a Jewish family in 1866 and had likely hanged in a prominent place in the synagogue. The synagogue was once one of the largest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The ruins have stood unattended since the end of World War II. Restoration efforts began in late 1988. When completed, the building is to become an international center for Jewish culture and tradition.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it wo n't show a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee a legal opinion broadening <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrest powers overseas because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is no more entitled to see it than the public <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the opinion stating that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have legal authority to seize fugitives overseas without permission of a foreign government is considered private legal advice for the bureau that wo n't be made public. The opinion's author, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, is scheduled to be questioned about it on Wednesday by members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. Asked why the opinion, which is not classified, was being withheld from members of the subcommittee, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> replied: `` Why would we treat the committee any differently than the news media or the general public?'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> will go up and talk about it and answer questions, but it's in keeping with department policy not to make the opinion public,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` It's our view that it's a confidential legal opinion.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is not privy to legal opinions produced for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> heads, issued the June 21 opinion in response to a request for advice from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, expressed incredulity over <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>'s statement his panel was not entitled to see the document `` Maybe that <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> needs more experience, it needs an education about how the government is supposed to work in a free society,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` And our hearing tomorrow, I hope, will guide them along that path.'' Besides approving the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by law is required to oversee its operations. `` That's what we take the oath of office to do,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> was summoned along with Associate Deputy <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> to answer questions about the opinion, which sparked veiled criticism last month from Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called it `` a very narrow legal opinion based on consideration only of domestic <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> laws.'' The secretary said `` it did not take into account international law, nor did it weigh the president's constituitnal responsibliity to carry out the foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The document entitled `` Authority of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to Override Customary or Other International Law in the Course of Extraterritorial Law Enforcement Activities'' reverses a 1980 legal opinion that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> could not arrest a fugitive without obtaining a foreign government's permission. The earlier opinion, written in response to a query over whether the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had authority to seize fugitive financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, was eventually published. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have stressed that the opinion is aimed intended to clarify the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s legal authority to seize fugitives from countries that do not cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or where there is no law and order, such as in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

The governor's race pitted two candidates with a history of overcoming long odds and featured a high-profile debate over access to abortion, which <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> supports and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> opposes. Early turnout was described as heavy in most parts of the state. `` We're on roller skates,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the registrar in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, describing the action in her office. `` It seems like a tremendous turnout.''

 The East German government resigned Tuesday, a victim of mass emigration and pro-democracy turmoil, and pleas came from within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for changes in its top ranks. More than 100,000 people marched for democracy in five East German cities. A <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee rejected a draft law allowing up to 30 days of travel abroad just a day after it was published, and said unrestricted travel should be permitted. The 44-member Cabinet, called the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, resigned jointly, said government spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>.

About 175,000, more than 1 percent of the population, have left the country this year by legal or illegal means. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> will remain in office until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elects a new one, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, but did not say when that would occur. The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was to meet Wednesday to consider further changes. West German political leaders in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> applauded Tuesday's resignations but said only democratic reforms will quell unrest in the communist nation Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, said, `` If I am correctly gauging the will of the people, they will not be content with a few personnel changes, they will continue demanding a genuinely new political course.'' <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON>, general secretary of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said free elections now must follow. `` This move clearly reflects the mounting pressure for real democracy and freedom,'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The government did not have popular support. They have recognized this by resigning.'' <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, deputy White House deputy press secretary, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` If it leads to a process of reform, it can be a positive development.'' Several Communist Party officials and three small parties allied with the Communists urged the resignation of the Politburo itself, which met on Tuesday. Leaders `` should resign without any delay'' to make way for a new Politburo and government to carry out reforms, said the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>, organ of the Communist youth organization. <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who replaced his mentor <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, as party leader last month, has said five elderly Politburo members closely associated with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> will be replaced by the end of the week. Two other Politburo members lost their jobs when <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over Oct. 18. The Politburo, which normally has 21 members, also discussed an `` action program'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has said would contain sweeping political and economic reforms. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Krusche </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, called for immediate `` secret and free elections'' for a new government. About 5,000 people marched in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Tuesday to demand free elections and challenge the Communist monopoly on power. Police did not interfere with the protesters, who shouted: `` All power to the people!'' ADN, the official news agency, said 50,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION>, on the Baltic coast; 35,000-40 ,000 in <LOCATION> Nordhausen </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION>; and 20,000 in <LOCATION> Meiningen </LOCATION> <PERSON> Guntram </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON> of New Forum, the largest opposition group, told the <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> crowd his organization seeks `` peaceful transformation to a democratic state.'' On Monday, 750,000 demonstrators marched, about 500,000 in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> alone. East German leaders have been promising democratic reforms and freer travel in hopes of halting unrest, but the draft law appeared to satisfy no one. In rejecting the law in its current form, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said, the committee declared: `` The proposal does not meet the expectations of citizens ... and will not achieve the political credibility of the state.'' The panel recommended eliminating the need for exit visas, separating travel regulations from emigration rules, clarifying the access to foreign currency for trips abroad, reconsidering the 30-day limit and changing grounds on which passports can be refused. It also recommended an emergency <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session to find ways of persuading citizens to remain at home. The latest tide of emigration began early Saturday when departure was permitted through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the only country to which East Germans can travel freely. Opening <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> created the first free passage to the West since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in August 1961. Authorities have said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators Tuesday not to undermine a compromise to increase the minimum wage by seeking to amend the deal. A final vote on the plan was delayed until Wednesday morning by congressional action to increase the government's debt ceiling. Because of the delay, it was unclear whether several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators said to be mulling amendments would honor the administration's request, delivered in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the administration had supported the compromise passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week and `` accordingly I ask for your support of this same bill now before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with no amendments attached.'' It appeared, however, that at least one amendment would be offered, a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, to exempt small businesses from the increase in the minimum wage. The amendment, if offered, was expected to fail. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s letter was addressed to her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. A copy was given to Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Talks on raising the debt limit dragged on throughout the day, and Tuesday evening <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> announced the minimum-wage vote would be Wednesday. The legislation, as it now stands, would increase the hourly minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 3.80 next April 1 and to $ 4.25 a year later. It also would create a new, subminimum `` training wage'' for workers 16-19 years old new to the job market. All workers in that age group could be paid the subminimum for their first three months, and for another three months if enrolled in approved training programs. The subminimum would be $ 3.35 when the minimum wage rose to $ 3.80. It would rise to $ 3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $ 4.25. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

 Six wounded guerrillas and 25 of their relatives occupied a Roman Catholic church Tuesday to demand they and the others be allowed to leave the country for treatment. `` We are going to stay here as long as necessary to be able to leave,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Elida </PERSON>, a 19-year-old former rebel for the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Suffering from a leg wound, she said she has been with the guerrilla forces for nine years. Ms. <PERSON> Elida </PERSON> said she had received primitive medical attention in a rebel camp but still has difficulty walking and has not been able to return to combat. The group took over <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chruch </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to demand that President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> allow 109 of the war casualties be allowed to go abroad for specialized medical care. An injured 18-year-old rebel, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, said the occupation is indefinite. `` We will not move from here until we obtain evacuation,'' he said. The group's evacuation had been scheduled for last May by the government of then-President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. It was suspended in the face of strong opposition from the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1. A group of 47 wounded rebels were allowed to leave for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in September after occupying the Metropolitan Cathedral for 43 days and then taking refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Evacuations of Salvadoran war wounded began in 1984 under the <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> administration through negotiated exchanges of army officers held by the guerrillas for the wounded. In 1987, agreements were reached on evacuating the wounded without negotiations and exchanges. Since 1984, 393 former combatants have been given safe conduct out of the country to receive medical attention and rehabilitation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> decided Tuesday that `` Chicken Soup'' was n't good for the network, and canceled the new series Its star, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, said he was n't disappointed and felt `` somewhat relieved'' he can be himself again. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said in a statement that there have been many ups and downs in his life, `` but one thing that I know is that there are at least 20 million gentiles who now know what a real Jew sounds like.'' Tuesday's show was the series finale. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a rabbi-turned-comedian whose distinctive, staccato accent is part of his act, played a Jewish ex-pajama salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic widow portrayed by <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>. Although TV critics gave the series mixed reviews when it premiered on Sept. 12, many said it could n't miss because it followed <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s hit `` Roseanne'' on Tuesdays. Rival network executives who disagreed were proved right. `` Chicken Soup'' achieved respectable ratings, averaging an 18.6 rating and a 29 per cent share of the audience in its time period, according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. But <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> felt it was n't holding the audience that had been watching <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s preceding comedy, said a network executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the ratings for the week ending last Sunday, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s show was 23rd in prime-time ratings, well below `` Roseanne,'' which was in fourth place. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s series was a `` well-executed program'' that nonetheless did n't achieve <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s hopes that it would help maintain the network's ratings strengths on Tuesday, its key night, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iger </PERSON> said in a statement The series had three more finished episodes awaiting broadcast when it was canceled. No decision has been made yet on what will be done with them, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Chicken Soup'' was the third new series axed this season <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nutt House'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The People Next Door'' were the earlier casualties. `` Chicken Soup'' will be suceeded, starting Nov. 21, by `` Coach,'' which premiered last season and stars <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as a college football coach. The announced end of `` Chicken Soup'' came on the same day as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral election, in which Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> faced <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> earlier touched off a controversy while campaigning for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> quit the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign in September over remarks he made about <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who is black. Among other things, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said Jews would vote for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> out of guilt. The comedian apologized for his remarks, which were reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, and said he had learned that `` what's funny on stage can be insensitive when it's said off the stage and in the world of politics. And for my insensitivity, I apologize.'' In his statement Tuesday, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> praised the staff of `` Chicken Soup,'' and said he would continue to perform club dates, possibly put on another one-man show on Broadway and work on other projects.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night hailed the election of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s new president under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peace plan, a not-so-thinly veiled rebuke to Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who rejects the development. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Christian army commander, spurned the entire peace plan adopted by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on the ground it did not include a timetable for withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian soldiers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> responded by adopting a unanimous statement urging `` all sectors of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people, including the armed forces, to come to the support of their president.'' The council members `` welcome the election of the president of the Lebanese republic and the Taif agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.'' The legislators adopted the changes at an emergency meeting held in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Parliament met at <LOCATION> Kleiat </LOCATION> in Syrian-controlled northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday and elected <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, as president. It endorsed political changes worked out by legislators at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation, which give Moslems more power in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil war. The legislators met in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> threatened to shell the Parliament building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said they `` pay particular tribute to the high sense of responsibility and to the courage of the Lebanese members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Syrians are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls it an occupation army. A six-month artillery war between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s men and the Syrians killed hundreds of people and wounded thousands before it was suspended by a truce in September. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> have led competing Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> ended without <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> agreeing on a successor. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war has killed more than 150,000 people since 1975.

<HEAD>Congressional Negotiators Agree on Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, acting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assent, agreed Tuesday on a stiffer set of trade sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in response to last summer's Tiananmen Square massacre. The sanctions were included in a compromise version of a two-year, $ 9.7 billion bill authorizing activities of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related federal agencies. The measure now goes back to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for final approval. The measure contained harsh rhetoric condemning the `` unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 4, noting that at least 700 people died and another 27 or more were executed afterward. The bill also condemned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to conceal the truth of what happened, including clandestinely disposing of bodies and suppressing news reports. But its strongest section was a set of trade sanctions, including suspension of insurance trough the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for companies doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; suspension of trade assistance; a freeze on exports of satellites; a halt to sales of controlled munitions, including helicopters and parts, and crime control equipment; and an end to sale of certain nuclear material and components. The sanctions go beyond penalties imposed earlier in the year by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the measure was initially opposed by the White House. But it was later accepted after Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, agreed to make it easier for the president to waive the sanctions. In discussions with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said, the measure was altered to allow termination of the sanctions if the president certifies such action is `` in the national interest.'' Scowcroft reported that the president would not veto the measure based on that provision, said <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>. As the conferees worked through a list of disagreements between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills, they also accepted a section that would impose criminal penalties on any government official who enlists any foreign government to carry out policies that are banned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The amendment was intended to bar use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid as leverage on recipient countries to support goals that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not pursue directly because of legal restrictions. It is aimed at situations like the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to pressure that government to support the Contra rebels fighting the leftist governnment in neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That provision, which stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' discoveries during the Iran-Contra affair, could still provide a reason for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the bill. The overall measure included $ 4.7 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and $ 5 billion for next year. It includes major boosts in aid for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. They would be authorized to receive a total of $ 832 million this year and $ 939 million next year, compared with $ 520 million last year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes democratic elections abroad, could get up to $ 25 million in each of the two years, compared with $ 15 million last year.

 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has served eight terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and wrote the nation's Superfund cleanup law. But he has always made it clear that he would happily trade the nation's Capitol for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> On his third try Tuesday, he made it. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, a 52-year-old Democrat, was elected governor, easily defeating Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>. The victory came eight years after <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> lost the closest gubernatorial election in the state's history. For <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, mastering subjects such as the environment and transportation played well to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> residents, who live in a pollution-riddled and traffic-clogged state. `` I did n't pick these topics because I wanted to be governor,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said. `` I've been involved in environmental legislation for 20 years. I was a bird-watcher when I was a kid.'' The son of an Italian immigrant shipyard painter, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and left high school at age 17 to join the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. He earned his high school equivalency diploma, and later degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. After three terms in the state Assembly, he was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Democrats' 1974 `` Watergate'' freshman class. His district takes in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, an aging industrial city just across the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> gained statewide recognition when he ran fourth in his party's 1977 gubernatorial primary. He won the Democratic nomination in 1981, but lost the general election to Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.4 million cast. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> went on to become one of the most popular modern governors, but was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term. In 1981, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> was criticized as being an icy candidate who could n't relate to people. He set out to change that this year, and jokingly referred to himself as `` warm and wonderful.'' He became <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> the people-meeter. Friends say a big part of the transformation is attributed to a happier personal life. But others say the `` new <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'' persona has been carefully crafted by an experienced campaign staff. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> ran as a loner in 1981 while separated from his first wife. This time, he campaigned with his new wife, <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON>, a school teacher. He drew approving cheers throughout the campaign by mentioning his two new grandchildren.

<HEAD>President Aquino Defends Her Government's Human Rights Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on Tuesday defended her government's record on human rights, saying she was personally committed because she had been a victim of abuses. Speaking with reporters following a meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, she said, `` I would like to tell you that having been a victim of human rights abuses myself, I am certainly committed. In fact I have stated throughout my administration that we will not tolerate any violations of human rights.'' Her husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was shot to death in 1983 at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport when he returned from self-exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to campaign against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> became president after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in a military-civilian uprising in February 1986. Several human rights groups claim Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has failed to control army and paramilitary groups that the groups say violate rights in the fight against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is on a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and then will go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for four days. She said she hears few complaints about human rights abuses until she travels abroad. `` We have a very free press in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and I want to tell the Canadians that very rarely does this -LRB- allegations of rights violations -RRB- appear in our press,'' she said. `` I am really surprised that it is only in foreign countries that there is so much talk about alleged human rights abuses.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, also speaking with reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, said he has done much to improve human rights.

 Voters decided <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most contentious mayoral election in more than a decade Tuesday, choosing between a Democrat who would be the first black to win City Hall and a Republican running as a reformer. Three network-owned television stations projected Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> as the winner over <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> called the contest based on surveys of voters leaving polling places as soon as they closed at 9 p.m. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, maintained the multiracial support that enabled him to defeat three-term incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in the Democratic primary, according to pre-election polls. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, hamstrung by the vast Democratic majority in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, accepted the tiny <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination in a bid to fashion a reform-minded `` fusion'' candidacy that crossed party lines. In late morning, under a clear sky and bright sunshine, <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorno </PERSON> said he expected the predicted turnout of 60 percent to 65 percent to hold up.

 <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, 45, a former federal prosecutor making his first run for elective office, sharply criticized <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> throughout the 56-day campaign, calling him a clubhouse politician with questionable ethical standards. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> criticized his opponent's change of views on abortion _ <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> first opposed it, then reversed himself _ and his qualifications for office. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> also drew the contest as a battle between Democrats and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which he blamed for deep federal budget cuts in urban programs. Many prominent Democrats campaigned and advertised for him. Mainly, though, the 62-year-old <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> stressed his theme of social healing, repeatedly referring to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s ethnic and racial groups as `` a gorgeous mosaic'' stitched together by common interests. Both candidates asked that they be judged on their abilities, not their race. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was propelled by his solid defeat of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the ebullient but often-abrasive mayor since 1977. The city's Democratic organizations and most unions lined up with <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, providing him endorsements, donations and thousands of volunteers. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> worked and advertised for his conqueror. The general election was the most hotly contested since <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, running as a Liberal, in 1977. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s most daunting hurdle was the Democrats' monster edge in voter registration: Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-1 margin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 2.2 million to 450,000. There are an additional 460,000 independents. To overcome that disadvantage <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> tried to remake the cross-party `` fusion'' candidacies fashioned by the three Republicans elected mayor this century _ <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON> in 1901, <LOCATION> Fiorello </LOCATION> <LOCATION> H. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> in 1933, 1937 and 1941, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> in 1965. In appealing for Democratic defectors, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> stressed his record as a corruption-fighting prosecutor and hammered at <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' sloppy financial record-keeping, including his failure to file income taxes from 1969-72 <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the tax lapse was an oversight and a thing of the past. But there were damaging reports of more recent flaws: conflicting valuations <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> assigned to stock that he transferred to his son in 1986; failure to disclose a friend's partial funding of a vacation he took to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; two votes by aides, acting in his place, that contravened an Ethics Board recommendation. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> also underwent repeated questioning about his relationship with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose 1988 presidential campaign he headed in the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is anathema to some Jewish voters because of his support for Palestinian rights and his 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expects a broad agreement on renewing the lease for military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> makes her second official visit to this country this week, a senior administration official said. `` This is going to be an important and, we think, a very successful visit,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official also told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is confident `` that, at the end of the day, there will be an agreement'' on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> beyond expiration in 1991 of the current arrangement. The issue is expected to come up during Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s scheduled meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House Thursday, and the two countries have agreed to start formal negotiations next month on extending their bases agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> arrives from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday evening on the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state visit of her presidency. White House talks and a state dinner hosted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries and leaders of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and visits to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> and the National Museum of Natural History are on her two-day schedule in the capital. Predicting `` long and very complicated'' negotiations over the future of <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station and four smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, the official said, `` we think there's a logic that both parties will see ... that these facilities do, in fact, serve the interests of both countries in very important ways.'' `` I think that will be the compelling fact that will assert itself, and I think we will have an agreement. We're going into it with that frame of mind,'' he said. Despite the drop in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> tension, the bases remain important to <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and regional security and `` are regarded by every government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as a stabilizing factor,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` They are a known quantity and an important representation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> commitment to the security and stability of the region ... and I think that's a sentiment still widely shared throughout the region.'' The main purpose of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s visit is to stimulate interest in trade and investment, along with a continued flow of development aid, the official noted. He said <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials are in the final stages of reaching agreement with creditors on a buyback of up to $ 1.4 billion worth of the country's foreign debt. `` We hope it succeeds. We will help it succeed if we can,'' he said.

 A wave of mud and rocks cascaded down a hillside and across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> on Tuesday, sweeping three cars across the scenic route and closing it for at least 24 hours, authorities said.

 A moderate aftershock from the killer earthquake three weeks ago rattled the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and nearby areas on Tuesday, injuring at least one person but causing no property damage, officials said. A woman fell down at a shopping center and broke an arm, said police in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, which is nearly 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The quake measured 4.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, making it the 23rd aftershock of magnitude 4.0 or higher since the Oct. 17 quake that caused 66 deaths and an estimated $ 17 billion in property damage. That quake, which registered 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was centered in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The center of Tuesday's aftershock was 12 miles southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and 17 miles north <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, and was felt as far north as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` It was a pretty good shake,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gatos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was scary,'' said <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public information officer. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.

 A judge who sat on the bench for 17 years abused his power to get cut-rate bank loans, demanded bribes from an attorney and staff and forced court employees to do personal chores, prosecutors said Tuesday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON>, 59, stands accused of a decade of violations as judge, including extortion, bribery, open lewdness and coercion. He has denied the charges. He also faces a second trial on 16 counts related to more private charges. `` We do n't mean to say Judge <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> was a corrupt judge in every case,'' said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> in his opening statement. But <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> `` definitely abused the very powers, the privileges and the responsibilities which were conferred upon him by you.'' The suspended judge frequently wrote on a yellow legal pad as the prosecutor described 13 incidents cited in 11 counts of public corruption. His wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, sat at his side and also took notes. <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON>'s trial has been the talk of this community in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. At times, it has verged on soap opera, with allegations that the judge ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in his underpants or naked, and that he ordered court workers to chop his wood and feed his dogs. About 20 observers, including reporters, were scattered throughout the large, ornate courtroom where <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> took his oath as president judge 1 -LCB- years ago. Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelovich </PERSON> later told visiting Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grifo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> he would wait to present his opening statement until the prosecution had rested its case. During his 45-minute opening argument, <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> told the jury numerous documents will be presented during the trial to prove <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON>'s guilt. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> used his influence to secure lower interest on a $ 10,000 bank loan in 1986. The prosecutor said the judge also had a staff member pay him $ 500 in exchange for a better job with the county and ordered him and another court employee to perform personal tasks for him on county time. Last March, a state grand jury recommended <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> be charged with 13 years' worth of violations, including extortion, bribery, lewdness and coercion. He was elected to his first 10-year term as a judge in 1971 and re-elected in 1981. Although the grand jury recommended 76 charges, most of those were dismissed, withdrawn or combined with other charges. Twenty-seven remain, 11 of which involve public corruption and 16 of which involve more private charges. The first witness, auto dealer <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, said <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> bought a Pontiac Sunbird from his family's dealership in 1984. He testified that on one contract, the judge signed his full name then crossed it out and instead wrote `` Judge <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON>.'' `` He said ` My name is judge,''' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. An $ 8,000 loan was financed through <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ebensburg </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> and former car loan officer, said he was told <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> was paying $ 1,298 as a down payment on the Sunbird. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said he did n't know until the trial that <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON>'s check totaled only $ 298. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said it's difficult to say whether he would have approved the loan if he had known <PERSON> O'Kicki </PERSON> was putting down only $ 298 in cash.

 Nearly half the 1,100 federal troops sent to maintain order on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> after Hurricane Hugo have returned home following a presidential order to withdraw. About 250 troops returned home aboard C-141 transport planes Tuesday. On Sunday, the first 250 were flown back to the States, said <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` We should all be home for Thanksgiving,'' he said. The C-141 and C-130 transport planes were constantly flying in and out of the island to evacuate heavy equipment and vehicles brought by the soldiers when they arrived on Sept. 21, four days after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s ravaged the island. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the withdrawal last week following a request by Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>, who said the troops, most of them from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were no longer needed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were sent to curb looting and help local authorities maintain order. Most stores had already been sacked of food and other commodities by the time the soldiers arrived. `` It's important for the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the police to get back on their own feet now,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>'s request for the pullout was criticized by three business organizations, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> and a civic group called the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION>. They charged the governor reneged on his promise to keep the federal troops until all power and telephone services were restored. Hugo caused more than $ 500 million in damage to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, mostly on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, where most of the 52,000 residents were left homeless.

 A jury on Tuesday acquitted former child television star <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter charges in the shooting of a man at a `` crack'' house. However, the jurors told <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Florence-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> they were deadlocked on an assault charge, and resumed deliberations. The 24-year-old former `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' star was accused of shooting eight bullets into the head of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Tex'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, 25, and slashing his throat during a Feb. 2 scuffle in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> house where crack cocaine was being Clay survived the attack. Bridges had tearfully told jurors he was a suicidal cocaine addict at the time. He showed no emotion Tuesday as the verdict was read. In announcing the deadlocke on the assault charge, jurors said it was possible they could reach a verdict with more instruction from the judge, said <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. The judge told them to go back into the jury room and write down questions they need instruction on so they could continue deliberating, she said. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> testified that Bridges was `` based out'' from freebasing or smoking cocaine when the shooting occurred. `` He looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his head,'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> described himself as a bodyguard for the owner of the house where Bridges was living. He told of arguments that involved Bridges purportedly taking weapons from the house and selling them. Defense attorney <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> maintained that Bridges shot <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> in self-defense. Bridges testified that <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> borrowed his BMW automobile, and never returned it. The actor said <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> hit him, pushed him over a fence and locked him out of the house. Bridges, who for eight years played actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> on the `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' series, testified he became depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was canceled in That same year he discovered his accountant had embezzled more than $ 1 million from his account, Bridges testified. `` It came to the point where I became very mentally unstable. ... The only thing I had left was to kill myself,'' the actor said. Bridges said that at the time of the shooting he was consuming 14 grams of cocaine a day.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the satanic `` Night Stalker'' who butchered or raped more than a dozen people in a spree that terrorized <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1985, was sentenced Tuesday to death in the gas chamber. Before he was sentenced, the 29-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> killer, wearing dark glasses, uttered a rambling, nearly inaudible statement in court that ended with the words: `` Lucifer dwells within us all.'' `` You do n't understand me. You are not expected to. You are not capable of it,'' he said. `` I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil. Legions of the night, night breed. Repeat not the errors of ` Night Prowler' and show no mercy. I will be avenged.'' The sentence, pronounced by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, carries an automatic appeal. The killer, who entered unlocked houses late at night to murder people in their beds and beat others and demand money, was convicted Sept. 20 of 13 murders and 30 other felonies, including rape, burglary and sodomy. He often left satanic symbols scrawled at the scenes of his crimes and in at least one instance, gouged out the eyes of a victim. During his preliminary hearing, he appeared in court one day with a pentagram drawn on the palm of his hand and flashed it to reporters as he said: `` Hail, Satan!'' The jury recommended Oct. 4 that he be sentenced to death. Jurors, some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to intimidate them during the trial by sneering and glaring at them, returned death penalty recommendations on each of 19 special circumstance counts. `` The jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this court has ratified that judgment,'' <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> said. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, dismissed <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' statement as `` more baloney.'' `` I certainly would n't want anyone to listen to what he has to say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some structure in his life,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said. One of the defense attorneys, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, said appeals courts would face a novel issue in the case, that of determining the impact on the trial of the slaying of a juror during deliberations. A juror was shot to death in August by her boyfriend, who later took his own life. A snarling, gravely voiced <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> had earlier sneered at the possibility of being sentenced to death. `` Big deal, death comes with the territory,'' he told reporters after last month's sentencing recommendation. `` See you in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>.'' After his September conviction, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> flashed a two-fingered `` devil sign'' at photographers and muttered one word: `` Evil.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday night to raise the treasury's borrowing authority above $ 3.1 trillion, preventing the government from reneging for the first time ever on its pledge to repay creditors. The legislation was approved by voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and by a 269-99 margin in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. His signature would prevent the government from running out of cash on Thursday. `` Default is unthinkable,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` It would strike a devastating blow to our country's credit rating.'' The way for action on the debt-ceiling increase was cleared earlier in the evening when leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> worked out an arrangement that removed from the debt-ceiling debate a fight over modifying catastrophic health insurance for retirees. The agreement was blocked for more than an hour by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. He sought to add to the debt-ceiling bill an amendment that would bar use of the cash-laden Social Security trust fund income to make the budget deficit look smaller than it is. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> dropped his objection after Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, assured him that the Social Security amendment would be given priority consideration next year. Under the agreement: _ The debt-ceiling bill has only one amendment That would repeal a 1986 law, bitterly opposed by business, that prohibits employer-financed health insurance plans from discriminating against lower-paid workers. House acceptance of that amendment would send the package to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would pass a new bill repealing catastrophic medical coverage for retirees That would send the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which would be expected to amend it with a plan repealing the unpopular surtax that finances catastrophic insurance while retaining coverage for hospital bills. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would work out a compromise somewhere between total repeal and keeping hospital benefits. Without an increased debt ceiling, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would order banks, starting Thursday, not to honor any checks issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. Owners of maturing federal securities would have to continue holding those bonds, creating a cloud over the government's credit rating and raising interests rates, economists say. `` It is important to our economy and our country that we not risk the adverse consequences of default by the government,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in pleading with colleagues for a quick settlement of the problem. With no more authority to borrow, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suspended sales of savings bonds and special state and local securities and postponed auctions of $ 40 billion of securities. There was only token <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opposition to approving a House-passed bill raising the debt limit by $ 250 billion, since that would simply give the government authority to borrow to pay for goods and services it already has bought. But the measure became entangled with a host of other major issues, blocking quick resolution of any. These included the government's chief deficit-reduction bill of the year; a bipartisan compromise increasing the mininum wage; the fate of a year-old law expanding Medicare to protect retirees against cost of a catastrophic illness; a major child-care initiative and even a last-gasp effort by Republicans to pass President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed reduction in capital-gains taxes. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prodded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a deficit-reduction bill that will pass his muster. Otherwise, he told a news conference, he is prepared to make permanent the $ 16 billion in automatic spending cuts that took effect Oct. 16. He said an acceptable bill would have to cut the deficit by about $ 14 billion, considerably more than he and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed on last spring. Too, he said, `` if it's all loaded up with special projects, I wo n't sign it.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told reporters: `` We'll give him, I think, what we agreed to give him'' in the spring

' <LOCATION> BOGOTA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A bullfighter, a Marxist councilman and 12 other people were killed in four attacks Tuesday across <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. There were no immediate indications that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug cartels were involved in the killings, the latest to convulse this country since the government ordered a crackdown on traffickers in mid-August. Authorities said they did not know who carried out an attack in which six people riding in a truck were killed by gunmen in an ambush. In a separate incident, a bomb killed six other people, police said. Late Tuesday, <PERSON> Oky </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON>, a bullfighter who raised bulls and was a private pilot, was shot to death in an upper-class <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> suburb while driving a Jeep, police said. He was riddled with bullets from a passing car, the authorities said. At about the same time in <LOCATION> Santador </LOCATION> de Quilichao, a town about 210 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, assailants broke into the <ORGANIZATION> house </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and shot him to death. <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was local head of the Marxist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Officials gave these accounts of the other attacks: A group of men attacked a coffee plantation near <LOCATION> Quinchia </LOCATION>, a town 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, early Tuesday and a bomb was thrown into the owner's house. Quinchia Mayor <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network that six people were killed and five, including ranch owner <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuluaga </PERSON>, were wounded. He said <PERSON> Zuluaga </PERSON>'s wife, the couple's two daughters, two nephews and a ranch worker were killed. <PERSON> Botero </PERSON> reported <PERSON> Zuluaga </PERSON> said guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had demanded money and when he refused the extortioners threatened to kill him and his family. Police said they have not determined the motive for the ambush on a rural road near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gaceno </LOCATION>, a town 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. They said all six people aboard a truck were killed by men who stopped the vehicle, opened fire and then escaped. It was not known if that attack might be related to a strike by 22,000 banana plantation workers in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> where both leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads are active. The strike spread to 11 other districts Tuesday. The strike affecting plantations along <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast could cause a shortage of bananas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Companies exporting bananas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have said they were losing $ 1 million a day because of the strike that began Nov. l. The strike originally started to protest the killings last month of two union leaders. Union members blamed right-wing death squads for the killings. Now the strikers are demanding higher pay, shorters hours and medical care. The average pay for a plantation worker is the equivalent of $ 79 per month for six-day work weeks of 10 hours a day. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, claimed the strikes were organized by leftist guerrillas and were a `` festival of terrorism.'' He said in an interview published Tuesday by the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> that the strikes were organized by the Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, two of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s six left-wing guerrilla groups. The strike is centered in <LOCATION> Apartado </LOCATION>, a town of 100,000 and the capital of the region. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, army commander of the region, told <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> he feared there would be violence because of the strike. He said he had tried to get the companies and workers to reach an agreement that `` has no winners and no losers.'' The worst attack in the zone blamed on rightist death squads occurred about a year ago, on Nov. 11, when men firing from cars killed 43 people in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, a town 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Apartado </LOCATION>.

 In a darkened government auditorium five judges are sifting through 603 artists' works to choose the next official Duck Stamp for hunting licenses. But there's more than prestige on the line, for the winner also is likely to become a millionaire. The painting for the new stamp will become the 57th Duck Stamp and bring instant recognition to the winner within the community of wildlife artists and conservationists _ not to mention substantial economic reward. Well over a million of the stamps with the artist's design will be sold for the 1990-91 waterfowl hunting season to be placed on hunting licenses. For the federal government the stamp is a source of revenue for buying and protecting wetlands.

 An AIDS victim was led to take Holy Communion for the first time in 15 years. A priest was encouraged to seek reconciliation between his homosexuality and his Christianity. These are examples of the impact of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oasis </ORGANIZATION>, an unusual, recently opened <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> ministry to gays, as recounted by its pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. However, opponents say it surrenders to human weaknesses that are forbidden by the Bible. `` The lifestyle is wrong,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, interim vicar at the Church of The Transfiguration in neighboring <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>. `` If you accept the Bible as the standard of faith, it's clearly wrong. The controversial new center opened in June at <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, a city of 40,000 people on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> across from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, who has a mailing list of more than 200 people connected with The Oasis, has spent the last few months on the road spreading his view that Christianity can and should find room for homosexuals. `` If we're made in the image of God, then anything in human nature has its corollary in God,'' he said He said he and other homosexuals possess a special understanding of spirituality because so many people silently linger `` on the edge _ between masculinity and femininity, between respectability and criminality.'' His travels have led him to offer Communion to an AIDS-afflicted gay man who had left the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> 15 years ago. The man adorned his hospital room with flowers and _ along with his lover _ dressed in his Sunday best for the occasion, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The ministry's notoriety has reached as far as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest there wrote to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> seeking guidance on how to reconcile his devotion to the church with his homosexuality. `` He wanted to know how he could fit in within an anti-gay atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he has sought to show the priest and other homosexuals who have `` been taught they're going to hell'' that they have something to offer by acknowledging their differences and returning to religion. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` came out of the closet'' at age 23 after a fundamentalist upbringing in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He later lived with his current lover in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb along with his lover's former wife and two daughters before accepting the post in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>. He said he told church officials who read his application that `` You know you're not getting <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>, but you're not getting <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> either.'' However, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said his openness remains rare among homosexuals. `` Gay people typically lie _ they make up the name of a boyfriend or girlfriend. A lifetime of doing that erodes your self-esteem and takes its psychological toll.'' One homosexual parishioner, who insisted on anonymity, said he began attending because he wanted to answer his own spiritual questions and feel a part of something. He said he grew up as a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> but could not work with that church's gay outreach group, Dignity, because of what he felt was the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-gay bias. `` I see a very strong purpose to something like the Oasis,'' the man said. `` Most people feel quite alienated from organized religion. I've met a lot of nice people. But it has n't been The Dating Game experience.'' <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a 35-year-old heterosexual parishioner from <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION> with two children, said she and other parishioners respect <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' sexuality as part of who he is. `` There are people who I thought might get up and walk and have n't,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. Ministers within the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>, encompassing seven counties in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, differ over the Oasis. `` The call of the church is to be inclusive to all people,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>. `` I'm sure if more parish clergy looked at their congregation, they'd find gay people within their midst.'' A critic of the new ministry, the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantinos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, said the church should help homosexuals to `` become well'' instead of encouraging their lifestyles. The ministry does n't seem to be developing spin-offs. The Rev. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the adjacent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> diocese based in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, said none of its parishes plan to offer gay ministries. Rev. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>, a minister for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION> and a backer of the Oasis, said he hopes the ministry outgrows its need. `` I would hope that the Oasis would go out of business,'' <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said. `` I'd hope one day there'd be no need for special ministries. This is just a stepping stone.''

 Nineteen months after Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> went to war against populist tradition, he claims several victories, owns up to a major defeat and admits he needs to do a better job dealing with legislators. But <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, a self-styled reformer who unseated three-term Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> in 1987, said he wo n't back off from a pledge against `` good-old boy'' dealings. `` I do n't want anybody to be disappointed in the fact that <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> has gotten a little older and hopefully a little wiser. `` I can be legitimately criticized for many things ... but I do n't think you can say after a year and a half that this is a political office.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s drive to enact an ambitious agenda have been met recently with anger from legislators. His style _ part bulldog and part evangelical minister _ worked against him during debates over the state's tax system and a divisive budget-balancing fight this year, some lawmakers said. `` He has had the attitude that it's his way or no way,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Alario </PERSON>, who was ousted as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker last year at <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s insistence. `` He should know better. He came up as a legislator through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and he knows that's not the way it works. For some reason, he let it go to his head and ran all over everyone and that's not a way a democracy should work,'' When <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> took office in March 1988, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> faced an accumulated deficit of $ 900 million and ranked near the top of the unemployment list and at the bottom of most education categories. He convinced the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to give him temporary fiscal authority unlike any since <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who ruled with fiat and a rubber-stamp <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In the first few months of <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s term, an education reform bill gave teachers pay raises, the state's long-term debt was bonded out and the giant agency handling public welfare programs was split in half and reorganized. An office of inspector general, headed by a former newspaper investigative newspaper reporter, was activated to root out corruption and mismanagement. The governor also pledged to bring in new business to end <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s dependence on the volatile petroleum industry, and to clean up the environment _ goals often seen as conflicting. The Department of Environmental Quality was beefed up and the Legislature this year passed a tough clean air act. All the way, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> fought with the `` evil part of our past.'' `` I am a politician. I like politics. I do n't consider it a pejorative word. But in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> it had become that over time. Excuses not to move, factions. It has not been surpising to me, but depressing, to spend so much time on political warfare.'' The governor wound up on the losing side when he tried to change <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s populist tax system, which leaned heavily on business and has often been described as `` do n't tax you, do n't tax me, tax the guy behind the tree.'' One attempt to shift the load to individuals through income tax failed in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in October 1988; a second passed in March only to be rejected by voters in April. The fallout was an acrimonious fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> over the current state budget, a revolt led by his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor leader that forced acceptance of a sales tax to balance spending, and speculation <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> already had moved into the ranks of the lame ducks. `` Even the political enemies of that wanted it to pass. I'll say it for the public record. They wanted it to pass because they knew it was the answer.'' The governor believes he has recovered from the downturn in popularity as gauged by post-session media polls, but does n't know yet whether he will seek a second term. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> already has said he's thinking about another bid and other candidates from 1987 are believed to be looking at the 1991 race. `` I need to do a lot of things,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` Fundamental changes are so important for this state to survive that if I feel a year, a year and a half from now that to finish the job, I've got to stay, then I'm going to ask the voters to keep me. But I never want to make that desire to be paramount in my mind and in the actions that take place here.'' Voters on Oct. 17 approved a major part of the tax package, a $ 1.4 billion highway improvement program funded by a 4-cent increase in gasoline taxes, but <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said it's too early to decide on a third attempt at fiscal revision. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> `` called me and told me that it took the second year of his second term to get it done,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said, he will concentrate on selling <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to new industry and spend less time in the step-by-step legislative process. `` That's not what I do best, but I had to do it. `` It's time to put that to rest for a while and let me be governor. Let me represent this state, sell the state, move people in terms of the feelings about the state. I'm enjoying this part of my term.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> also is modifying his approach to dealing with legislators. A former state representative, <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, was brought in as chief of staff and several members of the staff have departed _ voluntarily and involuntarily. `` The more ` we' I can put into this and the less ` me' I can put into this, the more better off we are,'' he said, adding that his future dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would be `` a little less confrontational. We do n't have to win every fight, we do n't even have to fight every fight.'' <PERSON> Alario </PERSON> is reserving judgment. `` What he says he's going to do and what he does often does n't come out the same way.''

 You can tell the old, retired, slightly rundown gumshoe is back on the job. He offers his younger brother, an ex-cop, a pint of <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s Select Irish Whiskey to help out. `` House brand,'' he explains. So it goes for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanner </PERSON>, Private Eye.'' But his new movie, airing Nov. 15 on the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, is not the `` Farewell My Lovely'' or `` The Big Sleep'' kind of classic <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> detective movie. `` This is a complete charade,'' <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> says of this cable venture, which co-stars his brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, as the ex-cop; a son, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, as a cop, and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgnine </PERSON> as retired mobster <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> `` The Salami'' Piccolo. The film, he reports, includes one scene `` with a bunch of naked girls around the pool. I think it's all done very discreetly.'' Students of the cinema may consider `` Spanner'' close in spoof spirit to <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>'s `` His Kind of Woman.'' That 1951 epic makes one suspect that, during filming, the cast partook of strong drink and had fun. `` I do n't remember what it was all about,'' <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> insists. He does recall the fun part. And that producer <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> made the cast film it twice, the idea being to make a good film a great one. That was no fun, he says. <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>, whose more recent work includes the two <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> mega-miniseries, `` War and Remembrance'' and `` Winds of War,'' has a dry, sardonic sense of humor befitting a star who has logged 46 years in movies and TV movies. Now 72, he has been around and about. His early days dossier includes ditch-digging; a shot at boxing; assistant to the astrologer <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Righter </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, and writing for radio. That should prepare a man for anything, particularly writing scripts where the producers, he recalls, `` would say ` we need 17 pages by Wednesday,' and they would n't say 17 pages of what.'' He laughs when asked if he ever feels he could write a better script than many offered him. `` Well, I've just shown the attitude that <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> had. He said, ` If they want'em bad, kid, we can make'em bad, too.''' <PERSON> Fortuneatly </PERSON>, his first substantial role, one that got him an Oscar nomination in 1945, was in a good movie. He played the war-weary infantry captain in `` The Story of G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' a film based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning column by war correspondent <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>. His first insubstantial roles were in 1943, in `` Hopalong Cassidy'' movies. He had no trepidations about becoming an actor then, he says, only about getting his horse to go forward and to stop: `` I did n't know how to ride a horse, really. As a matter of fact, I did n't know if you were supposed to bring your own horse.'' <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>'s plain, sleepy-eyed, unpretentious style often has won acclaim, that usually occurring when he likes the movie he's in. Away from the cameras, he avoids the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> ramble. He is a private man. He packs a tight suitcase, odd but nice in an era when it takes a two-by-four to stop a star from talking about his or her personal life. It is known, however, that <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> has played guitar and likes jazz guitarists such as <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>. But he quit as a player a long time ago, he says: `` There are too many good ones.'' He also has written poetry. But again, that's history, he insists: `` No. I never see anything but the back of a check to sign now.'' Still, he likes `` all the coherent poets,'' particularly <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wordsworth </PERSON>, the English romantic. This sparks a memory of a time a Wordworth passage even showed up in a film he made with <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. Doing a fine basso version of her distinctive speech pattern, <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> recalls that, reading the script, she `` comes up and says ` The world is too much with us late ends soon,''' and then demands, `` Who said that?'' `` I said, ` Nobody ever said that.' She said, ` What?' I said, ` What the hell's it mean?''' They repaired to the studio's library to check the line and its punctuation, <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> recalls. Then, the actor with a rep for playing tough guys proceeds to surprise his listener by quoting part of the passage from memory: `` The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our powers ...''

<HEAD>Tax Away Stock Market Volatility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s view, the remedy for extreme stock market volatility might lie more in tax reforms than in restraints imposed by the exchanges or regulators. His suggestion: `` How about a 40 percent tax on assets held less than 90 days, 28 percent up to two years, 15 percent up to five years, and after that the tax rate goes to zero?'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> expressed his views in a recent speech to magazine publishers and editors in which he stressed the need for Americans to take the long-term view in building the economy, the better to compete with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It's crazy, he said, `` but the whole country seems to be in a short-term feeding frenzy _ make a quick buck and get out, look out for yourself, live for today. And the hell with the future.'' The blunt-speaking chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he would also include a modest tax on huge pension funds, which pay no capital gains taxes and whose trading practices are sometimes blamed for volatility. Such measures, he suggested, would force Americans to take a long-term view _ to think as investors rather than traders. As importantly, a longer-term view would allow corporate managers to develop their own long-term thinking, especially regarding improvements that would strengthen a company but not pay off immediately, he indicated. `` Do you think more companies would be building research and development centers if they did n't pay a penalty in their stock price for investing in such long-term assets?'' he asked, adding: `` We're upside down in the world by penalizing savings and investment and ecnouraging borrowing and consumption.'' He offered two other tax suggestions: 1. Increase federal revenues with a consumption law, beginning with gasoline. In fact, he said, `` start moving our whole tax base more toward consumption. Tap into the underground economy for a change.'' 2. `` Stop all this -LRB- corporate -RRB- takeover nonsense by requiring a stock to be held for six months before its voting rights can be exercised,'' and in addition eliminate interest deductions on debt incurred for hostile takeovers. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s attack on short-term thinking was broadly based. Educators, he said, were guilty of permitting the highest functional illiteracy rate in the industrial world. It worries him, he said, that one of every four Americans `` ca n't read our damn ads!'' He said the short-term view was also a malady of politicians, `` because they're always running for office.'' He observed that elected officials must always be prepared to answer one question: `` What have you done for me lately?'' But many of his most penetrating observations were in reference to Wall Streeters, a `` gang'' that he said were short-termers almost by definition. `` Brokers and analysts make money betting right on what a company does every 90 days,'' he said. `` Whether that company will be stronger than ever or bankrupt in three years is almost irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> made his remarks Oct. 23 at a combined meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. Hoping for wider distribution, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> distributed copies of the speech this week.

 The second-graders fidgeted and giggled as they filed into <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and settled into their desks after being bused three blocks from public school. Arms shot up as they vied to read a sign taped to the chalkboard: `` Only kind words are spoken here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Westwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> pupils are among thousands of public school children across the country who receive Bible instruction during school hours from private groups that conduct classes off school property. Whether in permanent classrooms or in buses or trailers parked just off school grounds, the classes are a way around the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ban on religious teaching and prayer in the public schools, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Released </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a marvelous alternative and provides an access for a need expressed by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people at large,'' <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> said. The court, while banning religion in public schools, has upheld providing off-campus religious instruction during the school day. `` When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions,'' the court held in a 1952 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case. `` To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that government show callous indifference to religious groups.'' Even though released time has been affirmed by the court, the concept may not be immune to challenge, said <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, an attorney for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> who is studying the possibility of filing a lawsuit, although he has not decided on what grounds. `` I would n't rule out a general challenge at this time,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> might be asked to reconsider the issue.'' But advocates believe they are on firm legal ground. `` In the'80s, we have been picking up momentum, and in the'90s there will be tremendous growth if I have anything to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>. The thousands of children in all grades enrolled in such programs in 19 states still are only a fraction of the nation's 40.3 million full-time public school students, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Traister </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a member of the NARTCE board It's hard to provide an exact figure for released-time enrollment because many programs `` operate on shoestring and do n't report enrollment because they want to avoid legal challenges,'' <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> said The mere filing of a lawsuit could end the programs because of the cost of hiring a lawyer. Although any religion may provide released-time instruction, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups have had a virtual monopoly on the practice since released time began in 1914 in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, with non-denominational Weekday Religious Education. Weekday Religious Education was provided in the public schools until the practice was banned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1948, when about 2 million children were participating in WRE programs nationwide. The ruling forced the programs off school grounds, but did n't temper the fervor of those attempting to provide Bible education `` There were threats of court suits that so many school boards weakened,'' said <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, coordinator of <ORGANIZATION> Weekday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The programs survived where they were strongest.'' She insisted that the programs, usually financed by churches and individuals, is not a circumvention of the high court's ban, but is `` really the only way you can get to the large population of young children, about 40 percent of whom have no church connection.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riffee </PERSON>, who heads the released-time program in <LOCATION> Nottoway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, said the instruction is important because public schools are giving children humanism, `` keeping God out of the schools.'' `` We need to have these youngsters exposed to the Bible,'' he said. The 60-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> program has 14,000 students, the largest in the nation, Miss <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The weekly or monthly classes, which usually last 30 minutes to an hour, must be approved by school boards, and children who participate need written permission from parents. The classes, which run through the academic year, are conducted during school hours because that is when `` we can get such a large percentage of the children.'' The age of the students varies with the 13 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> localities that have programs; the participation rate is about 85 percent, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Whether a community has released time is up to the local school board, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fondriat </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` The state does not get involved in this at all.'' The children in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON>'s class at Westminster Presbyterian are among more than 700 in <LOCATION> Waynesboro </LOCATION> students who participate in the program. The <ORGANIZATION> Waynesboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WRE </ORGANIZATION>, which has its own bus to transport children, offers `` a straightforward presentation of the Bible,'' biblical history and geography, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who directs the program. The 55-minute classes generally are held during recess or physical education class. `` They do n't miss any regular instruction,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, an aide to the <LOCATION> Waynesboro </LOCATION> school superintendent, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON>. Released-time curricula are as varied as the groups that provide them. While Traister's CBM Ministries stresses memorization of Bible passages, the <ORGANIZATION> Haversham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cornelia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, offers `` no biblical studies whatever,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, its director of development. The center, 50 yards from <ORGANIZATION> Haversham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, offers a program for teen-agers that builds self-esteem and communication skills while focusing on preventing pregnancy and suicide and helping teens get along with parents. But `` we do n't hesitate to open a class with a prayer,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who also is a director of the 5-year-old NARTCE. Miss <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> dismissed any suggestion that children not enrolled in released time at schools with high participation are stigmatized. Children who stay behind are with their teachers, who provide enrichment activities, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence of being stigmatized. There is a lot less of stereotyping of students by their peers than by parents.'' But a mother whose 8-year-old son does n't participate said there is `` a lot of peer pressure'' to join. `` The classroom teacher would single my child out. He did n't want to go to school,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` I do n't believe it belongs during school time.''

 After an aged Indian woman, <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snake </PERSON>, lost her husband when he and his two mules were killed by lightning while plowing, his younger brother dutifully married the widow. That obligation is part of the religious traditions of the <ORGANIZATION> Delawares </ORGANIZATION> and some other tribes, matching a responsibility laid down in the biblical laws of ancient Judaism. `` The similarities of early native American religions and ancient Hebrew religion are astonishing,'' says historian <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> tribe, a researcher of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>. He also notes congruent strains with early Christianity, such as Indian expectations of a Christ-like benefactor and emphasis on communal sharing of everything in common and on modesty by not calling attention to oneself. `` All American Indians were _ and most are today _ deeply religious and devoted to their belief in one supreme being,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said in an interview. He discounted past charactertizations of some old tribal rites as pagan. `` I do n't think it's pagan to go up on a mountain and pray to try to get a vision,'' he said, describing the `` vision quest'' of the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> and some other tribes. `` It's similar to what the biblical prophets did.'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, 47, former co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and now with the university's institute here, researches and writes tribal histories. Since 1983, he has completed them for six tribes. He also conducts training workshops to help Indians across the country learn how to preserve tribal lore. Participants have come from about 200 of the nation's 300 recognized tribes. Thirty-seven of them have tribal headquarters in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which remained mostly Indian territory until 1907. The university's Western History Collections library is considered the best existing on the plains tribes While Indians generally have depended on handing down their religious traditions orally, `` there's a great danger they will be lost,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` In many cases they have been. `` There are not enough Indian histories. Many of the elders are dying, and I try to teach them to write their histories. Some are beginning to record it and put it in locked files only for the tribe.'' While Indian religion sometimes is portrayed as highly distinct from biblical faith, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> sees definite resemblances, judging on the basis of his advanced biblical studies as well as first-hand inquiries into Indian religion. `` Christianity and early Indian religion have been so interwoven that it is often difficult now to tell which came first for them,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. Of 1.4 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Indians, most are Christians but many also retain tribal insights, he said. The Native American Church, which combines both Christianity and native religion, stemmed from the `` ghost dance'' religion started in the 1890s by a Paiute Indian from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wewoka </LOCATION>, preaching return of the buffalo and <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> to lift up the downtrodden. `` It spread like wildfire,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said, adding that it uses the hallucigenic peyote bean `` as a sacrament,'' which also is used in a `` limited way'' in some other tribal religions. He said these also make extensive use of chants, the drum, the four directions, the circle, the smoked pipe and smoke from burning cedar waved about by a feather to ward off evil. However, religious details vary from tribe to tribe, and often remain obscure, since there were no reliably balanced accounts of Indian concepts for the first 100 years of contacts with Europeans, he said. On how he determines what religious elements are originally Indian, he said: `` I only accept what the elders tell me is true. Some of it possibly came from back there in the seed of missionaries to some degree. At this point, nobody knows absolutely.'' Yet some biblical-type ideas among Indians seem definitely their own, such as views of humanity's creation, a great flood, afterlife and anticipated return of some variously named special teacher _ such as `` Nanaboosh'' or `` Great White Rabbit.'' `` In Indian religion everything is related to nature,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` There's a special relatedness with animals and geographical features, sacred mountains, sacred rivers, sacred places. Natural forces are intermeshed with supernatural beliefs.'' Some Indian religious rituals are confined to the tribe. While <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> has been allowed in various secret ceremonies beyond his own tribe, he said, `` There are things you're not going to see nor find out about on the outside.'' Asked about the secrecy, he said: `` Everything the Indian has shared with the white man has disappeared. The only way to keep something is keep it within.'' He emphasized that tribal beliefs focus on a monotheistic God, called by various names such as the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> `` Wakan Tanka'' or <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> `` Great Manitu,'' names with such meanings as `` Great Spirit'' or `` He Who Makes Everything.'' <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snake </PERSON>, the remarried <ORGANIZATION> Anadarko </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, widow in her mid-90s, her memories going back to early Indian ways, was quoted as saying, `` We always knew God and prayed to him.''

 <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> says her new comedy series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> brings out her motherly instincts. <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>, who has no children, plays the mother of 14-year-old actress <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieffel </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>,'' as the show is called. `` She makes me miss having a teen-age daughter,'' she said. `` Our relationship is the whole basis of the show. I've just lost a husband and she's lost a father and we're very supportive of each other. It's a comedy, but it's about self-esteem, friendship and trust. There are a lot of young people in the show, but always the focus is on that magical relationship between a mother and daughter.'' The series marks <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>'s return to regular television after numerous TV movies and miniseries. In 1985 she underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer. Her last series was a brief return to `` It's a Living'' when the former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy was picked up for syndication. She starred in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Jennifer Slept Here'' in 1983-84, and as a child she was in `` <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> also stars with <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Little White Lies,'' a romantic comedy filmed partially on location in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Both the movie and premiere of the series were tentatively set for late November or early December. In `` <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>,'' she plays a recently widowed woman who moves to a small <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town where she and her husband spent their honeymoon. She takes a job in a Victorian-style shop that sells coffee, jams, cookies and muffins. `` Our dream had been to return to the town,'' she said. `` You know, with the porch swing and everything. But her husband was killed on the job as a fireman.'' She calls `` Little White Lies'' her reintroduction to the audience before the premiere of `` <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>.'' Her last movie was `` Original Sin,'' telecast by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last February. `` This is the first funny thing I've done in years,'' she said. `` The past four or five things I've done have all been dramas. I'm not complaining I got three Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations. I won a Golden Globe for ` The <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>.''' That movie told of her battle against cancer. In `` Little White Lies,'' <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> plays a policewoman who goes to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on vacation and meets a doctor played by <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. However, each lies to the other and makes up a phony background. She tells <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> she's a business executive and he tells her he's a hospital orderly. She wants to keep her identity secret because she thinks men want to date her so she can fix traffic tickets. He's afraid that women only want to go out with him because they want to marry a doctor. `` We were in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for only three days, so we spent long hours in front of the camera,'' said <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>, who was accompanied by her husband and manager, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Murcia </PERSON>. `` We started before dawn each day and worked until late at night. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> and I had been there on vacation a month before so we were able to suggest the best places to film.'' Her husband makes his film debut in `` Little White Lies'' as a loudmouth American tourist. `` He plays a patient of <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>'s who nearly gives away his phony identity,'' she said. `` I felt like a stage mother. I wanted to tell <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, ` Smile, baby.' He hit his marks and was great. `` If the movie does well in the ratings we could do some sequels. The chemistry between <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and I was wonderful, which you really need for a romantic comedy. We had to do a lot of kissing and after a while it became technical just figuring out how to do it different each time. We had one kissing scene in which the cinematographer caught a flash of gold light behind us as the sun sparkled on the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the dome of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s at the Vatican.'' <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> went through some training at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and talked to some women detectives to prepare for her role. She also got some pointers from her husband, a former police sergeant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> showed me how to use a gun, although my character does n't use one in the picture,'' she said `` He showed me simple things like how to flip a badge. I'd come home from filming and talk police jargon and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> would laugh. He said: ` It's a trade. I'm an actor now and you're a cop.'''

 At <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s place, even the senators wear blue jeans. For years, this rustic mountain resort was the private hideaway of Redford the movie star. But now, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> the environmental activist has opened it to a high-powered crowd. He's enlisting politicians, business leaders, scientists and others to help him find common ground in the polarized landscape of environmental politics. Lured by <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s fame, they play by <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s rules: Leave the stiff collars and rigid ideologies at home; relax and try to see opponents as at least partly human. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> has long been known as one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s premier do-gooders, using the rugged, casual charm that launched his film career to call attention to environmental issues. But as times change, so does <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. At 52, he has softened the radical edges that marked his early activism. Since 1983, when he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, he has been more mediator than instigator, drawing together adversaries in disputes such as <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil exploration and energy development on Navajo lands. The normally low-key institute took a higher profile in August by sponsoring `` Greenhouse Glasnost.'' It was an unusual meeting of American and Soviet officials, scientists, environmentalists and entertainers designed to highlight the threat of global warming due to the greenhouse effect. Last month, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> tackled nuclear energy, bringing together industry representatives and environmentalists at Sundance to debate whether the nation's struggling nuclear power industry should be revived. Activism is nothing new to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where almost every cause has its celebrity champion. But <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, in an interview, explained that his passion for the environment long preceded his stardom. He was 10 years old, recovering from a mild case of polio, when his mother took him to Yosemite National Park. He was awestruck. `` I said to myself, ` That's it _ I want to be a part of that.' `` I shifted right then. I spent more time outdoors. I started to hike. I went to Yosemite to work, and I learned to climb there.'' His native <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, booming after World War II, also affected him. `` The air was going bad. The fruit groves were disappearing and giving way to malls and suburbs. Everybody just came and grabbed what they could grab and built what they could build. I took that personally. I wanted out of there.'' His wanderings took him to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But he knew in 1961 that he had found home when he and his wife, <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagenen </PERSON>, bought two acres in a canyon near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timpanagos </LOCATION>. Here, in the rugged beauty of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>, he could ski some of the West's finest powder and find the empty, silent spaces he craved. He expanded the homestead as his film career gained speed. After several successful movies in the late'60s, culminating with `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' he bought nearly the whole canyon, complete with a rundown ski resort. He named it after his character in the movie. But he soon discovered he could n't hide from the development pressures that had forced him from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Highway officials proposed widening the <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> road, which passes near <LOCATION> Sundance </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> campaigned against it, arguing the project would help only truckers while ruining a peaceful canyon and a popular trout-fishing stream. That local involvement led to environmental battles around the country. He lent his name to liberal political candidates; he showed up at scenic rivers and toxic waste sites; he lobbied for energy-conservation laws. In 1975, a consortium of utilities proposed building a coal-fired power plant on <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Kaiparowits Plateau. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> researched the project, concluded it was a boondoggle, and jumped into the fray. The project was shelved, and <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> was burned in effigy by angry opponents. Despite his victories, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> disliked the contentiousness of environmental politics and the `` boneheaded arguments'' he heard on both sides. His presence publicized issues, but it also heightened opposition. `` You were almost canceling yourself out,'' he said. He founded the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> so he could take a quieter, less inflammatory role. It complements another <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> organization also dedicated to the human factor. His Sundance Institute has sponsored film, dance and screenwriting workshops at the resort since 1980, helping independent artists pursue their visions without the pressure to `` go commercial.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRM </ORGANIZATION> works on the premise that nobody, including an industrialist, wants to destroy the planet. Typically the institute puts adversaries together in a room for a few days and lets them seek their own solutions. Not all conferences occur at Sundance. One of the institute's best-known attempts to reach common ground started at sea _ and nearly sank there It was August 1985, the issue was oil drilling in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> thought a pleasure cruise in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Morro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> would ease tensions between the oil executives and environmentalists who had reluctantly agreed to meet. But the adversaries were n't talking, and the boat started heaving in 9-foot waves. `` Pretty soon everyone was sick,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said. `` The image of environmentalists and industry heads throwing up together was something I wo n't forget. I also thought it was the end of our organization.'' It proved instead to be the human factor he seeks, eroding participants' reserve. The conference led to an extraordinary agreement that recommended drilling in some areas and placing others off-limits. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say they adopted many of the agreement's provisions in their <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> drilling plans _ though not enough to satisfy <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, who still contends the agency `` shelved it.'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> manages to avoid the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> penchant for all flash and little substance, said <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke of the actor-activist's `` vision and hard work. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> also is gaining some friends in industry. His old nemesis from the Kaiparowits battle _ <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> _ now is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> IRM </ORGANIZATION> board. `` In recent years,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, `` he has developed a cautious respect for productivity, economic considerations and balance.'' He's also developing new ways to integrate his film career and environmental interests. His two institutes collaborated this year on a documentary, narrated by <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, about Yosemite. And last year <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> directed `` The Milagro Beanfield War,'' in which poor New Mexican villagers battle a recreational development. The villagers win, of course. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s own development at Sundance aims to complement nature. Architectural Digest recently praised the resort's attempt to `` echo the canyon's geology'' with rough-hewn siding and old tree-trunk columns that help the auditorium, lodge and guest cottages blend into the background. Once a year, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> requires all Sundance employees to drop their usual tasks and plant a tree. At the global warming conference, while speeches droned on, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> sometimes gazed wistfully out the window at children playing by a pond. It was the human factor again. `` At the point when people start repeating themselves, or the same person wants more time on the floor, that's the time to get out,'' he said. `` That's the time to go plant a tree.''

<HEAD>USDA Report Says General Economy Has Good Vibes for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Improvements in the global economy and a steadier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar are helping boost the outlook for American farmers in the year ahead, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaco </PERSON> say. `` Solid foreign growth prospects and only modest changes in the value of the dollar point to continued moderate export increases,'' they say. `` So, export demand will continue to put some pressure on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing capacity, increasing the likelihood that spending on new plants and equipment will continue.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, writing in the November issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said general economic growth `` looks likely to be mildly supportive of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture'' over the next six to 12 months. In their review, the two economists said assessments of the general economic situation have changed considerably over the last year, `` shifting progressively'' across three main possibilities: an inflation spiral similar to that of the late 1970s, an eased monetary policy induced by recession, and recently a `` decelerating export growth'' due to the rise in value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar abroad. `` Adroit policymaking and midyear commodity price slides have eliminated the first two possibilities as probable outcomes over the coming six months,'' the report said. `` The current expansion is virtually assured to last well past its seventh birthday -LRB- this month -RRB-.'' But economic forecasting is not without pitfalls and rollercoaster thrills. Consider what has happened in the last couple of years. In early 1988, many economists speculated about rising inflation and another upward price spiral that could spell trouble in the months and even years ahead. By mid-1988, the report said, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> warned it might be necessary to cool off the economy. Interest rates began to rise. Consumer prices, which rose 1.8 percent in 1986 and 3.6 percent in 1987, rose 4.1 percent in 1988. And in the first quarter of 1989 overall consumer prices grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent, while producer prices jumped 10.2 percent. `` But food and energy price hikes accounted for most of inflation's quickend pace,'' the report said. `` Producer prices for finished food products rose 5.2 percent in 1988, but spurted an annualized 13.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, perhaps because of -LRB- last year's -RRB- drought.'' Producer prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline and heating oil jumped at an annual rate of 41 percent in the first three months of 1989, mainly because of tighter <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production restrictions and global oil mishaps. `` Rising interest rates began to take a toll on interest sensitive components of demand, housing and autos in particular,'' the report said. `` The economy slowed sufficiently that by the middle of the second quarter of this year, fears of an impending recession replaced worries over spiraling inflation,'' the report said. With inflation easing, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eased back on monetary policy to ward off recession, and interest rates came down. A third-quarter <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> survey of anticipated spending for plants and equipment suggested continued robust growth. `` As inflation and recession fears dissipated during the first three quarters of 1989, concern began to mount about the rising value of the dollar,'' the report said. `` By September, the dollar was up 12 percent from the first of the year.'' A rising dollar tends to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export volume and increase imports by raising the prices of goods sold to foreign countries and reducing prices of items imported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` While the dollar has gone up throughout 1989, it is still about 37 percent below its historic peak in 1985,'' the report said. `` Some analysts associated the recent rise with climbing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and relatively slow money growth. With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates flat or slightly falling, some now expect the dollar's value to diminish.'' Forecasts by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> indicate that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar movments are likely to be modest over the next few months, growth in major developed countries `` suggest continued healthy demand'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, the report said.

<HEAD>Unix Rivals to Step Up Talks on Cooperation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rivals for control of the Unix software standard say they are expanding discussions on cooperation that could lead to a healing of the split between them. The statement Monday was good news for computer users, who have been pressing hard for a single Unix standard. Unix is a base layer of software that makes it possible for programs to run on many different kinds of computers, the same way compact discs can be played on many different brands of compact disc players. Unix is split now between a group that includes <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the originator of Unix, and a rival camp whose main members are <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The split means that programs written for one version of Unix wo n't necessarily work with the other version. The latest <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T version was released last week, while the one from the rival <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is due out in late 1990. `` What we're trying to do is remove the assumption and perception that we're all competing with each other,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tory </PERSON>, the president and chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. `` We genuinely want to converge, both parties, and the industry wants us to as well,'' <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> said. Discussions have been going on for the past year, and if they go well they may lead to `` something big and dramatic'' around the end of this year, said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, director of system software for the company's Unix software operation. Even if the talks do n't result in a major breakthrough, the two groups will continue working on areas of cooperation in the area of open software, <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, Digital and others formed the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in May 1988 out of fear that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was controlling Unix for its own commercial advantage. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T attempted to allay such fears by ceding control of Unix standards to an independent group called <ORGANIZATION> Unix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, of which it is a member.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> logo will appear in a new Nintendo video game, making <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> the first soft drink maker to tap into electronic games for commercial exposure, the companies said. Under an agreement announced Monday between <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tradewest </LOCATION>, which is licensed to manufacture video games for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s logo will be featured in Magic Johnson's Fast Break. The professional-style video basketball game, to be released early next year, is set in an arena packed with cheering fans. The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> name appears in the game's opening title sequence and on signs at courtside. The soft drink maker's logo also is on the scoreboard shown at the end of each quarter. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s identification in the game mirrors the real life display of logos and banners that adorn athletic venues across the country,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president of marketing and national sales. The amount of money <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is paying to be a make-belive game sponsor was not disclosed. Only one other company ever has had its symbol shown in a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game. The Racket Attack game used the logo of the <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> tennis racket and sporting goods manufacturer. The hookup between <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> is part of a trend that has developed as companies search for alternative advertising outlets. `` As traditional advertising mediums become increasingly cluttered and segmented, advertisers must respond creatively,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The proliferation of commercials on television plus changes in viewing habits _ including the widespread use of video cassette recorders and the practice of changing channels to zap past commercials _ has persuaded advertisers to promote products in new ways. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> has had some experience and success with nontraditional marketing methods. For instance in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> placed the first commercial ever on a home video cassette, putting the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> `` Mustang'' ad was placed on the film `` Top Gun.'' The beverage giant says video games potentially are a major marketing medium. It is estimated that nearly 26 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households will own a video game machine by the end of this year. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment system that turns a TV set into a game screen is projected to be in 22 percent of American homes by the end of this year. Nintendo of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, dominates the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic games market Some of its most popular titles feature the mustachioed <ORGANIZATION> Mario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> already has a promotional alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> on a $ 10 million national campaign for the holiday season. During the two-month campaign, which began Nov. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> will give away thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s newest gadget, the Game Boy hand-held video game, through contests and sweepstakes. Other Nintendo and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> products also will be available through the promotion.

<HEAD>Chrysler on a Crash Diet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Times are tough again for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has launched a crash diet to shed $ 1 billion in expenses in 14 months, but the atmosphere that led to concession contracts in the early 1980s is n't present this time around. `` There is a lot of bad news that's coming all at once,'' analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Monday `` But I think management should be given credit for taking the initiative for what the market is going to be like in the 1990s.'' On Jan. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the carmaking arm of the company, will cease to exist as a separate division, spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Monday. No key personnel or titles will change, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` We're merging <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> into <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the legal entity of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> goes away,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` The move is purely technical, legal and tax-oriented. It will not have any impact on people or titles and will not change the company's internal or external operation in any way. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> declined to say how much tax money the company expects to save because of the move. That news comes on the heels of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Friday that it will stop car production at its <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in February, more than a year earlier than originally anticipated, will cut one of two shifts at its carmaking plant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and close a parts plant in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> next year. About 4,000 hourly workers will be affected. The consolidation involves the elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompact models. Within the next year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will face increasing competition for its two most profitable vehicles _ Jeeps and minivans _ and will deal with lower earnings due to the projected softening in the North American auto market. And it will sit down at the bargaining table with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in charge of the union's <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, sounded an ominous note as the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> prepares preliminary work toward negotiations next summer. `` This decision is bound to have a detrimental impact on our future relations,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Friday. `` It reinforces the view that the corporation's commitment to retaining the good faith and loyalty of its workers is sorely lacking when the going gets tough.'' While things are tough for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> this year, they are n't the same as they were a decade ago, when Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was haunting the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> looking for guarantees for millions of dollars in state and federal loans. A dozen years ago, interest rates and gasoline prices were much higher than now and the Japanese auto invasion was gearing up to rob <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers of their market share. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had to go to the federal government to guarantee millions of dollars in loans to keep it afloat. It also went to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> with contracts calling for worker concessions. During the 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> agreed to modify work rules at some plants and to cooperate on everything from factory floor decisions to those made in the board room. In 1990, for the first time in years, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts with the Big Three expire on the same day, Sept. 14. And an end may be at hand to the practice of `` pattern bargaining,'' in which the union targets one company, reaches a contract with it and then signs similar agreements with the other two, said labor analyst <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>. `` What you're going to see is contracts tailored to individual corporations,'' said <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Industrial Relations at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in East Lansing. `` The old theory of pattern bargaining is a dead duck.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> says that's bunk. `` We just got back to pattern bargaining again and that's exactly where we'll stay,'' he said Monday `` Chrysler's profits are still way up from where they were during the lean time.'' In the first nine months of 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.48 billion; during the same time this year, it made $ 717.5 million. `` They are getting too worried about their stockholders and not enough about their workers,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Southland To Sell Citgo Stake To Venezuelan Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest convenience store retailer, says it will step out of the oil business and realize a more than threefold return on its 6-year-old investment in <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 by issuing $ 254 million in stock, sold half of the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based company in 1986 to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venezuela </ORGANIZATION> for $ 290 million On Monday, it announced plans to sell the other half to the Venezuelan company for $ 675 million. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> said terms of the agreement had not been completed and remain subject to an acceptable definitive agreement. The sale would give the Dallas-based operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain a boost as it works to continue meeting huge debt payments resulting from the company's $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout in 1987 that took the company private. The deal also would give <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> a greater <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share for its crude oil. The transaction would make <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> the first large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company to be acquired by a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have carried out a campaign of acquiring the `` downstream'' side of the oil business _ refining and distribution facilities _ in order to guarantee access to industrialized markets in the face of falling oil prices during the last decade. The <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> purchase comes on the heels of a joint venture formed last week by <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venezuela </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that includes 50 percent shares of major assets such as <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> refinery near <LOCATION> Lemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Petroleos de <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also bought Jan. 1 the half-interest in a <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> refinery from <LOCATION> Champlin </LOCATION> Refining that it did not already Last year, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> paid $ 1.28 billion for half of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing operations in 23 Eastern and Gulf Coast states. One of <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION>'s principal assets is the nation's eighth-largest refinery, located in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>. The refinery is able to efficiently convert low-grade crude oil into high octane fuel. <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION>, created from the refinery, marketing and transportation operations of the old <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, earned $ 165.6 million on $ 4.1 billion in revenues last year, a 24 percent increase in sales. In the quarter ended June 30, earnings were $ 39.2 million on $ 1.3 billion in sales, compared with $ 33.9 million on $ 1.02 billion in sales in the year-ago quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>, taken private by the founding <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> family in the 1987 buyout, said in May it would seek ways to cash in on its interest in <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION>, and the sale price is in the range analysts had expected. The Venezuelan company has first rights in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s stake. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> has some large payments coming due on its debt, with $ 258 million due Dec. 31 and an additional $ 250 million due through next year. Some analysts have questioned <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to meet those payments, but the company has disputed those forecasts. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> said it would continue as a prime retailer of <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> products. In the quarter ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 67.01 million. Besides the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> refinery, Petroleos de <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> will acquire pipelines running from the refinery to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 43 oil terminals and access to 300 other terminals scattered across the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> supplies 6 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation fuel market, 5 percent of the lubricant market and 4 percent of service station sales. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also owns part of four refineries in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and the huge <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Curacao </LOCATION>, capable of processing 300,000 barrels a day. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in 1988 processed about 945,000 barrels a day of refined oil inside <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and 630,000 barrels in its overseas refining operations, placing it among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders in refined oil production.

<TEXT>
 While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese negotiators resumed talks on how to eliminate structural barriers that have contributed to the $ 50 billion trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, American business leaders were telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> why the talks were needed. They told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Monday that they are more interested in opening up Japanese markets than protecting American markets. The business leaders also told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s international trade subcommittee that changes are needed on both sides of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to solve the U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s systems for buying and distributing goods are the biggest obstacle facing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who export or do business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of international trade policy for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. He and other witnesses complained about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s distribution system under which firms purchase parts and supplies almost exclusively from long-term business partners and companies either make their own supplies or keep tight reins over their suppliers. But <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who just returned from a monthlong trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, added: `` We should not kid ourselves. We can not expect real help from the Japanese in reducing their surplus or our deficit unless we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can demonstrate the very great importance we attach to constructive change in this area.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kertzman </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We believe the imbalance in commercial relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will destroy the international trading system unless it is effectively addressed.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are only $ 6.3 billion per year, compared with $ 26.8 billion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He also said there must be changes in this country. `` Frankly, it is our hope that our Japanese friends will press the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to deal with its own economic problems that impact the bilateral trading relationship. High among these problems is the high cost of capital driven by our enormous budget deficit and our tax system which favors consumption over savings and investment,'' he added. A harder line was taken by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman and sometime corporate raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, who called corporate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` a closed shop.'' He said the `` most damaging'' structural barrier to free trade was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` cartel-like system of interlocking corporate ownership.'' Because of that, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> claimed, `` a relatively small group of insiders dictate corporate policy. He said his own problem with <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese auto headlight maker, `` is symbolic of the current trade relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, known for his often hostile raids on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, has been battling with the management of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> for representation on its board. But he has been rebuffed despite his 26 percent stake in the company. `` The entire system of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is geared toward the denial of a meaningful flow of information to shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. Nearly all the day's speakers supported the continuing structural impediment initiative talks between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese representatives. The talks, first held Sept. 4 and 5 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, are an outgrowth of a White House decision in May that found <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> responsible for restrictive trade and investment practices under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to discuss a number of `` structural impediments'' outside the procedures and timetables of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade laws.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for payments to tens of thousands of women injured by the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION>, but one attorney said `` ultimate justice can never be done'' for victims of the birth control device. The high court on Monday rejected a challenge by 650 women to a $ 2.5 billion trust for victims of the intrauterine device made by <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The fund was established by Richmond-based <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 amid a flood of claims because of the Dalkon Shield. The ruling means women injured by the IUD could begin receiving compensation by next spring. It also clears the way for the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based food and drug manufacturer that agreed to buy <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> for $ 700 million in stock and to finance the trust. The deal was conditional on approval of the trust, which was established as part of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' bankruptcy reorganization plan. `` Many of these women have been waiting for years for resolution of their claims,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, director of claims resolution for the trust. `` This is a major step forward.'' An estimated 112,800 women have filed claims with the trust and 42 percent have been paid, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said. He predicted payments under Monday's ruling could begin as early as March. Marketed in the early 1970s, the Dalkon Shield allegedly caused infections that brought infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammation and, in some cases, death. Sales of the Dalkon Shield ended in 1974 but the product was n't recalled until 1984. `` Listen to the misery caused by the Dalkon Shield and you realize that ultimate justice can never be done, even with a $ 2.6 billion payout,'' said <PERSON> Guerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney who represented the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Almost all claimants accept the fact that justice is a relative concept, the greatest good for the largest number.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer representing 18,000 women who urged the court to uphold the settlement, said it had been `` a long, long struggle for a terrible, terrible tragedy, but today's great news marks the beginning of the end. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said: `` The company is very pleased that the way finally has been cleared for consummation of its reorganization plan.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and one of the women injured by the IUD, said she was terrified the challenge to the trust set up to compensate victims would mean more long years of battles. `` I had much rather deal with the trust ... than to have direct dealings with the Robins company,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said. `` They made it very difficult for the women they injured to get compensation for their injuries.'' One dissenting vote was cast in the court's decision to reject the challenge. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to grant full review to those arguments. The women who took the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> contended the settlement wrongly barred future lawsuits against <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> officials and others, and maintained the trust fund was n't large enough. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, lead lawyer for the claimants challenging the settlement, said he would n't ask the court for a rehearing. Early out-of-court settlements with individual women averaged $ 50,000, and that had risen to $ 75,000 before the bankruptcy, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> lawyer representing some women. The higher figure would bring the settlement cost to nearly $ 5 billion, the lower to more than $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, an attorney representing the challengers, said nearly half the remaining settlements are likely to average $ 100,000. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said the trust has set the end of February as a target date to send a packet of information and a questionnaire to those with outstanding claims. American Home Products' chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, said he expected the company to complete its acquisition of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> by year's end.

 Last month's deadly earthquake ripped the economic heart out of this community by ravaging the Pacific Garden Mall, but merchants hope to salvage the Christmas shopping season by moving to tents. `` I know that if I'm not open the day after Thanksgiving, I'm bankrupt,'' mall businesswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last week Hardest hit in this quaint, seaside town 60 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was the mall, a typically eclectic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> collection of about 250 shops. They sold everything from rare books to imported coffee beans to beads as well as many necessities in turn-of-the-century buildings linked by open-air walkways along a tree-lined street. Three people were killed in the mall and several dozen of its buildings crumpled by the Oct. 17 quake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 66 people in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and did $ 7 billion in damage. On Monday, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> signed a temporary quarter-cent sales tax increase into law to raise a projected $ 800 million for earthquake relief. The hike, which takes effect Dec. 1 and lasts through 1990, adds to a statewide sales tax of 6 cents on the dollar, higher in some areas because of local levies. The tax rise was part of a package of quake relief legislation, enacted in a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, that includes $ 200 million in assistance from state reserve funds and $ 150 million in tax relief. Now that they've gotten over the shock of the quake, many <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> merchants have put aside competition and banded together. With a lot of work and a little luck, they say those hardest hit by the quake will be able to come up with enough money to lease the tents and reopen by Thanksgiving weekend. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, owner of the variety store <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>'s, is among the majority of mall merchants who have vowed to rebuild. Her store was damaged, but can be repaired. `` My guess is, it's going to be a cliffhanger every single day until -LRB- the mall itself -RRB- opens,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we can do it and it will be open and we will have a Christmas downtown.'' The council agreed to donate $ 20,000 toward rental of three huge tents, with a total floor space of 20,000 square feet. It would cost $ 314,000 to lease the tents for the year the merchants figure they'll be displaced. City officials also are trying to identify other sites that could be used as retail space, said <PERSON> Ann-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitroff </PERSON>, a city spokeswoman. Among those is a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> building and a former county jail, said Ms. <PERSON> Mitroff </PERSON>. The neighboring city of <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> has agreed to donate to the merchants a 5,000-square-foot portable building, she said. `` It is crucial the businesses get back on their feet as soon as possible,'' she said. The mall merchants collectively sell about $ 100 million worth of merchandise annually and generate about $ 1 million a year in sales tax revenue for the city, she said. As many as a fourth of the mall's businesses now face the wrecking ball, if they have n't been torn down already, Ms. <PERSON> Mitroff </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>World Trade Boomed to $2.7 Trillion in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world traded a record $ 2.7 trillion worth of goods last year, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 19 other industrial countries accounting for $ 2 trillion of it, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> reported. The overall total was an increase of 15 percent over the year before, a rise only slightly less than the 18 percent increase of 1987. Trade also increased when measured in tonnage instead of dollars, and it was increasing faster than world output as it has generally done since the 1970s. But a separate study by the fund warned of new restrictions. Inclusive figures in the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s annual `` Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook'' for 1989 were made available on Monday. They covered 161 countries including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some of its allies, which are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, were handled separately. The fund reported their trade also increased substantially, after declines or small changes over the past five years, but they accounted for only 2 percent to 3 percent of the world's commerce. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> shipped $ 323 billion worth of goods as the world's biggest exporter, which it has been since 1986 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> showed the biggest increase _ 26.7 percent _ to follow close behind with $ 320 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was third with $ 265 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained the biggest importer with $ 460 billion worth, compared with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s $ 251 billion and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s $ 189 billion. At the other extreme, the fund could not find any exports to report from <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, formerly the <LOCATION> Ellice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, with a population of only 8,000, imported $ 4 million worth. Third World countries, especially the rapidly industrializing countries of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, boosted their imports. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> bought $ 50 billion worth of foreign goods, up from $ 35 billion the year before, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> $ 51 billion instead of $ 41 billion. Both were still selling much more than they bought: <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> $ 60 billion worth and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> $ 61 billion. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s trade also increased, but at 10.5 percent it grew more slowly than in the rest of the world. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade continued strong growth _ 16 percent for exports and 15 percent for imports _ though the pace was slower than in 1987. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, exports grew by only 3.4 percent as oil sales levelled off. <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> imports increased at about the same pace as the world's: 15.3 percent. The share of the Third World as a whole in global trade increased to more than 26 percent but did not reach the levels of the earlier 1980s, when it accounted for almost a third.

<HEAD>Pickens Demands Increase in Koito Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Texas-based oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is demanding that <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in which he is the largest shareholder, pay an increased dividend for the first half of fiscal 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In a letter received by <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> demanded that it increase its dividend to 7 yen per share from the current 5 yen, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shinji </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagiwara </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> would notify <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> of its decision after a meeting of company executives on Nov. 21. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, known for his often hostile raids on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, has been battling the management of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese auto parts maker, for representation on its board. He has complained that despite a 26 percent stake in the company, he has been denied a seat on the board, although <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese car maker, has three seats with only 19 percent of the company's stock. In his letter, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the extra dividend payment would not go to the <ORGANIZATION> Azabu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> group, from which <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> bought many of his shares, <PERSON> Hagiwara </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' comments about <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON> were in response to an earlier inquiry from <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, which had been concerned that <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> would pay the extra dividend to <LOCATION> Azabu </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> believes the extra dividend demanded by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is intended to cover a 1.17 billion yen -LRB- $ 8.2 million -RRB- payment to <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON> in fines for rapid trading in its stock, said another <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Mikio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON>. `` Although Mr. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the money would n't go back to <LOCATION> Azabu </LOCATION>, they are partners, and <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON> admitted that,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has refused to comment on their partnership, he said. `` It does n't seem very wise if our dividend will indirectly help make up <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON>'s loss, does it?'' <PERSON> Tsuruta </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year found that <PERSON> Azabu </PERSON> had violated rules prohibiting rapid resale of shares and ordered it to turn over the profits gained from its sale of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> stock to the company. Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> shareholders voted to deny <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> a seat on the board. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recently that his difficulty in obtaining management rights in <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> `` is symbolic of the current trade relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> repeated his assertion that his purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> stock was not intended for speculative purposes. `` We would never do anything to damage the company,'' said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, denying that he planned a so-called greenmail campaign, in which a corporate raider buys a company's stock in hopes the company will buy the shares back at a higher price.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is among character witnesses scheduled to testify for a former <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> chairman accused of failing to stop two employees from bilking investors of thousands of dollars. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is the focus of a hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge considering the regulatory agency's allegations Although the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> does not allege that <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> himself engaged in fraud, it contends in an 18-page complaint that from at least January 1986 until May 1986, `` He did not act in good faith and-or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the fraudulent trade allocation by'' two GNP brokers. <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> `` refused to see what everyone else could see, and that was that his customers were being robbed,'' <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said in a statement Monday at the start of the seven-day hearing. But <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s case is flawed, based on `` conjecture, speculation'' and unreliable evidence <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> contends his client did not directly supervise the workers named in the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint _ <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> _ and he argued that <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> `` believed in good faith'' that their customer dealings were honest. <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> have since left the company. Their attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, said the two `` never stole a dime, did n't defraud any customers. `` We're here today because the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is on a runaway train on the wrong track,'' he said in his opening statement. <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, 53, founded GNP in 1972, headed the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 through 1985 and remained at GNP during that time. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> president under <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, is expected to make a statement on <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>'s behalf that will be read into the record at the hearing before <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Painter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has worked with <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> `` and has known him for years and he will offer his testimony as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who feels very strongly about something,'' a spokeswoman said. Others scheduled to testify for the defense include <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who said recently of <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, `` His moral character is above rproach.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> alleges that the brokers at GNP, described by <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> as a top clearing member of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, engaged in `` allocated trades'' that defrauded customers of thousands of dollars. The term refers to initiating futures contracts without the required customer account numbers, then keeping profitable trades for themselves while sticking customers with the losers. `` This is a particularly insidious fraud you have because a customer ca n't win'' and does n't know he's being bilked, Ms. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> told the judge. According to the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> was told several times between June 1985 and May 1986 that the two brokers were engaging in fraudulent activity. But he chose to ignore the warnings and did nothing to stop the brokers' actions, Ms. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. The defense maintains that the allegations of fraud stem from complaints by a disgruntled lower-rung employee who was fired from GNP and vowed to seek revenge. If found guilty, the three defendants could be permanently barred from trading and fined hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<TEXT>
 With fanfare more typical of movie or amusement park openings, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has introduced two computer systems it says will revolutionize the industry. The Houston-based firm used indoor fireworks, laser lights and booming synthesizer music Monday to announce Deskpro 486-25 _ a system touted to be the world's most powerful desktop personal computer _ and the Systempro personal computer system, said to be another industry milestone. `` Our new product offers true general purpose flexibility ... meaning it will not become obsolete,'' <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said. `` You could compare it to the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> PS-2, Model 80, which is a floor-standing unit,'' he said. `` But the Deskpro 486-25 has more expansion capability even though it sits on a desk.'' The Deskpro 486-25 uses an <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> 486 microprocessor as its heart and has three times the computing speed of its predecessor, which used a 386 chip. The Systempro, designed for network and multi-user situations, functions with a high-speed drive array storage system in a tiny area. It fits under a desk yet has the computing power of minicomputers that require racks of equipment, according to <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not just a higher horsepower engine, but a new way of doing things,'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said. `` What we're really doing today is setting the wheels in motion toward a major fundamental change in the computer industry.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> announcement came one day before rival computer maker <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled its 486-based personal computer. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s Deskpro, however, <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> will use a system similar to the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Personal System-2 line of personal computers <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> also announced that its entire personal computer line would be sold through <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s 125 locations worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has not introduced a personal computer built on the 486 chip yet, but it did come out with a card that lets users plug the 486 chip into their existing personal computers. The 486 chip is so powerful that it will allow personal computers to do certain jobs now done by engineering work stations, minicomputers and even mainframes. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> detected some minor problems with the chip last month and informed <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it would begin shipping a fixed version of the chip by the end of this month. The uncertainty about the new chip, combined with slowing sales in the American market, prompted <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> last week to announce that its fourth-quarter earnings would be below those of a year ago. That announcement triggered a 15 percent plunge in the price of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> stock. On Monday, however, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s stock jumped 75 cents a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, closing at $ 89.25. The new Deskpro 486 will be offered in three models, ranging in price from $ 13,999 to $ 20,499 with first shipments expected at <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> dealers by late December or January. The Systempro, also in three versions, ranges from $ 15,999 to $ 25,999, with shipments to begin in December. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1982, had worldwide sales last year of about $ 2 billion. The company's phenomenal growth came as it made computers that followed the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> standard. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, however, refused to follow <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> brought out its Personal System-2 line, using a new data pathway known as Micro Channel. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> and eight other personal computer makers deny <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s assertion that Micro Channel is the way of the future and say they have found a way to extend the life of the old data pathway, which they call Extended Industry Standard Architecture, or EISA

Ads Monday in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> TODAY and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, also scheduled to run in Time and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> magazines, show a red boxing glove holding a stalk of psyllium grain. `` If you think oat bran is tough, meet the new champ,'' the caption reads. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> is taking a poke at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which analysts say has used an emphasis on oat bran to increase its cereal market share to 27 percent from about 22 percent in the past year. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s share has slipped to 38.6 percent from more than 40 percent. `` Anything that changes the emphasis from oats is in <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s best interest due to their under representation in the oat bran category,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON>, a food industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered both <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> and General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> in September to document the safety of psyllium, a grain grown primarily in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency is reviewing <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s response. `` We're so confident that -LRB- psyllium -RRB- is safe that an ad like this is just natural for us,'' <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The ads are part of a $ 40-million campaign for the Heartwise cereal introduced in August.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, suffering from a continuing slowdown in the financial markets, said today that it has begun another round of layoffs. A source said the layoffs could result in as much as 2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s work force being cut in the next few weeks. The layoffs, which are expected to affect all departments in the securities firm, would be the largest on Wall Street this year. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> notified its 38,500 employees of its decision Monday in a two-paragraph internal newsletter, said company spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON>. `` The -LRB- layoff -RRB- process began yesterday,'' he said. <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON> declined to provide details on the layoffs, saying only that `` several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs in the next few weeks. However, a company source speaking on condition of anonymity said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the work force, could be cut. Shearson and other securities firms are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year as a result of the stock market's plunge of last month and the general pressure on takeover stocks. The wariness of individual investors since the October 1987 stock market crash continues to hurt the securities industry. Securities firms in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> alone have cut nearly 18,000 jobs from a peak of 163,000 two years ago. In its internal newsletter, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said the job cuts were decided after reviewing expenses and in light of an impending move by a number of its employees to a new office building. `` The decision to further reduce expenses of all kinds reflects the continued slowdown of activity and the recurring overcapacity in the financial markets,'' the newsletter said. `` The steps announced today are designed to improve overall productivity and ensure that appropriate resources are focused on the business areas with the highest potential for growth and future profitability,'' it said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 1,200 employees, and since then, it has trimmed another 300 jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of financial services giant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the second-largest securities firm in the nation, behind <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. For the first three quarters of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 106 million, or 98 cents a share, down 3 percent from earnings of $ 110 million, or $ 1.05 a share, last year Revenue rose to $ 9.6 billion from $ 7.6 billion, but expenses also climbed, to $ 9.4 billion from $ 7.5 billion.

<HEAD>Financing Dispute Could Halt Thrift Bailout, Official Warns</HEAD>

 The federal official in charge of bailing out the savings and loan industry says he'll soon have to call a halt to thrift institution rescues unless the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> swiftly resolve a politically touchy financing dispute. Legislation enacted in August provides $ 50 billion for closing or rescuing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to a new agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, who is in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, says it needs to temporarily borrow at least an additional $ 50 billion, which would be repaid as the agency sold loans and real estate acquired from failed S & amp; Ls Without the temporary funds, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> could raise cash either by the quick sale of properties once owned by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls _ a move likely to unsettle already depressed real estate markets _ or it will have to keep money-losing S & amp; Ls open, adding to the burden on taxpayers, he said. `` We are very close to being out of funds to resolve institutions without additional funds. This is a matter of weeks, not months,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said after delivering a speech Monday to the 97th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. However, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, president of the administration board that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, contradicted <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>. He told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking panel that the initial $ 50 billion should last through next year. The bailout agency has handled 33 thrift failures so far, has another 260 institutions under its control and expects to take over 200 to 300 more in coming months. But it is caught in a dispute between the administration, which wants the additional borrowing kept out of the federal budget deficit, and congressional Democrats, who would swell the deficit by tens of billions of dollars, increasing pressure on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to agree to a tax increase. `` That's obviously a hot political question. ... We're kind of caught in the middle,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is one of the key legislators pressing for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L borrowing to be `` on budget,'' told 3,600 convention delegates that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration are acting irresponsibly in avoiding consideration of a tax increase `` We must stop pretending that taxes must not be part of the debate and start talking about the fairest and most efficient way to raise revenue,'' he said. `` Everything has to be on the table, all taxes and all spending.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> questioned whether two provisions of the S & amp; L law were hurting the industry's long-run prospects. One forces S & amp; Ls starting July 1991 to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing, up from 60 percent currently. The other imposes higher deposit insurance premiums on thrifts compared with commercial banks. He said thrifts must be able to diversify to avoid becoming overly dependent on any one line of business. He said there must be a `` level playing field'' on deposit insurance premiums. In another development, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry losses in the July-September quarter were at least $ 2.5 billion _ a large amount, but still the best showing since the industry reported $ 1.8 billion in red ink in the third quarter of last year. That brings losses for the first nine months of 1989 to $ 9.7 billion, about the same pace as last year's record $ 13.4 billion loss. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> also said asset levels and deposit flows in September show that S & amp; Ls are striving to meet tough new capital standards, announced Monday and effective Dec. 7, by shrinking their portfolios rather than by raising new capital. In September, thrifts sold $ 15 billion in assets, up from a record $ 13.4 billion in August. Deposit outflows totaled about $ 9 billion, up from $ 5.1 billion in August and close to the record $ 10.8 billion in January, he said. The standards, required by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation enacted three months ago, are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to absorb losses before an institution fails and federal deposit insurance kicks in. The thrift office estimated that 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, holding about 45 percent of the industry's $ 1.3 trillion in assets, fall nearly $ 20 billion short of the new capital standard.

 Cash-starved <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has suspended all regular passenger flights, jeopardizing some 1,800 jobs and angering employees who had stuck with the airline during two bankruptcy proceedings. `` These people that bought <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, they need to be put on trial by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees and taken out for a public flogging,'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a laid-off customer service agent, said when he heard the news in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. In a statement issued at midnight Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> said the action was taken to preserve assets while a reorganization plan is developed and a sale of the airline is considered. There were no immediate reports of passengers being stranded by the suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s 46 daily passenger flights. In <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarter offices and ticket counters were empty and no passengers were seen. `` I think the impact is not going to be that severe in that many people have booked on other airlines. I think the word was out and people were booking elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>, assistant general manager at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had operated 20 daily flights. About 30 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> planes were parked at the airport this morning, <ORGANIZATION> Napoli </ORGANIZATION> said. The company advised ticketholders to check if other airlines would honor the tickets. People who bought tickets with a credit card were told to consult with the card company, and those who purchased tickets with cash or a check after Sept. 28 were given a toll-free number to call for a refund. The suspension of flights came as a surprise to many of the employees who remained with the airline after it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy code Sept. 28 for the second time. `` We're all in shock,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> pilot based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` We were hoping that someone would buy <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and want to run it, but maybe there was nothing left to buy. It's just a case of complete mismanagement.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> did n't address the possibility of layoffs other than to say employees would be notified of their status, a prospect that left union officials frustrated. `` What a mess,'' said V.O. <PERSON> Delle-Femine </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, upon hearing the news in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Ever since the bankruptcy, upper management has given no response, no answer to the employees of the company,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gladstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant who was called back to work Nov. 1. <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION>, an investor group formed by <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, bought <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> in June for about $ 100 million and became the airline's third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy reorganization. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had 4,800 employees when it filed for bankruptcy again in September. At the time, it said it was cutting the number of cities served from 36 to 11: <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The airline had a workforce of about 1,800 before the suspension of service. Under a court-administered reorganization plan, the company had put 46 of its 256 pre-Sept. 28 flights back in the air by Friday, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> But the effort was doomed by a cash shortage, she said. `` We did n't come up with any other alternative financing and options like that. There just was n't any more cash,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The last flights were arriving at about the time of the announcement and the planes would remain at their destinations indefinitely, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will try to expand its charter service while studying its options, including sale of the company, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer. The airline lost $ 31.8 million during the first six months of this year on sales of $ 293 million. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 100 mostly administrative employees.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed in quiet trading this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns papers in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, today blamed a 12 percent drop in third-quarter income on tax rate adjustments.

 Stock prices rebounded slightly after waffling in early trading today amid ongoing concern about corporate profitability and interest rates, analysts said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.72 points to 2,586.89 at noon EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indictor was up 1.23 points after a weak opening. Declining issues narrowly edged out advancers on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 697 issues down, 596 up and 544 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 85.94 million shares. The market opened weak after Monday's steep drop, then seesawed through the morning session. Wall Street observers said the market bounced back from earlier lows on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be moving to ease credit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on Monday as market players reacted to unexpectedly weak third-quarter earnings reports. Analysts said investors are concerned about the outlook for fourth-quarter corporate profits. `` The basic problem is profitability. If we did that poorly in the third period what's going to happen in the fourth?'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said market participants also were concerned about interest rates after last week's better-than-expected unemployment report rekindled worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not ease credit anytime soon Investors hope for a decline in short-term interest rates to revive corporate profitability, analysts said.

 Stocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> rose Tuesday in slow trading. Technical factors and less fear of an imminent hike in British interest rates helped prices. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up 8.6 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,178.2, its session high. The key index advanced throughout the session after posting its low in early trading.

<HEAD>EC Members Disagree On Telecommunications Deregulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communications ministers of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries disagreed Tuesday on a proposed plan to liberalize telecommunications services. The ministers could not decide what powers would be reserved for national communications authorities after the proposal would take effect at the end of 1992. But they agreed to continue working through a committee of experts, and scheduled a meeting for Dec. 7 at which they hope to reach a compromise. The proposal, made by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, would enable private companies to offer many `` value-added'' telecommunications services that are currently reserved for public telephone monopolies in some countries. That proposal is accompanied by another Commission initiative, known as the `` open network provision,'' which would require public telecommunications networks, now in the hands of national monopolies in most EC countries, to be opened to private companies for a reasonable fee. The <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal on services ran into objections from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which wants to reserve for national authorities the right to decide what services and users would have access to the national telecommunications grid, according to <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> sources. Other countries, such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, argued that reserving such powers for national authorities would amount to a re-regulation of their own, more liberalized markets for telecommunications services. The telecommunications proposals are part of the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s push to create a single internal market for goods and services by the end of 1992.

 The nation's former chief savings and loan regulator testified today that four senators asked him in a closed-door meeting in 1987 to drop a proposed regulation that would have curtailed risky investments by <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the request was made by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., at an April 2, 1987, meeting in <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> `` Sen. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> ... said he and the other senators were there on behalf of their friend at Lincoln Savings ...,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` He said that if I withdraw the regulation ... they would get their friend to make more home loans.'' `` It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' he testified. `` It was a quid pro quo. I told Sen. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> I would not withdraw the regulation.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> senator and three other senators have consistently taken issue with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s description of the meeting `` There were five people in that room _ <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and the four senators,'' he said in a telephone interview, `` and all four senators have said on the record that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is totally and completely inaccurate.'' <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said a description of the meeting provided subsequently by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> supports the senators' accounts of what had transpired there. <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s account of the meeting was based on a briefing he had been given by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. The four senators have acknowledged that they received more than $ 1.1 million in political contributions raised by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. The regulation, which was put into effect last summer only as part of a $ 157 billion taxpayer bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry, would have curtailed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> from continuing to invest federallly insured deposits in risky real estate ventures. As the result of those investments which later turned sour, the government last April sezied control of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> at an estimated cost of up to $ 2 billion to taxpayers for repaying savers whose federally insured deposits were lost. `` Sens. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> had evidently bought off on the scheme when they met with me,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> testified. `` The receipt of very substantial gifts from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his associates had long since put them in the right frame of mind to ... embrace the notion that there was somehow a vendetta against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'' by regulators. `` When enough money flows, it's apparently easier to be gullible,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. He recalled that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also had hired <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and then a private economist, to press his case that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s investments were sound and argue against the need for the regulation. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also outlined how former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> orchestrated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointment of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Henkel </PERSON>, a business associate of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, to the bank board `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> had finally achieved his wish,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> had gotten this far because of his political influence _ translate that as money _ all the way to and through the White House ... And with friends like <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, what was to stop him?'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also had been scheduled to testify today, but his new attorney on Monday asked that his appearance be postponed for two weeks. Today's hearing was the fourth held by the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on why <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was allowed to keep operating for two years after federal examiners said it was posing a threat to the government's deposit insurance funds Bank board officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> recommended on May 1, 1987, that the government seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> because of its mounting losses. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, whose term expired two months later, passed the problem on to his successor, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, now director of the new Office of Thrift Supervision in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was seized by the bank board in April, nearly two years after federal examiners first recommended taking it over. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to clean up the thrift mess, filed a $ 1.1 billion suit in September against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his relatives alleging fraud and racketeering. Wall has acknowledged he met with <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> after taking office and said he subsequently rejected the recommendation of the board's regional office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to take <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> over He has defended the action, saying the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> officials had enough information to restrict some of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s activities but not enough to warrant taking it over without first going through a lengthy court battle. Instead, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> ordered that supervision of the troubled thrift be transferred to the board's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters while a second audit was conducted by field examiners from other parts of the country. Members of the second team testified last week their audit was hampered by directions from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to ignore the previous audits and the high salaries that were paid to <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his relatives.

<HEAD>Amended Suit Accuses Northrop of $20 Billion Fraud on B-2 Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 stealth bomber program cheated the government out of more than $ 20 billion, according to a revised lawsuit filed by one current and five former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees. The lawsuit exposes `` one of the most massive frauds ever perpetrated in the defense procurement industry,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON>, attorney for those who filed the suit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mariana </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfaelzer </PERSON> on Monday unsealed the 65-page suit, which raises the estimate of the alleged fraud from between $ 400 million and $ 1 billion as was estimated in the initial suit filed in February 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> `` was doing more than simply mischarging or supplying false parts or falsifying tests,'' said <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON>. The suit says <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> `` lacked the current historical pricing data and technical knowhow to develop and build'' the bat-shaped aircraft, which is designed to elude radar and which made its first flight last summer. <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> has filed several other suits on behalf of current or former employees against the aerospace company, whose stock price has sagged following repeated allegations of wrongdoing and fears that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may cancel the B-2 bomber as too expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said the company had not had time to study the amended lawsuit. But he said allegations in the original complaint had never been substantiated, noting that the government has not intervened in the case, as it is allowed to do in such `` whistleblower'' suits. `` The last time he -LRB- <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> -RRB- made an attack on the B-2 program, the government investigated for eight months and found there was no basis for intervention,'' <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> declined to say if government lawyers were reconsidering whether to intervene in light of the new allegations. Separately Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Kresa </PERSON> tried to reassure a group of financial analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that production of the B-2 was going ahead and that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> remains on firm ground. <PERSON> Kresa </PERSON> noted that a Senate-House conference committee had authorized production of two B-2s in 1990 and continued funding for five more in 1991. The whistleblower suit enables the plaintiffs to share in treble damages with the government if it succeeds. The suit alleges <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> originally misrepresented its ability to undertake the B-2 bomber project in 1980 and subsequently misrepresented its progress at each level of development of the plane. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> originally promised to build 132 B-2s by 1993 for about $ 40 billion, but the government now estimates it will cost $ 70 million if it is completed. `` Northrop began to manipulate the information it was contractually and statutorily obligated to truthfully report ... in order both to hide technical problems and to continue receiving payments from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the suit said. New plaintiffs joining the suit are <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottaviano </PERSON>, former manager of the electronic data processing audit department for the B-2 program, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Croswell </PERSON>, former manager of manufacturing technology. The other plaintiffs are <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Truong </PERSON>, a former process integration manager for the program; engineer <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON>; strategic analyst <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Schielke </PERSON>, a former senior audit manager. <PERSON> Schielke </PERSON>, the only current <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employee, has since been reassigned as an accountant for the company's van pool program.

 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has settled a two-year dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> over the use of safety claims in advertisements for its automatic shut-off irons. Although the ads were pulled shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> raised objections to their use in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> until Monday had refused to accept <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines restricting the use of private laboratory claims in product advertisements. The conflict revolved around the company's use of an endorsement from the Michigan-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had given the iron its `` exclusive'' certification of safety after it was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> to conduct tests on its product. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has questioned the use of such claims in ads because it believes they give consumers the mistaken impression that the endorsement is sanctioned by an official agency. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> began using the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement in 1987, but pulled the advertisement that year after the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> raised questions about the council's qualifications and testing procedures, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geltzer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company One of the ads in the campaign said: `` All irons should come with this seal.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier to Challenge Compensation Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance companies should find it easier to sue in federal court to challenge compensation awards to injured workers following a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision Tuesday. The justices, by an 8-1 vote, allowed an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> insurance company to go to federal court to challenge a worker compensation award to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man. The court said insurers may sue in federal court even though the employer they insure is based in the same state as the injured worker _ as long as the insurance company is from another state than the opposing side. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said federal law bars such federal lawsuits when insurance companies are sued. But the law clearly does not apply when the insurance companies are doing the suing, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The distinction may seem incongruous, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` We can not doubt that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meant what it said.'' The case stems from a compensation claim awarded <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> for an injury he suffered on April 4, 1986, while working for <ORGANIZATION> Whitmire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lamar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s job, his injuries or the size of the compensation award. <ORGANIZATION> Northbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, insures <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> for worker compensation claims. The insurance firm went to federal court in 1987 to challenge the award to <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> made by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Industrial Accident Board. A federal judge threw out the insurer's suit and the ruling was upheld by the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. At issue was a doctrine called `` diversity jurisdiction'' which gives federal courts authority to rule on civil disputes when the opposing sides are from different states. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in a lone dissent, said worker compensation is primarily a matter of local interest with which federal courts `` have only minimal contact.'' The case is <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 88-995.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart's Quarterly Profit Climbs 29 Percent; Limited's Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The large discount chain <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said its third-quarter profit climbed 29 percent, boosted by strong sales growth. Specialty apparel retailer <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 21 percent gain in its third-quarter income on a 10 percent increase in sales. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, the country's third largest retailer, announced its after-tax earnings rose to $ 232.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 31 from $ 180.9 million, or 32 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter. Sales at the stores <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> operates in 27 states totaled $ 6.28 billion in the third quarter, up from $ 4.99 billion a year earlier. At the end of the quarter, the <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, Ark.-based retailer had 1,347 <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores, 118 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot Discount Drug stores and three Hypermart <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> units. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> ranks third in terms of sales after industry leader <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter performance reflects attention to customer service, disciplined inventory management and merchandising `` We expect the fourth quarter to be highly competitive but believe our inventory levels, our associates' involvement and continued efforts at exceeding our customers' expectations will enable us to meet our goals and objectives,'' Glass said in a news release. For the first nine months of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s financial year, income rose 26 percent to $ 650.04 million, or $ 1.15 a share, from $ 514.04 million, or 91 cents a share, through three quarters of 1988. Nine-month sales amounted to $ 17.7 billion, up 25 percent from $ 14.12 billion during the comparable portion of 1988. Separately, Limited said its net income rose to $ 84.9 million, or 47 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 28 frm $ 70.4 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.01 billion. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxner </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said Limited pursued a cautious strategy during the autumn, keeping inventories below last year's level, on a square foot basis. `` My view was that the general economy was softening and lacked strong consumer demand,'' <PERSON> Waxner </PERSON> said. `` I believe our third quarter earnings are a reflection of that conservative inventory position.'' He said business in the third quarter `` was focused conservatively on the quality of sales and profitability.'' <PERSON> Waxner </PERSON> expressed a more upbeat attitude toward the fourth quarter, which is a crucial time for retailers. `` The current success of our merchandising effort and the acceptance of our fashion direction gives us more optimism as we enter the fourth quarter,'' <PERSON> Waxner </PERSON> said. Retailers pick up about a third of their annual revenues and a half or more of their yearly profits in the two-month peak holiday shopping season. For the first nine months of this year, Limited's earnings rose 55 percent to $ 193.8 million, or $ 1.07 a share, from $ 124.99 million, or 69 cents a share, the prior year. Nine-month sales rose 13 percent to $ 3.07 billion from $ 2.71 billion. Limited is one of the country's leading specialty apparel chains with 3,120 stores.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Rebound Amid Interest Rate Optimism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices rallied from a weak opening amid renewed investor optimism that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might move to lower interest rates. Wall Street analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s addition of reserves to the banking system through customer repurchase agreements sparked a rise in the bond market that helped boost stock prices. Investors interpreted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> activity as an indication that the next move might involve a cut in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges its member banks, traders said. The yield on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell sharply after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move. The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans, also declined. Stock prices opened weak then waffled through the morning session following the previous day's losses. `` It appears that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might be doing a little easing and that's why the market has rallied,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, chief market analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on what analysts said was a response to unexpectedly weak third-quarter earnings reports The bleak outlook for fourth-quarter corporate profits and interest rates worries had also helped depress prices, analysts said. Last week's better-than-expected unemployment report rekindled worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not ease credit anytime soon. Investors hope for a decline in short-term interest rates to revive corporate profitability, analysts said. Analysts also attributed the day's gains to bargain hunting and technical factors after Monday's steep declines. `` We were oversold after yesterday,'' said said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> continued laying off employees Tuesday in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its work force by year's end and experts predicted other securities firms would make similar reductions in coming months due to a continued slowdown in the financial markets. `` It's not a problem just for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>; everybody has it,'' said <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think we'll be seeing several cutbacks but in smaller numbers ... to avoid a lot of media attention.'' Shearson and other Wall Street firms, particularly retail brokerages catering to individual investors, have been under increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of rising operating expenses. Most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year due to the stock market's October plunge and the general pressure on takeover stocks, which had been the driving force behind the market's earlier advances. The lingering wariness of individual investors since the October 1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry. `` I would n't sit here and wait for his -LRB- individual investor's -RRB- imminent return in size,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroeder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` With business slow and expenses high something's got to give.'' Total employment by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-member brokerages has fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262,173 employees in September 1987 to 229,455 by mid-1989. The firms had added about 120,000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash. The decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the growth of revenue. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group, said overall revenue grew from $ 50 billion in 1986 to $ 52 billion last year. Although revenue rose to $ 60 billion by mid-1989, it was expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> _ second only to <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in terms of the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail brokerage offices _ began laying off some of its 38,500 employees Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph newsletter that more across-the-board cuts were planned, said company spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> cited, among other things, the slowdown of market activity, which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds that generates commissions and trading profits. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of financial services giant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, earned $ 106 million, or 98 cents a share, during the first three months of this year. That was off 3 percent from earnings of $ 110 million, or $ 1.05 a share, last year. <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON> declined to provide details on <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s layoffs and said only that `` several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs in the next few weeks. But a company source speaking on condition of anonymity said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the total work force, could be cut. That would be the largest staff reduction on Wall Street this year. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then it has trimmed another 300 jobs. Other Wall Street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this past year. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> laid off more than 100 employees in its taxable fixed-income sales division. The firm had announced earlier this year that it was selling its entire retail brokerage division of 2,300 workers. Over the past three years it has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10,000. Among the others, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last spring laid off 200 employees, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has let go dozens of bond traders and <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 120 employees, largely in its municipal bond and stock departments. Long said that in addition to gradual cuts, many firms `` are paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring.''

<HEAD>Lenient Sentences Renew Debate on RICO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lenient sentences in the Princeton-Newport racketeering case renewed debate Tuesday on whether the racketeering statute, originally designed to fight organized crime, should be used in white-collar cases. Opponents of the Racketeer and Influenced Organization Act said the three - and six-month sentences given Monday indicate that the law, which carries a maximum term of 20 years, was used inappropriately in the Princeton-Newport case Others said the short sentences were another example of the disparate treatment between white-collar defendants and defendants in other crimes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sentenced to prison five former officials of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> trader who were convicted July 31 in the first racketeering trial of securities professionals. The case drew wide criticism because of the use of the racketeering law, which allows prosecutors to freeze a defendant's assets before trial The statute also allows forfeiture of ill-gotten gains upon conviction. Several defense lawyers who were interviewed Tuesday also said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s sentences were a reflection of recent revisions in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rules governing the use of the racketeering law. The changes included restricting the use of tax violations, on which the Princeton-Newport case was based, in bringing racketeering charges. `` I think the sentences reflect that these kinds of cases are not appropriate for RICO and it was wrong to use the statute in the first place,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the brother of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, in their racketeering and fraud case. Much of the same evidence from the Princeton-Newport case is expected to be introduced at the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' trial, scheduled for March 1990 The Princeton-Newport case involved a series of prearranged stock transactions between 1984 and 1986. The government alleged that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to generate phony tax losses. Princeton-Newport, based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, went out of business after the indictment was brought in August 1988. Defense lawyers said at the time that the charges alone destroyed the firm. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said that the financial repercussions of RICO, including the potential loss of a business, place unfair pressure on white-collar defendants to try to settle the charges through a plea bargain. `` It's been used by certain prosecutors in the last few years as a blackjack to threaten people involved in perfectly normal kinds of disputes with the extreme racketeering penalties that the statue provided even before trial,'' he said. `` So you had people who feared the unknown of an extreme penalty pleading guilty to avoid it even though in their own minds they had n't done anything wrong.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s sentences `` an outrage.'' `` I believe that his handling of this case will become a classic example in law books of disparate treatment between white-collar defendants and street crime defendants,'' said <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who also serves as vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said the new policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were simply an effort to impose high-level control over the types of cases brought under RICO, something he said government officials had been doing all along. `` The key point is that it is true that RICO was written primarily with organized crime in mind,'' he said. `` However, the legislative record is clear that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also intended to strike at long-term systemic white-collar crime.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmid </PERSON>, a securities law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, played down the importance of the Princeton-Newport sentences. `` The sentences obviously reflects some sense of this group suffering a great deal,'' <PERSON> Goldschmid </PERSON> said. `` If I were on Wall Street, given the special circumstances here, I would n't take great comfort in the prospect that this, the relatively lenient sentences, will occur too often in the future.''

<HEAD>Drexel Unveils New Junk-Bond Index, Says Market Is `Cyclical'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the prime booster of the junk bond market, unveiled a new index Tuesday to track the performance of these high-yield securities and said improvement in this troubled market may be near. `` About the time that everyone declares the high-yield market is dead it will rebound,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. `` This is a cyclical business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said its new high-yield index will track the performance of about 700 junk bond issues, or about two-thirds of the $ 200 billion in outstanding junk bonds. It replaces a narrower junk bond index that monitored 110 issues. The new index, which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said is the result of months of research, should provide a much broader and clearer picture of the prices of junk-bond issues, which often are difficult to track due to the thin trading in this market. Unlike high-yield indexes compiled by some other investment houses, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s index will track actual price changes of all the bonds it follows. The prices will be provided by traders who deal in these issues. The so-called matrix indexes compiled by some other Wall Street companies use the prices of a few benchmark bonds to calculate the overall market's performance. The monthly <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> index tracks total return on junk bonds, which includes any price changes plus interest payments. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said the growth of the junk bond market in recent years prompted it to devise the new index, which includes the newer variations in high-yield bonds, such as deferred-interest bonds, interest-reset bonds and zero coupon bonds. High-yield bonds are those rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. They typically are issued by small companies or those lacking a credit history. They also are used to raise money for leveraged buyouts, in which a group buying a company pledges as collateral the company's assets. Since they carry a higher risk of default than investment-grade bonds, junk bonds yield more interest. While saying reports of the death of the junk bond market are premature, <PERSON> Sorte </PERSON> told reporters the leveraged buyout business that fueled the issuance of high-yield debt should remain slow for the foreseeable future. The LBO market was sent in a tailspin when several large, highly publicized deals began to come apart earlier this year. Some junk-bond issuers, such as Canadian retailer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s Resorts International, said they would have trouble paying interest on their junk bonds, raising questions about the viability of the high-yield market. <PERSON> Sorte </PERSON> said two factors have crimped the LBO business: The cost of raising funds has risen, due to the junk bond troubles, and investors in these deals are demanding that they involve less debt.

 The dollar weakened Tuesday against all major currencies, reflecting concern that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are heading lower. Gold prices, meanwhile, rose sharply here and abroad.

 Oil futures prices finished mixed Tuesday in quiet trading. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed down 8 cents at $ 20.02 a 42-gallon barrel. The January contract ended at $ 19.79 a barrel, unchanged from Monday. Refined products traded on the exchange finished mixed. Analysts said the market focused on buying heating oil contracts and selling gasoline futures. No. 2 heating oil for December delivery gained 0.17 cent to 59.83 cents a gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline for December dropped 0.05 cent to 52.41 cents a gallon. Contracts for later delivery were higher for both markets. The price changes marked a flip-flop from Monday, when heating oil fell and gasoline rose. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, energy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said heating oil has gained consistently against gasoline in the last months but reversed directions on Monday because of selling in heating oil to gain profits.

 The stock market rallied Tuesday amid renewed investor optimism that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might move to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished 14.96 points higher at 2,597.13 after a sharp loss on Monday. Wall Street observers said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s addition of reserves to the banking system through customer repurchase agreements sparked a rise in the bond market that helped boost stock prices. Investors interpreted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action as evidence that the next move could be an easing of the discount rate, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, equities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges its member banks. `` Investors were in the mood to listen to favorable rumors and seized on this as a rationalization to nibble a bit,'' said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, adding that such an interest rate move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely. Investors hope for a decline in short-term interest rates to revive sagging corporate profitability in the fourth quarter, analysts said. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 47.34 points on what analysts said was a response to unexpectedly weak third-quarter earnings reports and a bleak near-term outlook. The yield on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell sharply after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move, reflecting bond investors' optimism about a rate cut. The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans, also declined. `` We finally got the turn that we needed to stimulate the stock market,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Stock prices opened weak then seesawed through the morning session following the previous day's losses Analysts also attributed Tuesday's gains to bargain hunting and technical factors after Monday's steep declines. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 9 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 813 issues up, 662 down and 496 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 163.00 million shares, up from 135.48 million on Monday. Analysts said that program trading, a computerized form of buying and selling large blocks of stocks, has remained a factor in price movements but did not cause wide price swings in the last two sessions. `` Program trading is there, but it's not gotten as volatile, as whippy, as before,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, chief market analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 191.458 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, stock markets overall rose by $ 14.420 billion, or 0.44 percent, in value from Monday.

<HEAD>Sugar Prices Soar As Demand Outstrips Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices climbed sharply Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as demand continues to outstrip supplies on the world market On other markets, copper and precious metals futures surged, pork and livestock futures gained, energy futures were mostly higher and grains and soybeans were mixed. Sugar futures settled .22 cent to .50 cent higher with the contract for delivery in January at 14.40 cents a pound. The market continued to show concern over the availability of Brazilian sugar despite the announcement Tuesday by government officials that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will honor 492,000 metric tons of export contracts. Adding to the surge in prices was the sale of a large block of sugar to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the sale to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a sugar exporting country, was to help that country fulfill supply contracts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The supply situation tightened up substantially overnight,'' <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON> said, adding that market is living on a hand-to-mouth basis. `` The market is set,'' he said. `` Whenever someone buys a large amount of sugar, the market will go higher, then drift until the next purchase, when the market will go up again.'' Reports that miners at <ORGANIZATION> Codelco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> operations will vote to strike this week sent copper prices up sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Analyst <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> noted that the market was ready for a price surge because of the steep decline in copper prices in recent weeks. The falloff was due to the settlement of strike last month in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Codelco </ORGANIZATION> mine are due to a restructuring of management, which also is limiting the influence of the unions, <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said. December copper rallied to a session high of $ 1.1290 a pound before profit taking pushed back to a close of $ 1.1115 for a gain of 1.55 cents. Precious metals prices climbed on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar slumped. Gold settled $ 4.60 to $ 4.70 higher with November at $ 386.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to 2.9 cents an ounce higher with November at $ 5.265 a troy ounce. Frozen pork bellies were up the daily trading limit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with gains fueled by orders from commission houses and short covering. The buying was supported by projections of firm fresh belly prices. The surge in pork bellies prices spilled over to live hog futures, which were also helped by strong cash prices at terminal markets. Steady to higher prices at feed cattle sales help lift livestock futures prices. Live cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent higher with December at 74.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent higher with November at 83.05 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent to .73 cent higher with December at 48.32 a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.53 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 61.55 cents a pound. Oil futures prices finished mixed in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as the market focused on buying heating oil contracts and selling gasoline futures. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 8 cents lower with December at $ 20.02 a barrel; heating oil was .17 to .55 cents higher with December at 59.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with December at 52.41 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in modest trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled -RCB- cent lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.05 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were \ cent to -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were \ cent lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.64 \ a

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted 7-6 Tuesday to impose strict new controls on auto exhaust pollution, but opponents and supporters agreed the issue will be fought over again. The provision, similar in its initial stages to one approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, was passed over the objections of the auto industry and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, who contended consumers would pay an extra $ 500 a car as a result. An initial set of reductions would begin with 1993 models, making all cars meet standards required in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, currently more stringent than those in force elsewhere. By 2003, an additional 50 percent cut in emissions of major pollutants would be required. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the subcommittee, disputed the $ 500 figure, equating the cost of pollution reductions in the next century to the purchase of `` a nice new hubcap. The ranking Republican, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said the panel should have deferred action until it studied his plan to let automakers choose how to reduce harmful emissions early in the 21st Century. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, backed by the administration, said the auto companies should be able to choose between cutting tailpipe emissions or building cars that could run on fuels that burn cleaner than gasoline. `` We ought to look at oil companies'' to produce cleaner fuels, <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said. `` Why should they be let off the hook in doing something on clean air?'' <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, chief sponsor of the subcommittee legislation, said he could support a clean fuels amendment, but only in addition to the second round of tailpipe reductions. He said a committee hearing on the issue would be held Nov. 20, but a fast-track committee schedule would force the next arguments onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The 7-6 vote Tuesday was a straight party-line split that reflected the Democratic control of the subcommittee. This would likely dissolve on the floor, where the line would be drawn between supporters and opponents of the auto industry. Building cars to run on other fuels is a major feature of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air proposals, which did not propose new exhaust pollution reductions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill's pollution reduction requirements for non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would be tougher than those in the major clean air legislation approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in that they would start taking effect a year earlier. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would go beyond the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> standards to requirements resembling the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provisions only if a study found such a course feasible, necessary and cost-effective. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure contains no such `` second look.'' The House provisions were the product of a major agreement designed to remain that chamber's position at least through conference committee negotiations expected next year. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman and a backer of environmental groups and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., committee chairman and a friend of the auto industry, negotiated the pact to end a decade of feuding that stalled progress on clean air <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for air programs, said `` it makes a lot of sense'' to let automakers choose the method of reducing motor vehicle pollution in the next century He said <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s clean fuels alternative _ which was not formally introduced _ would become effective starting in 1995, eight years sooner than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill's second round of reductions. He argued that automakers could save consumers $ 7 billion by choosing clean-burning fuels over additional tailpipe reductions.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, awaiting final word on whether the merger of its Lucky and <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> markets violates antitrust law, said Tuesday it had worked out a deal to sell 13 of its 36 <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> stores in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and merge the others with Lucky operations. American and the state attorney general's office also agreed that if the attorney general wins the antitrust case, any additional divestitures by American in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be limited to $ 1 million a week in sales. That could amount to as many as seven or eight more stores, depending on how much business they do, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Most of the 550 Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarkets are in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and the divestiture of the 13 stores, combined with earlier divestitures, essentially settles the anti-trust case in the northern part of the state, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` Clearly the bulk of the problem was in the south,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. He said that in the <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> market area in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> also agreed to open no new stores for three years. They already have two stores there now, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. State Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> contends that the $ 2.5 billion merger would cost shoppers $ 400 million a year, and has taken his suit seeking to block it to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has yet to rule on the case. In the meantime, a preliminary injunction issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> prevents American from going ahead with the merger. American Stores, in a release from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said it had worked out a deal with <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> to allow the sale of 13 stores in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> counties to other supermarket operators. The remaining stores north of <LOCATION> Kern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties will be integrated into Lucky operations.

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is about to begin testing peel-and-stick postage stamps in 15 cities, but buyers will have to pay extra for the convenience. Eighteen of the 25-cent stamps will be sold in a sheet that folds into a booklet. The price will be $ 5, 50 cents more than the face value of the stamps. `` It is expected to appeal to consumers willing to pay extra for a deluxe product,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the test marketing program. The stamp, which displays artwork of an eagle and shield, will go on sale for the first time Friday at a stamp show in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Va. The 30-day test period will follow, with sales in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Collectors may order the stamps from the agency's Philatelic Sales Division, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, 20265-9997. It will be the second self-adhesive stamp offered by the postal service. A self-sticking Christmas stamp was issued in 1974, but problems were encountered with the glue. Postal officials say they believe they have solved those problems. `` Market research indicated that consumers place a high value on the new features we are offering and feel it is appropriate to charge extra for them,'' said Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>. `` By selling the new product in 15 major cities and soliciting consumer responses, we will be able to make a sound decision about future production for national distribution,'' he said. Postal officials say the new stamps will not become stuck together in humid weather, and the glue will act slowly enough to allow them to be repositioned on envelopes. In addition, the adhesive is water soluble, so that after use the stamps may be soaked off envelopes by collectors.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys in the Hunt bankruptcy reorganization case say they're not sure they can meet a federal bankruptcy judge's order that a settlement be reached or the assets will be liquidated Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> on Monday cited the continuing drain on the estate of ex-billionaire <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, in announcing he would convert the case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Nov. 20. The ruling gives major creditors just two weeks to work out a compromise that they have failed to reach since the oilman and son of the late H.L. Hunt filed for bankruptcy in September 1988. `` We were happy the judge gave us two weeks to fix it. He could have just converted it today,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Gardere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s attorney. Other attorneys were n't so optimistic, saying privately that they doubted the gap between two major creditors in the case could be bridged in such a short time. If it is converted to Chapter 7, the remaining assets of <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s once vast estate would be sold off rapidly, with most of the proceeds going to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the largest creditor in the case with a claim of $ 300 million in back taxes The judge also said the continued litigation facing the estate was drying up what few proceeds remained. `` The court can not continue to sit by idly while this continues,'' Judge <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> said. Under bankruptcy procedures, creditors and the debtor file reorganization plans and try to reach a consensus on repayment of debt. Plans have been filed by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and three major creditors. But the judge said Monday that none of the reorganization plans before him were confirmable. The ruling has no impact on <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who also sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 last year. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who was on hand with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, to hear the decision, has assets currently valued at $ 125 million to satisfy debts of nearly $ 900 million, bankruptcy court filings show. A Chapter 7 liquidation of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s estate would reap $ 60 million to $ 70 million, or roughly half the $ 125 million that would be divided among creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Hundreds of smaller creditors would get nothing if the estate is liquidated under Chapter 7, attorneys involved in the case say. `` I am quite disappointed. I think this is a disaster for the unsecured creditors,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, attorney for the bankruptcy trustee in the <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> case. `` The stuff in this estate is incredibly illiquid,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a major creditor in the case. `` It just depends on whether they have to sell it all tomorrow.'' The ruling was prompted by the ongoing dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, a mining concern owned by the Peruvian government, and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank that has a $ 36 million claim in the case. Manufacturers Hanover says its claim should have priority over a $ 132 million judgment Minpeco is trying to collect from the two Hunt brothers. The judgment, which has swelled to more than $ 250 million with interest and attorneys fees, stems from the Hunt's silver conspiracy case.

<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with House approving bill to create
a congressional panel to investigate Eastern strike; No pickup; ADDS byline;

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave final congressional approval Tuesday to legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate the 8-month-old strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a measure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has threatened to veto. The bill, approved on a voice vote, is a watered-down version of organized labor's initial attempt to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to demand that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervene in the strike, something the president refused to do when the walkout began March 4. The idea for a four-member congressional panel was substituted for the initial bill demanding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> use his power to halt the strike and name an emergency board to settle the dispute. In refusing to intervene in March, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the dispute should be settled by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and management and that emergency situations justifying intervention did not exist. A month ago, the administration, in a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, threatened to veto the legislation creating the commission, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that position had not changed. Labor urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> now joins the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in an action long overdue,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law. For the president to do otherwise would strip the administration of any pretense of fairness in this dispute.'' In a separate development, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> again asked a federal bankruptcy court to extend its exclusive right to submit a proposed reorganization plan and its deadline for detailing how that plan would work. Eastern filed a motion Monday asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to extend the exclusivity period for its reorganization plan by 60 days to Jan. 12. During that period, other parties to the case can not file reorganization proposals for Eastern under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy code. The Miami-based airline also requested a 30-day extension, to Dec. 13, of the deadline for filing its disclosure statement, which is designed to provide details of how it intends to emerge from bankruptcy. Eastern, which was struck by its pilots, Machinists and flight attendants on March 4 in an ongoing walkout, has hired replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has not yet set a date for considering <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s requests, airline spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Tuesday from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> He said the requests were motivated by the size and complexity of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceeding. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> previously had granted Eastern two extensions of its exclusivity period and one deferred deadline for filing the disclosure statement. Under the bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a Democrat and a Republican from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and one each from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be appointed by their respective party leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the commission, which would make recommendations on how to settle the strike and on maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry. The panel also would make recommendations on how to protect employee collective bargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving airlines. The report would be due 45 days after enactment. Its recommendations, should they include presidential intervention, would not be binding on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but could lead to additional legislation. The unions have contended that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, has siphoned <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> cash and assets for the parent company and wants to use bankruptcy to kill the unions, as he did when <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged from bankruptcy protection as a non-union carrier <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has said concessions by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s union workers were necessary for it to remain competitive. In another development, a meeting of the Eastern creditors' committee scheduled for Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was canceled <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an attorney representing the creditors' panel, was not immediately available to explain why the session was called off. Eastern's creditors have been studying the company's revised reorganization plan, drawn up after attempts to sell its Latin American routes to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fell through. The creditors' committee had been scheduled to vote on the revised plan on Tuesday Sources close to the situation said late last month that creditors were near agreement on accepting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s revised plan, after the committee dropped plans to develop alternatives to the company's proposal.

Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return telephone calls Tuesday.

<HEAD>Honeywell ``Well Under Way'' in Sale of Defense and Marine Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Tuesday what most analysts had concluded in July when the company announced a sweeping restructuring: Its weapons business is for sale. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> also said the company will further reduce its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese controls maker. In July, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said it would retreat from its $ 1.4 billion weapons business to focus on automated building controls and space and aviation contracts. But <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> did n't confirm until Tuesday at a meeting with financial analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the Minneapolis-based company's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division is for sale. Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON> said the selling process is `` well under way.'' If the unit ca n't be sold, <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> will consider a spin-off or joint venture. `` At this point, based on the level of interest expressed in the business, we expect to sell <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` We expect the sale will generate substantial proceeds that will directly benefit shareholders.'' He did not disclose potential buyers or estimate when a deal could be completed. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Tuesday at $ 80.25 a share, down 25 cents on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Weapon sales last year represented about 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 7.1 billion in revenue. When the unit is pared, the overall percentage of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> sales derived from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contracting will be less than 20 percent. <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said the sale of the weapons business is based on `` a more difficult procurement environment.'' On Oct. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale of 16 percent of its equity ownership in <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> for $ 280 million. On Tuesday, the company said it is negotiating a second sale, most likely a 9 percent stake. That would leave <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> with a 25 percent holding _ still the largest <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> shareholder. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring, which included the reduction of 4,000 jobs, is designed to make the company less attractive to corporate raiders.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had reached a $ 30 million settlement in 20 class action civil suits filed after a January 1988 diesel fuel spill in the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers. Under the proposed settlement, which received preliminary approval Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> will receive credit for about $ 14 million it has paid or agreed to pay to settle claims by businesses, individuals and several states. An additional $ 6.2 million will be paid to defray costs of administering the settlement, attorneys' fees and to provide for compensation for claims of certain parties whose water service was cut off for one or more days. The balance of the funds will be used to satisfy qualifying new claims, wage losses, business interruption and property damage, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was fined $ 2.25 million earlier this year for negligence in the Jan. 2, 1988, spill, which threatened to disrupt drinking water supplies for more than a million people in three states. About 700,000 gallons of oil entered the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which flows into the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when a tank at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s Floreffe Terminal, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, ruptured. Both rivers are sources of drinking water. Authorities blamed the accident on a dime-sized flaw in the tank's World War II-era steel. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the settlement was agreed upon by all parties to avoid expensive and protracted litigation. `` The settlement will be substantially covered by insurance and will not impact the company's earnings,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` This action essentially concludes all outstanding litigation associated with the spill.'' Once it receives final court approval, all claims will be reviewed by a settlement administration committee consisting of a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> and a representative of the plaintiffs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $ 6.5 million, which it blamed on a decrease in demand for the company's computers.
