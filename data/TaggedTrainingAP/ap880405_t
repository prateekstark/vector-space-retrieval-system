 Tens of thousands of Afghans went to the polls Tuesday on the first day of general elections that will be held over 10 days, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> reported. They are the first general elections in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since pro-Soviet military officers seized power ten years ago. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials cast their ballots in the elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. In its first reports, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said voters participated with `` enthusiasm and happiness'' and Tuesday's balloting ended in an orderly manner. But in later broadcasts monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, the government station in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, said rebels fired at some polling stations in four provinces and other areas. The night broadcast said `` in some provinces the elections are taking place in difficult conditions.'' It did not say if there were any casualties. It reported that 147,300 people out of the 955,000 registered voters cast their ballots Tuesday. The broadcast also said there were as many as eight candidates for some legislative seats, and 70 per cent of the candidates were independents. One fourth of the 62 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 229 in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> are set aside for representatives of anti-communist rebel groups, even if they do not participate. In a message to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the elections were `` universal, secret, direct and democratic.'' `` The Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> invites a delegation of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to visit the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in order to see the process of elections,'' his message said. In a separate message to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Afghans and Afghan political forces inside and outside the country were welcome to participate in the elections. About 5 million Afghans have fled the war and live in refugee camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where rebel groups also have headquarters. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said if the return of the refugees is delayed, `` We are also ready to keep a necessary number of seats in both houses of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> until their final return.'' The elections are being held while U.N.-sponsored peace talks are under way in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The key issue in those negotiations is the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Marxist military officers seized power in an April 1978 coup and Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to help the government battle the anti-communist guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, negotiators representing <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> completed five weeks of talks on an Afghan peace settlement. `` There is a constructive atmosphere. I am hopeful that we can in fact succeed shortly,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat who consults regularly with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. A diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, held talks with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s portfolio includes the Afghan conflict. The Soviets have announced they plan to withdraw their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the Soviets to either cut off aid to the Afghan government or allow <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to continue supporting the insurgents.

 Arab hijackers Tuesday forced a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet to land in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, threatened to blow it up and demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 pro-Iranian prisoners. They later released 25 of the 112 people on board. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said without elaboration that the 24 women were released early Wednesday after negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayyeri </PERSON>. A man in poor health was freed Tuesday. Among the other passengers were three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family and a passenger with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport, on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The gunmen warned the Kuwaiti royals would be `` in imminent danger'' if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> refused to free the prisoners, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The hijackers, brandishing pistols and hand grenades, identified themselves only as Arabs. But their demands echoed those of Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Kuwaiti government rejected the hijackers' demand to release 17 prisoners, calling it `` blackmail,'' but said it would listen to other demands, the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the 24 freed women included five stewardesses, and identified them as 10 Britons, three Thais, three Egyptians, a Philippine citizen, a Palestinian, a Singaporean, an Irishwoman, a German, an Austrian, a Syrian and a Pakistani. The agency said the women were driven to a hotel in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> after being questioned by security officers at the airport. After an emergency session, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s government said it will send a three-man delegation on Wednesday morning `` to help Iranian authorities'' secure the passengers' release. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to send a high-ranking delegation to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for direct talks with the hijackers. The hijackers earlier demanded fuel for the aircraft and threatened to blow it up if the Iranians approached. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> initially said the Iranians refueled the plane, but then said the gunmen were still requesting fuel. Iranian security forces surrounded the plane at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport to keep it from taking off, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to handle the incident `` wisely'' and requested that the aircraft not be allowed to leave. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it would try to resolve the crisis peacefully but said the plane would have to leave if it was not resolved quickly. The plane was commandeered three hours after it took off from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> with 97 passengers and 15 crew members. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that the hijackers told the control tower at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport: `` We ask you Iranian officials to mediate between us and the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government if you want. `` Our rights have been usurped ... We have 17 prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jails who are under the worst kind of torture ... `` If you do not want to mediate, we ask for fuel and other needs and then we will take off.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> passenger with a heart condition was freed several hours after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> at 7:30 a.m. -LRB- midnight EDT -RRB-. The passenger, businessman <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, 42, later appeared on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and said five or six hijackers were demanding to fly on to an undetermined location. The passenger list included 30 Kuwaitis, 22 Britons, eight Thais, various other nationalities and one person with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and an Egyptian passport identified only as <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Attiaallaali </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it believed no Americans were aboard. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to see that the hijackers are caught and tried. Airline sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pilot was an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiber </PERSON>, the airline's manager in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruling family aboard were <PERSON> Ibtesam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> and the wife of <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. Hundreds of Kuwaitis are related to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the target of an assassination attempt by pro-Iranian extremists in 1986. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, the wife of British passenger <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, said she was waiting by the phone for more news about her husband, an engineering teacher from <LOCATION> Guisborough </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who was returning from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` He is a very calm and cool-headed person and I am sure he will take it all in his stride,'' she said. `` But I am terrified of what could happen to him.'' The 17 prisoners demanded by the hijackers were jailed in the 1983 bombings that targeted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Shiites holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> also have demanded the prisoners' release. Nine Americans are among the 22 foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The overwhelming majority of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s population is Shiite. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, Sunni Moslems dominate the government. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is the closest Arab nation to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which are locked in a 7 -LCB- - year-old war <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> often accuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of actively aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military effort. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for the airline as saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> first denied the plane permission to land, but reversed its decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> that hijackings were `` against humanitarian and Islamic principles and unacceptable as a political tactic.'' Diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been strained since August when Iranians stormed the embassies of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and brought its diplomats home. Pro-Iranian gunmen hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in December 1984 and demanded the release of pro-Iranian Kuwaiti prisoners. They killed two American passengers before Iranian commandos stormed the aircraft, ending the six-day ordeal.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cautiously criticized <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s involvement in the Panamanian standoff and expressed irritation with Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Monday as he struggled to pull out a victory in the critical <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. In a long, final day of campaigning around the state, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly likened himself to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who scored an important primary victory in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in his 1960 presidential campaign. Campaigning before students in <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, in his last appearance of the night, he urged that those who support him try to round up a little last-minute help. `` When you go home tonight, make a few phone calls, get a hold of your neighbors. Believe me, your work will make the ... difference,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Arriving back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Monday night, he was asked about his prospects in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` We've worked hard. It looks good. But you never know until the votes come in,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s success in reversing a round of steel industry price hikes in 1962, and said he would summon <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> to the White House `` fast'' and demand that he drop plans to close a plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> Polls indicate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are locked in a tight race in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, just as they are running neck and neck nationally in the chase for national convention delegates. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said it was a `` bad idea'' for his Democratic presidential rival to suggest taking on the role of mediator between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But he softened his criticism when he said he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had acted out of good intentions, and again when he said he understood that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had issued a clarifying statement on the subject. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave the country, not offered to mediate. Even so, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I think it's a bad idea for a private citizen to try to inject himself'' into the situation. Asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s much-heralded trip to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1984 when he won the release of captured <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied, `` I think the principle is the same.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was less charitable toward <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who rays the governor has been `` absurdly timid'' in criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for fear of offending black voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cut off one reporter who began to ask about the subject, and said, `` Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ought to start campainging for the presidency.'' He noted that he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> disagree on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, proposals for an oil import fee and other subjects. Asked later if he thought <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were serious about winning the party's nomination, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know what he's serious about.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has n't won any contests outside the South except the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> caucuses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came at a time when aides said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> race appeared extremely tight. While a weekend poll in the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an eight-point lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and his aides portrayed Tuesday's primary as a much closer match-up. `` It's too close to call,'' said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, deputy political director for the campaign. `` We'll take any kind of win we can get.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters, `` I do n't have to win'' in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` I just have to win a good plurality of delegates by June 9,'' the end of the primary season. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is regarded as a critical test of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' candidacy, following losses in earlier industrial state contests in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are running neck and neck in the race for delegates to the Democratic National Convention, and many party leaders have expressed concern that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a black liberal contender with roots in the civil rights movement, would lead Democrats to a crushing defeat in the fall. Thus, a defeat in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> would seriously damage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chances for winning the nomination, and would almost certainly rekindle talk of a draft-Mario <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> movement in the two weeks remaining before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's home state primary on April 19

<TEXT>
 If Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumbles on his way to the White House this November, erstwhile rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> could wind up as the nation's top <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader under a Democratic administration could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>. It might well be called the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> show, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> being joined by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to counter a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president's programs and present alternatives to them. The Ev of Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority leader <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Dirksen teamed with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in a regular series of televised news conferences, <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> became the undisputed `` Mr. Republican'' of his era. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, crowded out of the 1988 Republican field by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has returned to his leadership position in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, serving notice he intends to prod the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> into opening its arms to a wider constituency. Republicans should, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says, address issues of concern to the homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics, day care, education, long-term health care, Medicaid and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must, above all, give more Americans a reason to come our way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our staunchest supporters,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said last week. With a sense of humor that can be dark and biting, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> will have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> was `` full of fun and thunder,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> biographer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, in his 1970 `` Dirksen: Portrait of a Public Man,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader became a television superstar despite a complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in the age of television. `` His tousled hair, long his trademark, was an easily recognizable ensign,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> wrote. `` His deep-throated husky voice, his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> cartoonist <PERSON> Herblock </PERSON> caricatured <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> as a melancholy clown, <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> as a buffoon and straight man. <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> resented the Ev and Charlie tag. He took his partisanship seriously. But <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> said he liked the name, said it reminded him of such other all-American duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs. Some Republicans said they thought the two stood in poor contrast to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the nation's new, youthful and handsome Democratic president. One complained about <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON>'s `` fuzzy hair'' and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON>'s `` big red nose. `` None of this troubled Dirksen,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> wrote, `` for even as the criticisms were being made, he and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> were getting television and press coverage to make the opposition's case against the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration. In time, he sensed, the criticism would wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was now receiving.'' Dirksen and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> used the Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> routine to showcase criticism of the Kennedy domestic program. `` It may be called the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION>, but the Kennedy program is the old New Deal taken out of an old warming oven,'' <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> said. He scored the administration for `` deficit spending, increased government controls, increases in the government payroll, more welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the piper, more taxes.'' By mid 1962 the Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> show was fully launched and obviously effective in stating the Republican case. The ridicule evaporated. No Republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his disheveled flair, rumpled charm and widespread appeal.

 In laid-back <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a little levity has been a hallmark at PSA. But the commuter airline's new parent, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, is lowering the curtain on one PSA feature: stand-up routines by flight attendants. For example, on a recent flight from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant <PERSON> Marka </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> went into her act as the engines revved up. `` Ladies and gentlemen,'' Ms. <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> said, `` We'd like to welcome you aboard Flight 1733 on our way to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.'' Following a panicky gasp in the cabin, Ms. <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> added: `` Just kidding. I wanted to see if you were listening.'' Ms. <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>, who says about 10 percent of her colleagues go for such laughs, was on a roll. `` If you are traveling with infants or small children, or anyone resembling a small child, place your mask on first, then assist the child _ providing they've been good,'' she said. `` And now, for those of you who have not been in a car since 1962, we're going to show you how to fasten your seat belts.'' But the managers of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> are not amused, and this week is Ms. <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>'s last as a kidder. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> is completing a $ 385 million takeover of PSA. `` Our policy is that we discourage that sort of thing because the information is very serious and should be delivered in that vein,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, assistant vice president for public relations at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. PSA, which has smiles painted on the noses of its jets, believes that a light touch is helpful, said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendry </PERSON>, division vice president for the airline's in-flight and dining services. `` As long as the safety announcements are done in the right manner, we think a sense of humor is appreciated at a time that is perceived to be a hassle,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, those irrepressible <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> ice cream makers, found out that it's easier to make Coffee Heath Bar Crunch than to make a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway station shine. About a year ago, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s ice cream has become a favorite of the upscale ice cream set, proposed to spruce up and maintain a subway station on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s upscale <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, just down from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, found the station `` really disgusting.'' Many New Yorkers would say it's better than most. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> offered to spend their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising budget for the year _ $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 _ cleaning, painting and maintaining the station. The Transit Authority said yes. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said no because <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION> wanted to use some non-union workers on the project. Negotiations dragged on and <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> finally set a March 31 deadline. That passed too; the matter went before an independent arbitrator who is expected to rule soon. So on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> set up an ice cream wagon and a van at a park across the street from the station, and began doling out free ice cream as a consolation prize for passengers emerging from the filthy subway stop. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION> were there to promise that they'd keep trying to spruce it up. Nobody seemed to care about the station, though _ not while there was free ice cream to be had.

<HEAD>Average U.S. Household Size Half Civil War Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American households have shrunk to their smallest size ever, containing just half as many people as at the start of the Civil War. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports that the average household contained 2.64 people as of last July 1, continuing a long-term decline. By comparison, the 1860 census found an average household of 5.28 people. While the household size has declined, the number of households has continued to climb, topping 90 million for the first time in 1987, the bureau said Monday. Household size is shrinking because the number of households is increasing faster than the overall population. This is occurring, said bureau population expert <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, because of changes in the country's age structure. The many Americans born in the post-World War II baby boom are now in their 20s and 30s, when they are most likely to set up households on their own, he said. The number of households rose from 80.4 million in 1980 to 88.8 million in 1986 and is now past the 90 million mark. At the same time the average number of persons per household declined from 2.75 in 1985 to 2.65 in 1986 and now to 2.64, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. By comparison, the 1970 Census found the average household contained 3.14 people. In 1930 households averaged more than 4 people, and they averaged more than 5 in 1880. The nation's first census in 1790 found an average household size of 5.79 people. While the growing number of ever smaller households continues a trend, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> pointed out that household growth is n't outpacing population increases as fast as in the 1970s. The same age factors that are increasing households now also occurred then, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. But in addition, in the 1970s the proportion of households in each age group was also growing. That has not continued in the 1980s, he said. `` This could be occurring for a number of reasons,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. For example, in this decade more young people have chosen to remain home with their parents instead of setting up housekeeping on their own, as many had done in the 1970s. This could be caused by the increasing cost of housing, he said. Delays in marriage, while young people pursue careers and school, have also been widely reported as a factor, but <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> cautioned that it is too simplistic to attribute all of the household changes to this. `` There's a whole bunch of things'' that affect the rates, he said. For example, the elderly tend to have high household rates because a fair number are widowed, resulting in many one-person households. Continued low birth rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are also a factor. The presence of children increases household size, while populations with a larger share of adults tend to have smaller households. Asked what the future holds, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said he expects to see households continue to lead population in growth rates over the next few years. `` But that should change at some point'' as the smaller `` baby bust'' generation born following the baby boom comes into the household formation ages. While the national trend was reflected in most parts of the nation, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> cited two states that differ. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, household growth rates were only slightly different from those for population, he said. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the increasing number of Hispanic and Asian residents likely is the reason, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said, since those groups tend to have more people per household. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said, has larger households because it maintains higher fertility than other states, largely because of the influence of the Mormon religion. Households are defined as occupied housing units containing one or more people. The number of households is, on average, smaller than the number of families because the definition of a family requires at least two people, while there are many one-person households.

<TEXT>
 Some 23,000 children and their parents turned the White House south lawn into a kiddie carnival, celebrating an Easter Egg Roll that has been a tradition for 110 years. The children were entertained by an Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> on stilts, by tiny actor <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the `` Webster'' TV show, and by all sorts of cartoon characters from the comic strip `` Peanuts.'' Monday's crowd filled the White House's south grounds where normally helicopters deliver VIPs, bands march and presidents speak. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought his wife, three children and five of his 10 grandchildren. He seemed to have a good time autographing wooden Easter eggs. The rolling was only a small part of the festivities. It consisted of eight youngsters lining up and using wooden spoons to urge their respective eggs toward the finish line. The winners each got a brightly colored wooden egg. So did the losers. On the grounds also were hidden eggs autographed by hundreds of movie stars ranging from Ann-Margret to <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Major Precedent Unlikely in Libel Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A record $ 3 million libel award against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has refused to disturb is not likely to have widespread impact on the news media, says an authority on libel law. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the case does not establish a significant precedent because the facts involved are unique. But <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> did say that the case, stemming from a broadcast on a CBS-owned television station in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, changes the psychological landscape. `` This is the first libel award that has broken through the psychological $ 1 million barrier on appeal, the first that has been able to make it through the process intact,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, whose organization is funded by the news media, expressed disappointment along with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday left the libel judgment intact. News organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a First Amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. `` That opportunity has passed for the time being,'' he said. `` We're disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, associate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We believed these issues were important enough for review.'' The case stems from a suit by <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, which makes Viceroy cigarettes. It accused CBS and <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> of libeling it in a Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, in a nightly feature called `` <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s Perspective,'' said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes `` to pot, wine, beer and sex. He said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as `` an initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit pleasure.'' A federal jury awarded the cigarette company $ 5 million. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld $ 3 million of the award against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and $ 50,000 against <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. The $ 3 million award _ plus some $ 400,000 in interest _ is about four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news organization upheld on appeal. Awards upheld on appeal average between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> case, the appeals court rejected arguments that the broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous. The appeals court said the remarks about Viceroy were intended to be factual, even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like something else. The appeals court also rejected <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that the broadcast was truthful. There was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating cigarettes `` to pot, wine, beer and sex,'' the appeals court said. Finally, the appeals court ruled that <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> acted with `` actual malice'' in broadcasting the commentary. For a public figure to win a libel suit, it must be shown there was actual malice _ that statements were made with knowledge they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. The cigarette company was held to be a public figure. In other action, the court: _ Left intact rulings in a case from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> that public airports may not ban all demonstrations, soliciting and distribution of political and religious literature at their terminals _ Agreed to review rulings that limited <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' financial liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died _ the shooting down of a KAL passenger jet over Soviet _ Reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for treating <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients The unanimous court was led by Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, writing his first opinion since joining the court Feb. 18. _ Rejected a challenge to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s rent-control law that limits yearly increases for affected apartments to 7.5 percent _ Agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> _ the city's mayor, city council president and comptroller and the president of each of the city's five boroughs _ must be reapportioned to meet equal-voting standards

<HEAD>Carriers Report Low Benefit Payout Per Premium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The providers of all-risk crop insurance last year paid out the lowest amount of benefits per premium dollar since a new program went into effect in 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurers </ORGANIZATION>. Farmers carried $ 6.07 billion worth of `` multiple peril'' crop insurance in 1987 on a record 62 million acres of production. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the association, said Monday that farmers paid $ 274 million in 1987 premiums and received $ 335 million in loss payments for the year. Nationally, that meant for each $ 1 paid in premiums, farmers received $ 1.22 in indemnities. The multiple peril crop insurance program includes commercial companies that are reinsured against catastrophic loss by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> also handles insurance directly through master marketers, who account for about 20 percent of the total. Up to 30 percent of a farmer's all-risk insurance premium is subsidized by the <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION>. When the federal subsidies are included, the 1987 premiums totaled $ 365 million, compared with the benefits of $ 335 million. Thus, the 1987 loss ratio was 0.92, or 92 cents paid out for each $ 1 of premium. <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said that was the lowest ratio since the multiple peril crop insurance program began in 1981. Under the program, farmers can buy varying levels of coverage for a variety of crops to insure them against loss from floods, drought, insects and other natural causes. `` As we look forward to 1988, we hope for another good loss ratio performance,'' <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said. `` But we're concerned with dry conditions already cropping up in the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.'' The deadline for farmers to sign up for 1988 crop insurance is April 15 in most areas of the country -LRB- it was March 31 in some of the early planting areas of the South -RRB-, he said. Farmers who produce spring-planted crops also should keep in mind that without crop insurance they are not eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disaster assistance, such as low-interest loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said. The 1987 coverage on 62 million acres of crops compared with 60.7 million acres in 1986 and 46.5 million acres when the program began in 1981. A low point was reached in 1983 when plantings were cut sharply by drought and government acreage programs. Only 31.3 million acres of crops were insured that year. However, the mix of crops and variations in kinds of coverage have resulted in wide variations of coverage value. Last year's $ 6.07 billion in coverage was down from more than $ 6.22 billion in 1986, for example, despite the record acreage And in 1985, coverage totaled nearly $ 7.17 billion on $ 59.1 million.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been given the go-ahead by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said Monday that since April 1987, the subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled more than 11.8 million tons under previously announced allocations of the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. More than 7.6 million tons of the 11.8 million tons of subsidized wheat bought by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has gone to fill its commitment under the fifth and final year of a long-term grain agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets are required to seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval. The Soviets have been given approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. If <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> buys all of the new authorization, that would push wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 8.6 million tons. All of the wheat has been subsidized. In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans; and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or another authorized commodity at competitive world prices. The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $ 20 to more than $ 40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $ 1.09 per bushel.

<HEAD>Cosmetics Firms Warned To Stop Making Anti-Aging Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it is time for cosmetic companies to stop talking and start changing labels that claim skin creams can retard or reverse aging of the skin. The federal agency wrote 22 companies on Monday that it will take another look at the labels in 30 days _ and then crack down on any that persist in misleading claims. `` We believe that <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has clearly stated its views regarding the types of claims that can appropriately be made on cosmetic skin care products and the types of claims that make skin products unapproved new drugs,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, associate commissioner for regulatory affairs. `` Accordingly, we do not believe that a detailed review or a prolonged discussion regarding individual product labeling is necessary. We hope that you will make the changes in your labeling that are necessary to bring it into compliance with the act and with <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s stated views.'' The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics, which can be sold without pre-approval by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, as products intended to cleanse or to beautify superficially. In written warnings to the cosmetic industry last year, the agency said that when a product is said to counteract, retard or control the aging process or to rejuvenate, repair or renew the skin, then those statements put the product in the drug category _ with all its stringent scientific review requirements. That is so, the letter said, because such claims indicate that a `` function of the body, or that the structure of the body, will be affected by the product.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said then it was `` unaware of any substantial scientific evidence that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness'' of the so-called anti-aging skin care products. Implicit in the latest letter was the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> view that talks started with the companies last spring intended to lead to voluntary changes in labeling claims have gone on long enough. Some companies have modified their labels since last spring, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said last November it could not accept the labeling claims continuing to appear on many products. The latest letter said the agency will examine the labeling and promotions of the creams in 30 days and that a product still in `` substantial violation'' may be subject to immediate regulatory action. This can include seizure of products on shelves and court injunctions against further distribution. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action does not involve Retin-A, a prescription acne medication that was widely publicized recently after a study suggested it was effective in removing small wrinkles caused by sun damage to the skin. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> did not release the names of the companies that received the letter.

 One by one, the favorite presidential candidates of some of the nation's union leaders are falling by the wayside. Eight days ago it was <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the personal choice of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> finished a distant third in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses and withdrew last Monday. Today, in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s primary, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union expect their preferred choice, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, to be weeded from the Democratic field. `` Quite sadly, tomorrow is going to show <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to be yesterday's tomatoes,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vattendahl </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION>'s 14,000-member District 32 headquartered in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, said on the eve of the primary While the union was abiding by <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> guidelines to encourage their members to support any candidate of their choice, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had clearly become the choice by default of the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders. The first choice of <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had been <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, whom he has served as an adviser on industrial policy. <PERSON> Vattendahl </PERSON> now believes that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will edge out <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among the union's members in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, who are mostly foundry workers, with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also finishing ahead of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` I would have thought <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would have caught on better; he's been with us for 30 years and we've been with him,'' <PERSON> Vattendahl </PERSON> said `` But it's not happening that way.'' Going into today's votes, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> actually has more delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July among union members than any of the other candidates, all from his victory in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary March 15. The latest <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> tabulations show him with 20 elected labor delegates, followed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 15, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 10, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with six and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with two. The steelworkers were instrumental in persuading <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to stay in the race through the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary and had hoped he would do well enough in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to remain a candidate through the April 26 primary in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where the union has its biggest political strength. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have been on the phone with steelworkers union members around the country who had been supporting <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, offering them delegate slots for their support. `` So far it's being resisted,'' he added. Leaders of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s biggest union, the 48,000 teachers who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will edge out <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among their members today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, has endeared himself to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> union members facing the greatest strife: 5,500 workers at a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> Chrysler plant to be closed next summer and striking meatpackers at <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION> and paper workers at <LOCATION> DePere </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> visited us and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed up at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphry </PERSON>, one of 370 mostly white Paper Workers on strike the past 10 months against <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s De Pere mill. `` But they're just reading off the script <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> wrote,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P-40 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION>, which is striking the <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>' meatpacking plant, has made trips to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to raise campaign money on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s behalf `` The picket line is white, the strikebreakers are black,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The company orchestrated letters to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from scabs saying that he was selling them out. And he replied: A scab is a scab. Our Cudahy people are big <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fans.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has won the endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, which represents the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers, after appearing with them in protest rallies in January when the company announced its intention to close the plant next summer. Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the past week have denounced <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> in campaign appearances, but labor leaders view those actions as too little and too late. `` The problem is people who are striking or are in trouble are the ones who vote, and those who are working do n't,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON>, political director for the bricklayers union and a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter. `` That raises a real question about us getting a November-electable candidate.''

<HEAD>Pollsters Say Wisconsin Crucial in Jackson's Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing in today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary will be a key measure of his emergence as a candidate who could have sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination and the presidency, pollsters say. As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has improved his ability to win votes, the poll analysts noted Monday, the expectations for his campaign have increased. If he has done well, they said, he now needs to do better still. `` It may be a constantly moving target,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>. `` The frontier is moving. Twenty percent of the white Democratic vote and all the black vote is not going to win the election in November.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gained co-frontrunner status when he upset Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses March 26. No polls were done there to indicate the demographics of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then beat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s primary, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got about 20 percent of the white vote. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll last week put <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s white backing at 30 percent. `` In this state certainly he's a viable candidate,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, the Journal editor who ran the poll. Though it gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a slim lead, he said, it probably understated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support by underestimating black turnout. Blacks have been the most reliable of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters throughout the primary season, voting for him with near-unanimity. At the same time, `` You have to have white voters to be a viable candidate,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Klett </PERSON>, poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are some white voters going his way. But it will have to be much larger before he could get the nomination.'' <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary April 19 are crucial to indicate that vote-getting ability, <PERSON> Klett </PERSON> said. `` What happens in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is going to be pivotal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, she suggested, `` has to win one of those states or both.'' `` I would n't put a number on it; it's the number of Democrats that are voting for him,'' <PERSON> Klett </PERSON> said. `` When he gets most of them voting for him, that's when he becomes viable.'' There are other measures as well. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the Journal poll last week showed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a hypothetical general election race by 50 percent to 36 percent. `` That strikes me as extremely close for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in this state, considering how well known <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is and how well liked -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is,'' <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> said. He noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> both fared even better in matchups against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Another issue in gauging <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strength is in the nature of the white votes he is attracting. Exit polls in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said he did best with liberals and lost the blue-collar vote _ critical in the general election _ by 2-1. An analysis of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucus results also indicated that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not particularly strong in blue-collar precincts, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. Still another measure is the share of voters who have a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Although his rating has improved, the last national survey by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, done March 19-22, said more white Democrats had an unfavorable opinion of him _ 39 percent _ than the 31 percent favorable. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. Among all white voters it was 46 percent unfavorable to 22 percent favorable, he said. `` You say to yourself, very few white Republicans are going to vote for him. You then write off half the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> as well, and you're not looking at much of an electoral base,'' said <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. `` You can see why people will be putting increasing hurdles in front of him.'' `` He is increasing his white vote,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> analyst said. `` If that's the case it may be acceptable to say, Let's see how far you can go with this. Can you reach the point where you can win in November? Twenty percent is not there. I would guess it's not 30 percent.'' I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chief of polling for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said he retained his view that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is able but unlikely to win the nomination and unable to win in November. He cited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s liberal positions as well as `` an element of racism that exists in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today. Nonetheless, ` There's already been a profound change. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been to a certain extent legitimized by his very impressive victories,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. In turn, he said, whatever the outcome, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is legitimizing blacks as legitimate presidential contenders.''

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, will undergo questioning shortly in the criminal investigation of her husband about her own $ 40,000-a-year job, say sources familiar with the case. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is trying to determine whether longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for jobs, said sources familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has retained the same <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm representing her husband, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said last week that his investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job, would continue at least until the end of April. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s post with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said a lawyer for the chapter, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> A lawyer for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, has told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had suggested Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for a job with a local radio station owned by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> took the position with the <ORGANIZATION> MS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> instead. However, <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the $ 40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary with the MS group Calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary were not returned. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been a volunteer for the <ORGANIZATION> MS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also was questioned in an earlier independent counsel's investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in 1984. In that investigation, independent counsel <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> probed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a $ 15,000 loan by <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> later became <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistant counselor at the White House. The independent counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> will face an ethics investigation by his own department's Office of Professional Responsibility if <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> does n't seek an indictment Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s files on the attorney general's dealings with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> were moved to <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> last Friday, the sources said. Material collected by <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s criminal division last year led to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in connection with his involvement with a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline touted by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> or his involvement with the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies at a time when he held $ 14,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock. In December, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he did n't have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said that if he decides not to seek a criminal indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the independent counsel's office `` will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,'' a reference to OPR <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION>'s chief, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, denied assertions by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ties to longtime friend <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> last year. That review was halted when <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> launched his criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> last May 11, the sources said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s once-impoverished presidential campaign is showing new fund-raising strength, collecting an impressive $ 2.2 million in donations during March _ more than he raised during all of last year. The sum, coming mostly in contributions of $ 50 or less, represents a dramatic upswing for what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> frequently boasts is the `` poor campaign with the rich message.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, finance chairman for the Democratic field's consistent fund-raising leader, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was laudatory when told Monday about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s money `` That's a tremendous achievement for Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Anybody that can raise $ 2 million in a month is a hero to me.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, collected donations totaling more than $ 2.5 million during March, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> raised about $ 1.5 million during March, his campaign said last week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been picking up most of his money in small contributions through an aggressive direct-mail and telemarketing program. The program banked $ 1 million during March, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mail consultant, <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> He said the returns are the most impressive of any campaign he has ever conducted in 10 years of fund-raising. Farmer said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gotten contributions averaging $ 135 each over the past 90 days. During all of 1987, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised just under $ 2 million, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised $ 10.8 million. `` He has emerged as a significant player and that's reflected in his financial performance,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` You're beginning to see this as a two-man race and the fund raising is the first benchmark of success. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` should be very proud'' of his mail returns. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s March receipts surprised even campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, who had projected contributions of about $ 1 million. In all, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> collected $ 3 million, including about $ 800,000 in federal matching funds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took in about $ 3.4 million, including $ 875,000 in federal matching funds. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s fund-raising boost is timely as the expensive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary approaches on April 19. `` They're really banking for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, noting that television ad time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is particularly expensive. By contrast, she said, the campaign spent a total of $ 100,000 on today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary, with about half going to TV ads. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> generally relies on a grassroots network of volunteers, eliminating the large payroll common to more wealthy campaigns. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mail returns `` have picked up since Super Tuesday,'' when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> polled first in popular vote and second in delegates across 20 state primaries and caucuses on March 8. In addition to the direct mail campaign, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised about $ 140,000 during a two-day fund-raising swing through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where national campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> put on a series of fund-raising events. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also collected about $ 120,000 at events in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prior to the March 26 caucuses where he won a landslide victory. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got about half his March donations from three days of big-ticket fund-raising events in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said.

 Two Cabinet secretaries and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director have attested to <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s character in letters to the judge who will sentence the former presidential aide for illegal lobbying. Letters signed by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> are among 62 attached to a defense brief that urges a short term of unsupervised probation for <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. In a three-page letter, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> to show `` compassion and understanding'' for <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. `` Society has been paid by what he has gone through in this trial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of four members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who sent letters, urged <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> to consider `` balancing the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> wrote about <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s role as White House spokesman on March 30, 1981, after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been shot and taken to <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once Mr. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> took the podium,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> recalled, he quickly became aware `` of the rapport and the trust the press had for any statements he made.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday on three counts of illegally lobbying former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the manufacturer of the A-10 anti-tank plane, and a maritime engineers union. He could receive a two-year prison term and a $ 10,000 fine for each of the three felony violations of the Ethics in Government Act. Last week, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> urged a prison term of unspecified length and a fine, arguing that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> flouted the law and was unrepentant following his conviction Feb. 11. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had likened his crime to `` running a stop sign.'' The defense brief that was filed Monday said imprisonment `` would unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation Mr. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> has already suffered as a result of his indictment and trial.'' Accusing <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of making a `` vindictive'' and `` mean-spirited'' sentencing request, defense lawyers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said `` it is inconceivable that a sentence other than probation is appropriate under these circumstances.'' Former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, R-Nev., said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> `` has been deeply wounded and punished _ physically, emotionally and financially. Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Delich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., called <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> `` a man of impeccable character and integrity'' who would `` never do anything which he understood to be morally wrong.

<HEAD>Dear General Noriega:</HEAD>

 On behalf of all those around the world who see and feel the agony of the Panamanian people, I am writing to appeal to you _ for all of us _ to pursue peace and to put an end to this crisis. The whole forest is being set afire to smoke you out, and the strategy is causing great suffering in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ a suffering seen around the world. The livelihood, health and safety of Panamanians are threatened. It is time to put these considerations in the proper perspective for the country's good. A judgment for a greater good must be made. A judgment for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and for the region must be made! By us working together for peace, we can help heal the sick, feed the hungry and put your country back together. I have been to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> several times and have a great feeling, sensitivity and respect for the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I agonize daily as I watch the suffering. I have talked with people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who now have desperation added to their destitution. I make this appeal reluctantly because I know the history of our country with your country has been a complex one. But suffice it to say that the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> brought us closer together in harmony. I am appealing for us to relieve the people of the suffering and the bloodshed that may occur. I am anxious to do whatever I can to help alleviate the suffering, but we must act decisively and quickly. I appeal to you for us to find a way to end the crisis now. I am therefore asking <PERSON> Cirilo </PERSON> <PERSON> McSween </PERSON>, my dear friend who has accompanied me to your country on my visits, to see you immediately so that these dialogues surrounding this moral appeal may begin.

<HEAD>Mexico Cheapest, Norway Most Expensive In US Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had the lowest labor costs last year and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> had the highest as measured in dollars, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. Average hourly costs in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> went down to $ 1.37 from $ 1.49 in 1986, the department said in its report, released Monday. Though wages more than doubled in Mexican pesos, the exchange value of the peso dropped so far that the dollar cost declined. Brazilian workers saw their wages and benefits rise when measured in cruzados, but in dollar terms there was a decline to $ 1.49 from $ 1.60 an hour because of the low value of the domestic currency. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are the Third World's two biggest debtors, a situation that tends to drive down the price of their currencies. They were the only countries where the dollar cost of labor was reported to have dropped in the year. The figures take account of the fall in the price of the dollar, and of changes in local pay rates. The costs of social insurance and other benefits are also figured. But the figures do not consider whether some workers are more efficient than others. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s average compensation of $ 17.58 an hour was nearly 13 times <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s dollar amount. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average of $ 13.46 dollars was almost 10 times <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s. Low wage costs in other countries have long been used by politicians as the reason for protecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry from imports. Labor unions also have complained against `` exporting jobs,'' arguing that low labor costs in other countries encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers to set up production there rather than at home. Labor in the newly-industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> remained less than a fifth as costly as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of 22 countries surveyed, seven had costs higher than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate here. They were, in addition to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, $ 17.06; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, $ 16.83; <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, $ 15.14; <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, $ 15.11 dollars; <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, $ 15.08 and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> $ l4 .49 dolllars All 23 countries for which the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had statistics showed an increase of compensation in their own currency, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relative cost level in 1987 -LRB- of 84 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> costs -RRB- greatly exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in 1986,'' said the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. It noted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s level was now close to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s. The increase was due largely to the rise of the yen against the dollar. The high value of the domestic currency against the dollar was also the reason for most of the rise in European costs, though they were also raised in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> by cuts in working hours, the report said.

 Here is the text of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as released Monday by the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. It was written in response to a March 23 letter from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The text, as released by the campaign, contained several fragmentary sentences, misspellings, and other irregularities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dear Reverend Jackson:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 With sincere emotion, I read your most attentive letter, addressed to me, dated March 23, delivered by <PERSON> Cirilo </PERSON> <PERSON> McSween </PERSON>, in which you expressed your moral concern for the political and economic living conditions of the Panamanian people. Your concern for the crisis which has provoked great suffering and your appeal to me to persist in seeking peace and to put an end to this crisis, you expressed your anxiety to do whatever is possible to help alleviate the suffering and that we should act immediately. Your reputation as a great moral authority obligates me to give consideration and pay attention to your appeal, so that we may work together for the peace and unification of my country. In this sense, I manifest that it has always been one of the objectives of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and mine, to try to keep social peace for the Panamanian brothers and sisters and the foreigners that reside in our country. Our doctrine of National Security is inspired in the ideals of social justice and not of military concepts. I am sure that you are aware of the deep internal and external aspects of the political and economic situation now they have been destabalizing our consitutional Panamanian institutions so as to have a country that is weak and ruined, so it becomes an easy prey for the dictates of foreign forces. I am sure that you know the details of the amalgam between professional Panamanian politicians that are now dressed in sheepskin, and the legislative and executive sectors of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, who have translated an open and barefaced intervention into the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with the final proposition that they do not give compliment to the covenant of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty of 1977. No Panamanian with a firm nationalistic and patriotic sentiment would ever accept that the solution of internal problems of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, be dictated from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- Consequently, I find it unnecesary to repeat this answer to your letter with more details in the wheel of the Panamanian crisis. There is something that has awakened my curiosity and come to my attention: How is it possible that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Administration who has publicly made gala of great love for God and have profound religious sentiment has campaigned terrible economic sanctions that have been imposed on the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, causing the kind of suffering that you feel sincerely inhuman, causing the threat of brutal military forces, the sabotage, the psychological war against a materially small and weak country, but a dignified coungry, just like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> is the actual Head of State of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by Constitutional decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>; it is recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. He has recently called for a sincere national dialogue between all the sectors of the Panamanian society, with the purpose of a specific solution for the Democracy of our country, with up-coming celebration of free and open elections of May 1989. The Defense Forces support this cause by the Panamanian Chief of State and at the same time, reject any imposition and any political and economic program that will be dictated from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The word, `` perpetuity'' has been historically imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Unied </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the different Canal Treaties since 1903. Nevertheless, I assure you that, those words do not form a part of my personal vocabulary, nor of my honor in the military. My duration as Commander and Chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is governed by the Panamanian Constitution and Law of the Defense Forces. You can do a lot to help, by eliminating one of the principal causes of the suffering of many Panamanians. In other words, the foreign intervention. You may contribute by your knowledgeable advice and create by mutual communition, the harmony and the material peace between all Panamanians, without discrimination of any class. With my deepest respect for you, I shall be at your disposition to speak with you more deeply about this theme whenever you are available. Attentively, P.S. I have been lied about! I have been villafied! I have been humiliated internationally! I consider myself to have been persecuted by illegal actions by so-called justice, by political interests of your nation. I, as a Christian, before you, denounce this untrue, because how is it possible that nation as powerful should employ the services of journalistic mis-information, the threat of death bdfore one of God's children, such as I consider to be at the present time in this struggle? This is my testimony, <PERSON> Reverend </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, before the Divine and Eternal Laws of the all-powerful God. I feel rich in faith and find my situation in <ORGANIZATION> Isaiah </ORGANIZATION> 45, with all humility and reverence.

<HEAD>Wright Adviser Details Effort To Sell Weapons To Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An adviser to House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he contacted <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> nearly two years ago in a bid to broker a weapons deal for the Contras but did not know he was tapping into the North private aid network. In a deposition taken by congressional Iran-Contra investigators and released Monday, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said that he only met <PERSON> North </PERSON> once briefly and that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> `` may have mentioned'' North. He said he had a sense that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a public relations man with ties to the Contras, might be able to get a weapons offer to them and so <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked him about the possibility in the spring of 1986. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat and longstanding opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras, has said he had no idea his friend and adviser was trying to sell them weapons. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff member, has traveled to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s observer and emissary in the evolving peace process between the U.S.-backed Contras and the leftist Nicaraguan government. North is charged in the Iran-Contra affair on a variety of counts stemming from his clandestine operation to supply the Contras. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> named <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a co-conspirator when <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pleaded guilty to illegally using a tax-exempt foundation for the non-exempt purpose of raising money to arm the Contras. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee, said last week that he does not recall if the committee staff ever told him about <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>'s connection or that <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> had given a <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was not called as a witness by the committee. At the time of the contact with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved $ 100 million in new aid for the rebels after a cutoff that had left the Contras supplied only through North's secret operation. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was trying to see that some of that money be used to purchase items such as grenades and bombs from a Chilean arms manufacturer. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told the investigators he knew only that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had a public relations involvement with the rebels, but he sensed there was `` something there'' that could lead to an arms deal. Investigators asked him why he would go to the head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firm rather than just dealing directly with the Contras from the start. `` He seemed to have had a very good working relationship with them,'' <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said. `` He told me that he would talk to the right people in the administration.'' But <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> subsequently took the arms proposal directly to the Contras, according to documents referred to in his deposition. He gave <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> official <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matamoros </ORGANIZATION> a list of weapons available from the Chilean company, <PERSON> Industrias </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoen </PERSON>, on Aug. 12, 1986. On Aug. 15, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> wrote a letter to a front company in the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had set up to handle his Contra transactons with <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and to which he had told <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> to address the proposal. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> included the weapons list with his letter. `` I passed it on to Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in his deposition. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked me to pass it on to whoever the appropriate person was.'' <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said nothing ever came of the offer. Asked if he had any personal contact with <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said he had met him many years ago at an Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reception. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, who works for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firm, has not returned several messages left at his office in the past 11 days.

 A power fluctuation caused lights to flicker and dim Monday in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and was blamed for a minor radioactive gas leak, officials said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, administrative manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> based here, said utility employees in the affected states were working to discover the cause. In portions of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, power went completely out for a brief period, but in most of the affected areas power levels were only reduced, he said. The trouble occurred at 2:18 p.m. MDT, he said. There were no reports of serious problems resulting from the power dips, he said. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials said the fluctuation caused a radioactive gas leak and temporarily closed the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> Nuclear Generating Station near <LOCATION> Platteville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Severts </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the leak posed no danger to the public or plant workers. He said it was less than one-thousandth of the concentration the utility is authorized to release on a scheduled basis. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaysen </PERSON>, customer service manager for <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> Light, <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the fluctuation to problems at a Grizzly, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, substation that idled three generating stations in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON> said he had heard nothing about the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> substation. `` There is a lot of speculation going around. We'd rather not speculate,'' <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is one of nine regional councils that coordinate power distribution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The regional councils were created after a 1965 East Coast power outage.

<HEAD>Split Decision In Minnesota Likely For Jackson, Dukakis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are virtually tied in the race for delegates from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where a plurality of state convention delegates have moved into the uncommitted column. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose campaign estimated last month that he would win more than twice as many national convention delegates as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, was clinging to a one-vote lead among delegates elected to the state convention. With returns from county conventions, accounting for 75 percent of the 1,262 delegates elected to the state convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was supported by 219 while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 218 and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 78. Another 423 state convention delegates were uncommitted. If these results held up at the state and congressional district conventions, where <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> pick 78 of their national convention delegates in May and June, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would win 19 national delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would receive 18, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would gain one and 40 would be uncommitted. `` I do n't know if anything has really happened,'' said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who oversees national delegate selection for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` I've always viewed this as an evolving process. `` We view this as a very active delegate-selection process, and we'll be trying in the weeks ahead to win as many delegates as we can from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Minnesotans began their delegate-selection process on Feb. 23 with precinct caucuses but because of a conflict with national party rules, the results of those caucuses were never clearly reported. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Growe </PERSON> tried to produce a count on caucus night, but the results were incomplete and in some places were tallied incorrectly. The state party itself tried to produce a count two weeks later based on a paper ballot filled out at the caucuses, but so many of the ballots were disallowed that those results too became unreliable. Based on <PERSON> Growe </PERSON>'s results, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign earlier had projected that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would end up with 27 of the 78 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> delegates that are elected through the process that begins with the precinct caucuses. According to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's initial tally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would have received 13 delegates each, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would have received one, and 24 delegates would have been uncommitted. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign shut down its campaign office in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> following the precinct caucuses. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign workers will be returning to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> after the Tuesday's primary in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` Our plans are, as soon as we're through with <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a number of people working there will be freed up to work on our efforts in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and I expect we will put a lot of effort into that state,'' he said. `` In terms of the effort we would like to make there, it's most effective to work in the latter stages of the caucus process, in terms of getting out your supporters,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumbles on his way to the White House this November, erstwhile rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> could wind up as the nation's top <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader under a Democratic administration could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>. It might well be called the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> show, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> being joined by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to counter a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president's programs and present alternatives to them. The Ev of Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority leader <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Dirksen teamed with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in a regular series of televised news conferences, <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> became the undisputed `` Mr. Republican'' of his era. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, crowded out of the 1988 Republican field by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has returned to his leadership position in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, serving notice he intends to prod the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> into opening its arms to a wider constituency. Republicans should, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says, address issues of concern to the homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics, day care, education, long-term health care, Medicaid and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must, above all, give more Americans a reason to come our way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our staunchest supporters,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said last week. With a sense of humor that can be dark and biting, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> will have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> was `` full of fun and thunder,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> biographer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, in his 1970 `` Dirksen: Portrait of a Public Man,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader became a television superstar despite a complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in the age of television. `` His tousled hair, long his trademark, was an easily recognizable ensign,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> wrote. `` His deep-throated husky voice, his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> cartoonist <PERSON> Herblock </PERSON> caricatured <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> as a melancholy clown, <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> as a buffoon and straight man. <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> resented the Ev and Charlie tag. He took his partisanship seriously. But <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> said he liked the name, said it reminded him of such other all-American duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs. Some Republicans said they thought the two stood in poor contrast to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the nation's new, youthful and handsome Democratic president. One complained about <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON>'s `` fuzzy hair'' and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON>'s `` big red nose. `` None of this troubled Dirksen,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> wrote, `` for even as the criticisms were being made, he and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> were getting television and press coverage to make the opposition's case against the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration. In time, he sensed, the criticism would wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was now receiving.'' Dirksen and <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> used the Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> routine to showcase criticism of the Kennedy domestic program. `` It may be called the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION>, but the Kennedy program is the old New Deal taken out of an old warming oven,'' <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON> said. He scored the administration for `` deficit spending, increased government controls, increases in the government payroll, more welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the piper, more taxes.'' By mid 1962 the Ev and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> show was fully launched and obviously effective in stating the Republican case. The ridicule evaporated. No Republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his disheveled flair, rumpled charm and widespread appeal.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis, with its uncertainties and hardships, has prompted concern among the more than 1,100 Americans and their families who still live in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone. The artificially high quality of life the zone afforded Americans for more than 60 years before it was returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1979 has changed, and there are fears that Americans could be casualties of the political turmoil. About 1,300 American troops are to arrive this week to protect the 10,000 soldiers assigned to watch the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and to guard American lives and property. But that does not convince all the Americans in the zone that they are secure. `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- army is for the army,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahren </PERSON>, the wife of a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> ship pilot who has lived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> 10 years. During the worst days of the recent crisis, she said, she was refused permission to shop at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military-run grocery stores even after the military advised against going into the city to shop because of protests and riots. `` It burns me up,'' she said. `` The army should not have slammed its doors in our face.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> existed, it had its own police force, courts, clubs, schools, stores and even postage stamps. The 10-mile strip that ran the width of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was a self-contained, subsidized enclave whose residents could forget they were in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Legally, they were not. The zone was turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1979 as part of the 1977 treaties that transfer control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of this century. The zone is now feeling the problems of one of the region's more unstable countries. Since June, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been rocked by sometimes-violent protests as opposition groups pushed for the ouster of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as head of the 15,000-member Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the power behind the civilian government. He is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks have been closed since March 3, creating a critical cash shortage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen Panamanian money held in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and imposed other economic sanctions. The unguarded entrance to the canal zone is across a boulevard from one of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s toughest neighborhoods, which is filled with old barracks used in some cases to house workers who built the canal for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1904 to 1914. Street gangs occasionally enter the area, something unheard of in the old days. `` It's the lull before the storm,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Fahren </PERSON>. `` We used to go out to the beach, everywhere. Now you do n't even see people out on the streets.'' Some residents are third-generation Zonians, as long-term residents are known, but they are getting fewer and some zone residents talk now of sending families back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I have a daughter who will go to <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> this fall,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, deputy branch agent for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the organization of pilots who guide ships through the canal. `` She is scheduled to come back but I may not bring her back,'' said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> 20 years. `` I have a boy in the 11th grade and I'm looking for a place for him to stay in the States,'' he said. `` Even if Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> goes tomorrow, how long will it be before things are normal again here?'' Several residents said they were worried that the Panamanian Defense Forces are responsible for their security. `` What I see as the worse scenario _ the worst possible scenario _ is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep the pressure up and back <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into a corner and he will grab four or five -LRB- Americans -RRB- as hostages,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, also a canal ship pilot who already has sent his family back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He is one of 120 of the canal's 230 pilots who works on a six-four plan under which he works six weeks straight and has four weeks off. There is a waiting list to get six-four status, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said, mostly because of pilots who want to send their families out and be with them for a month every six weeks. `` A lot wanted to do so before all of this started. Now they really want to do it,'' he said. The number of Americans in the old zone has been reduced by about half since the treaties were negotiated. The Americans either work for the canal or the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Some left the zone before the treaties were signed by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the late Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Others stayed, hoping the treaties would not be ratified, then left when they were. The third exodus, he said, came in 1983 when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> assumed control of police functions in the former zone.

 It's taken most of her 68 years, but entertainer-businesswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> says she has finally learned to live alone without fretting. `` The last five years is the first time I'm not married in my life, and I've found my center _ a sense of self-responsibility,'' said <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, who is promoting her upcoming autobiography, to be published by <PERSON> Little-Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, the younger sister of actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and the former co-star of the television series `` Green Acres,'' has been married five times. `` I enjoy, really enjoy, living alone, which is strange for a lady who was the clinging vine of all times,'' she said recently. `` I became a grown-up being, an idea I always fought, and have discovered that it's better to live alone and be at peace with yourself than to be married and to be under continuous stress.'' Besides running her 16-year-old, international wig business and tending her garden at home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> works for AIDS patients and cancer victims. `` To die with AIDS is to die without dignity,'' she said. `` I've seen it in my hospice work You are treated like a leper.

<TEXT>
 With his ouster, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> joined a short but ignominious list of convicted governors, among them a chief executive whoused the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to surround his Capitol and one who declared martial law. Monday's vote by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to sustain the two articles of impeachment made <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached and removed from office in 59 years. Legal scholars say impeachment was devised in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> used it as a way to flex its muscle against kings and ministers. Impeachment was brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in colonial days as a way to protect democracy. `` It's basically, ` You're fired.' Impeachment is a way to get out of office those officials that violate the public trust,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON>. Had he been acquitted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would have joined the likes of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the flamboyant `` Kingfish'' of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, among governors who were impeached by legislators but not convicted. Instead, he became one of seven chief executives who have been removed from office, including the first governor of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and a pair of governors in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> was removed in 1871 for misappropriating school funds, but the impeachment proceedings subsequently were expunged from the legislative record and in 1888 he was elected to another term as governor. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> was removed in 1923 after he declared martial law and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to disband a grand jury that was investigating him. Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, used equally strong tactics to try to prevent an investigation of him. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to surround the Capitol to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> from assembling to conduct the probe. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who was removed in 1929, was the last governor ousted from office by legislators before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Also on the list is Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, who was removed in 1871 after he unconstitutionally suspended the right of habeas corpus and sent militia to quell violence by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, which was accused of murders aimed at frightening blacks into not voting. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the governor need only commit `` high crimes, misdemeanors, or malfeasance'' to face impeachment. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, convicted of obstruction of justice and misusing funds, is the first <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor to be impeached. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> was impeached by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>' colonial Assembly in 1781. Among the charges was that he had fled with unseemly haste when British troops attacked the capital. Although the Assembly soon backed down, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> insisted on a trial and won vindication. Long was impeached on charges of misusing state funds in 1929. The case was dropped when 15 senators _ enough to block conviction _ announced their support for the governor.

 Two jet warplane crashes near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> nuclear power plants have increased criticism of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pilot-training practices, and one newspaper's coverage of the issue has angered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Tens of thousands of West German protesters joined traditional Easter peace marches and vigils that began Saturday and lasted through Monday. This year the demonstrators not only called for scrapping nuclear arms, but they also protested the two air crashes that occurred near atomic power plants just over 24 hours of each other last week. The Association for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, a West German organization of private pilots, joined the protesters in demanding that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> keep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants. `` The chance of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident was more than likely very slim, but it happened anyway,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, spokesman for the group, pointed out in a radio interview. The respected <ORGANIZATION> Wickert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> polled West Germans and found that 15 percent want <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to halt its low-level military training flights over this nation. Two-thirds of the 1,710 people polled said such flights were necessary but the number should be reduced, the Tuebingen-based institute said Saturday. A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from a nuclear power plant in the southern state of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, killing the pilot. `` We escaped the worst imaginable accident by only a split-second,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinzierl </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bavarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, said after the crash. One day later, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 fighter jet crashed in the southern town of <LOCATION> Forst </LOCATION>, demolishing three houses and killing a resident and the pilot. The accident occurred nine miles east of another nuclear power plant. Federal officials say nuclear power plants are sufficiently protected from even a direct hit by falling warplanes, but protesters say such assurances are based only on theory. West German newspapers have given intense coverage to the debate of the possible threat from jet warplane crashes. On Sunday, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper printed a front-page article headlined `` This Junk Flies Over Our Heads,'' accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patched-up <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16. The newspaper quoted an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employee at <LOCATION> Sembach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, located near the southwest city of <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>, as saying poor maintenance and a shortage of spare parts made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 planes unsafe. The report said 110,000 low-level military practice flights were conducted over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> annually by seven NATO-member air forces, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials were upset over what he described as <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>'s `` highly inaccurate report.'' He said he could not verify how many low-level flights were made over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The spokesman said the Americans would coordinate a response to the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> article because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is but one of several countries involved in low-level training flights here. He declined to elaborate. Other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations that regularly train in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> airspace include <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Another spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> European headquarters at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> that the photograph in <LOCATION> Bild </LOCATION> was not of an F-16. `` The Bild picture shows a non-operational F-4 which has been parked near the -LRB- perimeter -RRB- fence on Sembach for some time,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` It's not an F-16 and does n't even have a motor. It's only used by technicians to practice fuselage-patching so they will be proficient in getting a damaged airplane back in the air in wartime,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> establishment are holding their breath today while <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> votes. Not to mention <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the scenario-spinners who are watching the Democratic drama play itself out. In his wildest dreams, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> probably never imagined that he'd be engaged in a state-by-state duel with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the nomination Or running neck-and-neck with his black rival in a state that is 96 percent white and may have a profound influence over the winner of the Democratic presidential marathon. A victory would restore some of the luster that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gained with his Super Tuesday wins last month in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and elsewhere. A defeat would compound stinging losses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and raise serious new questions about the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's ability to compete. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defeat would almost certainly lead to another round of Cuomo-drafting scenarios in the two weeks before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. For all the talk of rallying around the candidate with the most delegates, enough <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders are worried about a Jackson-led party debacle this fall to make some sort of draft movement extremely likely if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> falters. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a victory would make him the leading contender in the nomination fight, in fact if not in delegate totals. A defeat might suggest that his remarkable campaign has peaked _ just as he moves into the delegate-rich states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> over the next month. For Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a victory would be miraculous. The result forecast by the polls _ third place _ would be another devastating finish to an expensive effort. And already <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides are seeking to undermine <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign. The fourth man in the race, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, would settle for survival. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the marathoner, told reporters on Monday, `` I do n't have to win'' in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> `` I just have to win a good plurality of delegates by June 9,'' the day the primary season ends. His aides were doing their best to cushion the impact of a possible defeat, as well, although <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters, `` I think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to win by enough _ 3, 4, 5 points.'' Even before the polls opened today in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> for the state's Democratic presidential primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides were explaining why their man might lose in this industrial state to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as he did in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> 10 days ago and in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> before that The Illinois loss was the result of facing two favorite sons at the same time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the governor's aides argued. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> loss was the result of a primary-caucus hybrid and a large black vote in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that played into <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s hands, they added. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> allows crossover votes, meaning that mischievous Republicans could vote for the Democrat who now appears to be least likely to beat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. So has it gone with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in recent weeks: trying to explain the last big-state loss while hoping to lower public expectations about the contest just ahead. All the while, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is hoping that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tide will crest before it engulfs him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took advantage of his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary victory and a full week of campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to retool his campaign. He talked gingerly of differences between himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, served lunch to senior citizens and visited hospitalized children in an attempt to shed his image as an aloof technocrat. He unveiled a new speech designed to appeal to blue-collar voters. All that simply raised the stakes for him in the state. By whatever reckoning, a loss in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> would leave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> winless in the first three Midwestern industrial states, and raise fresh questions about whether he has the ability to gain the type of blue-collar support needed to produce a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November. From there, it's only a short hop to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who has flirted all year with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and whose state holds the next primary in two weeks. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> would mean <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> could only stay on the sidelines, possibly deciding to embrace the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor before New Yorkers vote. A <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> victory in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and the draft-Cuomo movement will take on new urgency. Forget about <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Barring a miracle in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, his candidacy is over. What about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>? Going into <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, he had performed abysmally since his Super Tuesday successes on March 8. So poorly, in fact, that he is in debt and ineligible for federal campaign matching funds. He poured money into <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, in hopes of gaining the 20 percent of the vote needed to requalify.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicted he would get a boost in today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary from the undecided vote swinging his way. Public opinion surveys showed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> trailing <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the primary, in which 81 Democratic delegates are at stake. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> predicted he will get a bigger share of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> vote than polls indicated. `` It's now clear to me, after the conversations with voters of the last few days, and on the basis of the telephone calls to undecided voters ... that the undecided vote here in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is shifting decisively in our favor,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who did well in last month's Super Tuesday contests, is in need of a Northern win. And a victory here would give him a boost going into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> trailed far behind the two front-runners in Monday's <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses Speaking to supporters Monday in this community troubled by business shutdowns and layoffs, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said corporations must be encouraged to invest their profits in expansion that creates jobs, and that an employer should be required to give adequate notice to his workers when planning to close shop. `` I was an original co-sponsor of the legislation to require a different approach to plant closings, to have notification of plant closings and projected layoffs,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` This would give working men and women an opportunity to make other plans and to get job training, and would also provide them the opportunity to work with management to try to salvage a plant before it closes,'' he said. A day earlier, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been `` absolutely timid'' about criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gives the impression of being scared to death ... That is the opposite of the bold leadership,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator criticized both rivals for their lack of experience in national affairs. Neither <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` has had as much as a single day in national government'' to prepare themselves for the presidency, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said it was likely the Democratic National Convention would meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with no candidate possessing enough delegate strength to win the nomination. `` It likely will go more than one ballot,'' he said. `` It's going to be a long, hard contest.

<TEXT>
 Some <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters just shook their heads in disbelief, others cried, and one victorious opponent said she was `` heartsick.'' But through it all <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sat stone-faced as his governorship was taken from him. `` It should have been close. I do n't know what happened,'' said <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, who had joined a knot of formerly festive supporters before Monday night's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote singing and chanting outside the Capitol. `` I feel betrayed by our Legislature. I had more faith in them.'' A few supporters cried outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chambers as the voting was heard on portable televisions and radios. Some booed and vowed to oust those voting against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> next November. Others just shook their heads in disbelief. Inside, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sat at the defense table between lawyers and showed virtually no emotion as the vote removing him from office was tallied, 21-9 on the charge of obstructing justice, 24-6 on the charge of misusing funds. `` Well, they do n't like my politics so we finished a political trial; it's as simple as that,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told reporters smiling broadly in the hallway before a quick departure from the Capitol. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was n't required to attend the vote, and his attorney, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, said earlier he had advised him to stay away. The governor listened as senators explained their votes, some castigating the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> as a liar and accusing him of misusing power. As <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sat at the defense table, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he gave him `` the impression that he was almost resigned to the fact that he knew it was coming.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached and removed from office in nearly six decades. `` There's no joy in anyone's hearts today,'' said Democrat <PERSON> Lela </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, who voted to convict on both counts. `` I'm heartsick.'' A small number outside cheered the conviction, but most of the 200 or so assembled came to support the ousted governor. They sang `` God Bless America'' after the verdict, and cheered <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> as he departed and offered a brief wave to the crowd. `` It's no surprise,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON>. `` It's a kangaroo court.'' Many in the crowd listened to the proceedings on a sound system used by a country' n' western band to entertain protesters. The festivities even included a homegrown version of the ditty `` Elvira'' _ `` Ev Meeecham.'' The loudest cheer of the day came when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> declined to invoke the `` Dracula clause'' _ a measure that would have barred <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from holding future office in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Earlier, some 300 <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters staged an 11th hour protest and mock funeral for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION>, complete with trumpters playing `` Taps'' and pallbearers toting a black wooden coffin. It turned out to be a burial for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s administration. Some wore railroad attire and blew a train-like whistle, and paper railroad tracks were laid across the plaza because, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters said, the embattled chief executive was being railroaded by the Legislature. A `` Thank Heaven For Evan'' sign was taped to the building. The anti-Mecham group included <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, who carried a sign saying simply `` Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.'' `` I'm very happy and relieved. I think he's a menace, and I think he's clearly guilty of malfeasance,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, who took time out during the voting to snap a few pictures of the crowd and the reporters assembled outside. `` This is history,'' he said. `` Nothing like this will ever happen again.''

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> edged ahead of rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses early Tuesday, after a night of furious see-saw battling. Meanwhile, Republicans pointed to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as their heavy favorite. With 1,234 of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 2,784 precincts reporting, or 44 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 45 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 40 percent. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had just 4 percent, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did not garner enough votes at Monday night's caucuses to register any support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had moved to an early lead in preliminary sample results, but that evaporated when returns from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> began coming in. Later, however, he moved ahead again. Democratic state chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, said early Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had done `` one hell of a job in a state that is not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> country.'' In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were fighting it out for 45 national convention delegates and bragging rights to a victory on the eve of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses took on added importance because of the tight race for delegates that has developed between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> trailing. Republicans also held caucuses to begin the process of selecting 36 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Republican straw poll results suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was winning overwhelmingly. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to capture most of the Republian support here despite weekend appearances in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> by former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sigrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Freese </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, expected only 15,000 to 20,000 of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 570,301 registered Democrats to attend the caucuses. `` It depends on how good the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship basketball game is,'' she said of the Monday night game. At one caucus _ in Precinct 31, in Grand Junction _ the 21-member caucus solved that problem by recessing for 35 minutes to watch the game. The two Democratic front-runners campaigned in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> over the weekend, and both campaigns aired TV ads in hopes of attracting supporters to the caucuses in one-time candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s home state. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could land 15 to 20 delegates and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 15, with the remaining delegates either uncommitted or backing <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who was expected to attract support outside metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presented himself as the candidate of hope and invoked the memory of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose was assassinated 20 years ago. `` Hope has been unleashed,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd of church-goers Sunday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, endorsed by <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Saturday, continuing to sound his theme that he is `` a doer'' and `` not just a talker'' but avoiding direct criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Some political observers said the key to winning Democratic delegates was in the Hispanic community, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with his command of the Spanish language, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with his appeal to minorities, both hoped to fare well. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> says the outcome of future contests in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, which have large Hispanic populations, may depend on which candidate can win Hispanic voters here. Hispanics make up about 12 percent of the registered voters statewide. Blacks, expected to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, comprise 4 percent of registered Democrats.

 His governorship gone, his ailing auto dealership sold, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces a future in which one of the few certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial. But for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the future looks brighter without the shadow of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s embarrassing impeachment trial hanging over the state, said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who became governor with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s removal. `` Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat, said Monday. `` I know the decision made by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today was not reached lightly. It is time to put all that behind us and move forward.'' `` Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,'' she said. `` We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as Arizonans.'' The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his office Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and misusing the governor's protocol fund. The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose during <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the verdict was praised by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> opponents and condemned by supporters. Some legislators received police protection Monday night after getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. `` They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. He faces trial April 21 in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His brother <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> threw out an impeachment count based on the $ 350,000 loan issue. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not bar <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from holding public office again, his lawyer, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, indicated after the impeachment vote that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> may decide to bow out of politics. `` I think there is doubt,'' he said of whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would try to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17. It was not clear whether the ousted governor could remain on the recall ballot given him impeachment conviction. The matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said, `` I think the decision of where we go from now is dependent on whether or not the governor himself wants to stay in politics and that's something that he's got to decide overnight.'' After Monday's conviction, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, `` We'll decide tomorrow or the next day ... We're keeping all our options open.'' After he was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5, the 63-year-old <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> hinted he might give up politics. `` If I can be of service, fine,'' he said. `` If not, I'd enjoy private life. The best person does n't always win. Politics is not my favorite pastime.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> ran for governor five times before being elected in 1986. Although <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, testified last week that their <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> dealership in suburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> was thriving, he announced a day later that they'd been forced to sell it for $ 4 million because of dwindling sales. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said bad publicity surrounding his father's political battles had driven customers away The dealership was sold last week.

<HEAD>Mother and Children Died in Murder-Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deaths of a distraught Japanese-born woman and her two young daughters in a house fire was a type of Japanese murder-suicide intended to prevent the children from becoming orphans, police said. Physical evidence found at the home and interviews with the woman's husband led to that conclusion, Detective Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Haradon </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Mitsue </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON>, 28, was found Sunday in a bedroom along with her daughters, <PERSON> Seira </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Rina </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON>, 4. All three died of smoke inhalation, <PERSON> Haradon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitsue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON> had been having marital problems, the investigator said. The murder-suicide, known in Japanese as oyako shinju, is a tradition in which parents planning suicide feel obliged to kill their children so they will not be orphans. Mrs. <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON>, who moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, about eight years ago, and her husband, <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, were described by acquaintances as quiet and hard-working people. Mrs. <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON> worked at the <LOCATION> Mitsuyoshi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>. Her husband is head chef at the <LOCATION> Amagi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yoshikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Amagi </LOCATION> restaurant, said the couple met at his establishment about seven years ago when Mrs. <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON> worked there as a waitress. `` If she lost hope or something, she can not let the children live,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. `` I know of many cases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> like that.'' An estimated 300 cases of oyako shinju are reported each year in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, authorities said. The tragedy recalled the case of <PERSON> Fumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, a Japanese-born woman whose two young children died when she walked into the sea with them at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> in 1985. Her mother-child suicide attempt was carried out in shame over her husband's alleged adultery. Mrs. <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was placed on five years' probation. Although oyako shinju is illegal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, it is considered an honorable way to die and lingers in the culture, said <PERSON> Mamoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Iga </PERSON>, a professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION>, and author of `` The Thorn in the Chrysanthemum: Suicide and Economic Success in Modern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Iga </PERSON> said the crime is most often committed by mothers who have money problems or bad marriages.

<HEAD>Arbitrators Side With Smokey The Cat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of arbitrators has sided with <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> the cat, saying the owners of an office supply business were not negligent for keeping the feline in their store after it was accused of scratching a customer. News of the case prompted patrons of <ORGANIZATION> J.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weldin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and numerous others to contribute more than $ 2,000 to the defense fund of the 17-year-old, somewhat asthmatic cat. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> -RRB- is a star,'' said store manager <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who denied the cat attacked customer <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>. `` As long as he's living, he wo n't leave the store.'' At a hearing Monday attended by about 45 <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> supporters, a panel of three lawyers from the arbitration division of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the claims of Ms. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, 24, of suburban Upper Saint <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>. The arbitrators said they awarded no damages to Ms. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> because her attorney failed to prove damages or show <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> has a record of attacking customers. Ms. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> had been seeking an unspecified award for nominal damages, plus $ 1,500 in punitive damages and another $ 1,500 for her scars. Ms. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> `` came from nowhere'' and sank his front claws into her left wrist while she was making a purchase in October. She said she has a tiny scar and about a half-dozen pinprick marks on the back of her wrist. <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON>'s defense fund will be divided among the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> carved out a narrow lead over rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> early Tuesday as votes were counted in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s caucuses. Each of the front-runners had hoped for a solid win to provide `` bounce'' going into Tuesday's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary, but there was no clear winner when counting was called off for the night With 1,234 of 2,784 precincts reporting, or 44 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 46 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 40 percent. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> lagged far behind, with 4 percent, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was n't registering any support from the Monday night caucuses Late Monday, preliminary returns from a party sampling of 130 precincts gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 2-1 lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But when <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> precincts began weighing in with tallies early Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead disappeared in a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> surge. Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> battled his way back. The Democratic party quit counting for the night at about 4:30 a.m. EDT. The results were still too incomplete to determine conclusively how many national convention delegates each candidate won. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came under fire for his contact with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s involvement in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation a `` bad idea.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s correspondence with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but he blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being `` absolutely timid'' of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor dismissed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and his comments: `` I do n't know what he's serious about.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were joined by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaigning across <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is trailing badly in his effort to win here and keep his campaign alive, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> needs a good showing in the state to boost his faltering effort. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> urged voters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> to send a message Tuesday. `` We're not going to follow the pollsters; we're going to elect the man best qualified to be president,'' he said, quipping: `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> agrees with that too.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides emphasized how close the race is in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, speaker of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state assembly and a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` is going to win by enough _ three, four or five points.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runners in both states, awaited the slow dribble of results from the 2,784 precinct caucuses in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that will divide 45 national convention delegates. The Republicans were holding caucuses Monday night in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> as well as the Democrats. With Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already having locked up the nomination, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s effort to win some of the state's 36 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates was a symbolic gesture. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are the front-runners in the AP delegate count. Before the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> results were known, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 653.55 votes and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 646.55. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 381.8 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 169.5. A total of 468.6 were uncommitted. At the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July, 2,082 votes are needed to win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> again released his letter, along with a reply from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Monday. In his letter, the Panamanian dictator rejects <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s plea in a March 22 letter to leave the country. `` I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave. Today I reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s involvement in the turbulent Panamanian situation drew criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> likes to use to buy time,'' said State spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had talked Monday afternoon by telephone with high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the deputy secretary of state, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs _ and said they offered no disagreement with his appeal for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> that `` I think it's a bad idea for a private citizen to try to inject himself'' into a delicate international situation. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor added he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had acted out of good intentions. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had met with other foreign leaders _ such as <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Libyan strongman <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, though, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had never met with the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader. `` He did n't help matters in his meetings with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. `` I seriously doubt if he would help in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, for his part, would not join the chorus of criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do n't criticize someone who is not on the inside, so to speak, on how he feels he'd handle these things,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> saved his strongest criticism for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not hitting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> harder. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gives the impression of being scared to death'' to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and appears `` absolutely timid,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` That is the opposite of the bold leadership'' the nation needs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' actions are `` a subtle form of racism.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was clearly irritated by <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ought to start camaigning for the presidency,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, cutting off a reporter who sought to question him on the issue. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> lumped <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> together, saying neither `` has had as much as a single day in national government'' that would prepare them to be president. That criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was echoed by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat who declined to enter the 1988 Democratic presidential race. `` I just do n't think he has the experience, and I just disagree with him on some basic foreign policy and defense questions,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should not view opposition within the party as racist. `` I do n't think it should be deemed an insult or racist,'' he said. And he said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ca n't win the White House: `` If nominated, I do n't think there'd be much chance of winning.'' That view was echoed by former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` If he is nominated, it goes without saying he can not win. But everyone is overplaying the fact that he would be a liability because he is black,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is simply not true. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be a liability because his views are radical.'' There was good news on the fund-raising front for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who shocked even his own campaign by raising more than $ 2 million in March. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has run a low-budget campaign until now, will spend the money on advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s crucial April 19 primary.

<HEAD>Convicted Kidnapper Could Be `Marked Man' As Parole Ends</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Convicted kidnapper <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> will be a `` marked man'' if he decides to return to <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he was arrested for holding two boys captive eight years ago, a county official said. `` Let him go to some other state. Let him stay away from this county. There's still hard feelings here,'' <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimolino </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> is to be discharged from parole today, but that his office was not aware of any protest over the action. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, 56, was paroled to <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area after serving five years in prison for kidnapping <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, then 7, from <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> on Dec. 4, 1972, and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, then 5, from <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION> on Valentine's Day in 1980. Both boys were abducted while walking home from school. Although <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> regularly sexually abused him, charges of child abuse against <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> were dismissed in 1981 when a state appeals court said the statute of limitations had expired. Word of <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s release angered <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who said he ca n't forgive him During the trial, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> ordered him to call him `` Dad,'' renamed him <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> and told people <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> was his son throughout the eight years they roamed northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, living in trailer parks and motels. A psychologist testified during <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s trial that <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> had been brainwashed by <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> and for years was unable to attempt escape. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, now a 23-year-old college student and father of two, said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> remains a threat to children. `` I pity him for the sickness he has. I would n't trust him around any child of any age,'' said <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who hopes to become a police officer. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> said he escaped from <LOCATION> Parnell </LOCATION> on March 1, 1980, and hitchiked 40 miles with White to seek help from <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION> police to save the boy from sexual abuse. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> had kidnapped White two weeks earlier and held him in a one-room cabin in a remote area west of <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> was released from prison in 1985, former <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> expressed concern. `` There's no doubt in my mind he will do it again,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Echols </PERSON>, a Colorado-based author who wrote an NBC_TV mini-steries about the <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> case, said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> told him six months ago that he planned to move to <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> when his parole expired. His parole conditions had required him to stay in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, attend weekly therapy sessions and stay away from children. He also was prohibited from traveling through <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> or Merced counties. `` He's a free man, of course,'' <PERSON> Cimolino </PERSON> said. `` We're powerless to do anything about where he goes. But if he comes to <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>, I think he'll be a marked man.'' <PERSON> Echols </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, a former hotel clerk and drifter, has lived in a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> boarding house since 1985, working as a short-order cook and dishwasher between bouts of unemployment. `` People have yet to forget what took place,'' said <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochester </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s undersheriff. `` And yet ... unless he breaks a law, there's not much we can do about it.'' The county opposed <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s three-year parole to that area when, because of good behavior and work credits, he was released from prison after serving five years of his concurrent eight-year, eight-month sentences for his two kidnapping convictions.

<HEAD>Dukakis Ahead in Colorado Caucuses, Awaits Today's Wisconsin Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, fresh from a flurry of campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, was optimistic about the outcome of today's Democratic presidential primary in that state as he returned to his home base. `` We worked hard,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said shortly after his chartered jet landed at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> just before midnight Monday. `` It looks good,'' he said of his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> campaign, `` but you never know until the votes come in.'' Early today, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were still dueling furiously for a first-place finish in Monday night's <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses. Early returns put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> well ahead, but the race narrowed dramatically in the wee hours of the morning as <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> returns began coming in. When the Democratic party finished counting for the night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but fewer than half the precincts were in, and counting was not to resume until late this afternoon. Before he left <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised in a speech in <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> that he would avoid criticism of rival <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I've been in politics for 25 years and this is the first time I've been attacked for not attacking somebody else,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> before a crowd of 2,000. That was in reference to another Democratic contender, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. lbert <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, repeatedly blasting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being too `` timid'' about taking on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said he believes that either he or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have a `` substantial lead'' in delegates by the end of the primary season in June. In his final <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> appearance before heading home, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told supporters that every vote counts. `` When you go home tonight, make a few phone calls, get a hold of your neighbors. Believe me, your work will make the ... difference,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is a very tight race. It's a very competitive race,'' he said. After <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> left the state, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> told a reporter he believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would come out the winner in today's presidential preference primary. `` The independent, the -LRB- Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> voters are turning his way,'' said <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, has trailed far behind front-runners <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in pre-election polls, as has <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> because he was too loyal to some aides and disregarded advice from politicians who could have helped him, both supporters and opponents say. But some observers were more critical of the first-term governor, who was convicted by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` Here's a guy who was going to clean up state government because it was too corrupt, and he brings in a whole legion of people who are accused in various sorts of ways of being corrupt, and some are facing trial now,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> exhibited `` a pattern of behavior that is given to deceit as standard operating procedure,'' added Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>. Still others said the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor failed to build support, apparently forgetting that he won the governorship with only 40 percent of the vote in a three-way race. `` You've got to understand that here was a man who was elected essentially without the press and without the -LRB- Republican -RRB- party. ... What he forgot was that he could n't survive without them,'' said former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who resigned to face an extortion charge for allegedly trying to influence a <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member's vote. Even <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers did not agree with his claim that he was a victim of a conspiracy by legislators and others in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> establishment, such as Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> insisted on making <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a loyal backer, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> despite strong opposition from many legislators. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> eventually admitted that he told the governor an alleged death threat by DOA aide <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was `` a lot of hot air'' and would go away. On Monday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted of obstructing a state investigation of the alleged death threat, one of two impeachment articles that led to his removal. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> himself was allowed to stay on for a while after allegedly making the threat and after a decades-old youthful robbery conviction came to light. In addition, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> ignored advice from his chief of staff, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON>, who said it would be politically unwise to loan $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund to <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. On the basis of that loan, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was also convicted Monday of misusing state funds. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON>, a Republican who generally has supported the governor, said he believed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s problems stemmed more from `` perception of his inability to make a good chief executive officer for the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> than ... whether he committed any crimes.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s relations with the media and the Legislature were often stormy, spurred on by his `` continual ability to undermine his own credibility by silly or stupid statements,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican. <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, also a Republican, cited the governor's claim in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> testimony _ retracted a day later _ that the former head of his security detail had stolen a report from <PERSON> Colter </PERSON>'s desk. Former governor and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fannin </PERSON> was a member of a group of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> `` elder statesmen'' formed last summer to help <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> with his troubles. <PERSON> Fannin </PERSON> said he advised the governor to try harder to get along with the media and the Legislature. `` But he's very stubborn and determined in his ways.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> contended, however, that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> were really no worse than those of his predecessor, Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>

 Several players in a national desegregation drama will return to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> to mark the 25th anniversary of the day then-Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> tried to block the entrance of two black students. To commemorate the event June 11 _ a milestone in the civil rights struggle _ the university will host a three-day symposium called `` Opening Doors,'' featuring some of the nation's leading scholars on race relations. The university `` felt the best way to recognize this event was through a symposium that focuses not only on the history of race relations, the stand in the door, but also the present and future of race relations,'' said Professor <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who is writing a book on that era. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopke </PERSON>, a university official helping to arrange the symposium, said they believe the school was an unwilling pawn in power plays between <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and the administration of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` The university had a very substantive, productive plan for integrating,'' <PERSON> Knopke </PERSON> said. `` In the late 1950s and early 1960s the administration and others were looking seriously at ways to integrate. There was a plan already in place for doing that when <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> started speaking. `` The university was just in the middle of it.'' Among those who have agreed to take part in the symposium, which will end June 11, is <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenbach </PERSON>, who as assistant attorney general faced off with <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> in the doorway of Foster Auditorium, a few hours before students <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> walked in to register. Also agreeing to take part are <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, now Mrs. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, president of the university at the time; then-Dean <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMaistre </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> businessman who organized community support for the school's desegregation. `` We wanted to bring back some of the individuals who were involved in the <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> stand to share their perspectives,'' <PERSON> Knopke </PERSON> said. `` We want to make something positive out of it, something productive and informative.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., was invited to represent his slain brothers, the president and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was attorney general in 1963, but he said he had another commitment <PERSON> Knopke </PERSON> said he doubted that <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who has been in poor health, will be able to attend, but that documentary footage of the governor's stand will be shown. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> has said he made his stand to reduce the possibility of violence at the university, although critics said it increased tensions. An array of scholars will present papers dealing with race relations today and what can be expected in the future, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` There is always in the minds of Alabamians the fact that 25 years later we are far different than in 1963, yet we still sometimes get in our minds that we're frozen in 1963,'' he said. `` What happened then is history and we're a far different people than we were then.'' The school-door standoff, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, `` was a test of wills between <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration, the state of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and federal authorities.'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, he said, has since acknowledged that he made `` a terrible public relations mistake.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the university, with 10 percent black enrollment today, `` is so long past all that in the actual workings of this institution and carrying out its mission that sometimes we have to pinch ourselves to see if that were really us and if it were, what does it have to do with us now.'' That, he said, is the purpose of the symposium.

<HEAD>Sources in Syria Report Possible Release of Three French Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A deal has been struck under which <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will resume diplomatic relations and three Frenchmen held by a pro-Iranian group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be released, two sources in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said today. If there are no last-minute snags, the release could come `` in the next few days,'' one of the sources said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would not comment on the report. British and Lebanese newspapers also have reported that representatives of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been meeting secretly to work out a hostage deal. The two sources in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> declined to be identified but have proved reliable on hostage matters in the past. They said a special envoy of the French government spent two days negotiating with the hostage takers in their stronghold in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The sources said the envoy, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefani </PERSON>, an associate of French Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, and an unidentified Lebanese businessman, returned to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday through a checkpoint on the Lebanese-Syrian border controlled by the Syrian army. The sources said <PERSON> Stefani </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> businessman were involved in previous negotiations which led to the release Nov. 27, 1987, of two French hostages. The three French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, 42, a journalist taken May 22, 1985, and two diplomats, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, 63, and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 46, both seized March 22, 1985. The kidnappings were claimed by Islamic Jihad or Islamic Holy War, a group of Moslems of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Moslem militants claimed in March 1985 that they killed a fourth French hostage, researcher <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, but no body has been found. Shiite militants loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are believed to hold most of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The longest held hostage is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The two Frenchmen released last November were <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>, 34, a lighting engineer for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Antenne-2 television, who was kidnapped March 8, 1986, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON>, 31, a free-lance photographer kidnapped Jan. 13, 1987. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in July 1987 in a dispute over an employee of the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who refused to give evidence to a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> court on terrorist incidents. The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily As-Safir on March 31 reported progress in `` secret negotiations'' to free the three hostages. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified French intelligence sources, reported Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are close to sealing a hostage deal. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> released a terrorist suspect, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohajer </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite, on March 24. It cited insufficient evidence to hold him for involvement in a series of 1986 bombings. Officials denied at the time the release had anything to do with the hostage negotiations.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is trying to deport a Latvian accused of collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in a case described by one federal official as so strong `` I would not want to be defending it.'' <PERSON> Konrads </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1959 saying he was a farmer in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. What he failed to disclose, the government maintains, is that he belonged to a pro-Nazi police unit in World War II that killed Jews by the thousands. `` Its main task was essentially rounding people up, guarding them and killing them,'' said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on the Holocaust. <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> was the government's main witness Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> opened deportation hearings. The government said it has evidence that <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> was a commander in the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, whose leader was convicted in 1979 of the murders of at least 13,000 people from 1941-44. In 1985 the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed for <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON>' deportation, saying he lied on his entrance visa and would not have been admitted to this country if officials had known about his past. The government's case is expected to last several weeks. During that time, attorneys plan to summon witnesses who survived the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> death camps and present documents detailing the actions of <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> and the unit. <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON>, 74, of <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> had little to say during proceedings Monday. He stared straight ahead as <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> testified, occasionally chewing gum and whispering to his attorney, <PERSON> Ivars </PERSON> <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON>. As he stepped onto an elevator, <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> was asked for comment and replied, `` Good morning. That's all my comment.'' <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON> also refused to discuss the case. `` This is one of the strongest cases I have witnessed,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON>, deputy litigation director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Nazi-hunting arm. `` This case involves some very powerful evidence. I would not want to be defending it.'' During the first day of testimony before Immigration Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON>, government attorney <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> <PERSON> Golberg </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> to describe the German invasion of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the formation of the police unit in charge of killing Jews. <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, the author of the book `` The Destruction of the European Jews,'' said the Latvian Security Auxiliary Police was formed shortly after German troops seized control of the country from the Soviets. The security police was comprised mostly of Latvians who admired <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and welcomed the German invasion. `` Some of them wanted action, wanted to be associated with power,'' he said. `` There was also promise here of compensation.'' Asked if members volunteered, <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> replied, `` Absolutely.'' `` Anyone with scruples would obviously not volunteer without realizing what was going on,'' he said. <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> was denied bond when the deportation charge was filed in spring 1985, but he was later released on $ 750,000 bond. <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON>, a citizen of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, would have the choice of country if he is deported, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. If a country refused to admit him, the government would make a recommendation. <PERSON> Kalejs </PERSON> owns property in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Colorado Democratic Caucuses Stir Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At one <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> neighborhood caucus, Democrats split their county convention delegates between <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after the state party chairman and a prominent state senator took opposite sides. At a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucus not far away, Republicans went for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a straw poll, except for one diehard supporter for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who has dropped out of the race. At a Grand Junction Democratic caucus, a timeout was called so participants could watch the final minutes of the <LOCATION> Kansas-Oklahoma </LOCATION> game for the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball championship. And at the executive mansion of Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, where another Democratic precinct caucus was held, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the 2-to-1 favorite. At 2,784 Democratic caucuses and the same number of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood gatherings across <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Monday night, Coloradans took the first step in choosing delegates to their national party conventions this summer. The spotlight was on Democrats because of the tight Jackson-Dukakis race and because the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses could give one of the candidates momentum going into today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. At stake were 45 of the state's 51 Democratic delegates to the national convention. The interest level was reflected by turnout, which was considered good at Democratic caucuses and thin at <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gatherings, party officials said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to capture most of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 36 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the Republican National Convention, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials were wary of an ambush by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who spent three days in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Easter weekend. The ambush failed to materialize in early returns. State Democratic chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Groff </PERSON>, a black state senator from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, took opposite sides at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s Precinct 822, with <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> endorsing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Groff </PERSON> urging support for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, who is one of six <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> `` super delegates'' to the national convention and already committed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> not only has governed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> well, but `` I believe <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can win.'' <PERSON> Groff </PERSON>, known for his fiery rhetoric, said he had been a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter until recently, when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s message persuaded him to switch sides. `` His message is an American message,'' said <PERSON> Groff </PERSON>. `` He speaks to all Americans.'' Four of the precincts seven delegates were sent to the county convention committed to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and three to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus in Precinct 623 of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept a straw poll, 17-1. `` All year long, Precinct 623 has been a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> precinct, and there was one diehard vote for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tonight,'' said caucus chairperson <PERSON> Evamarie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Precinct 637, the executive mansion on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> _ who already has endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and will go to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a super delegate _ saw his precinct send six delegates to the county convention committed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and three for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Tonight, we're all equal,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said prior to his remarks in support of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` and this party thrives on good competitive issues. I have the highest respect for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. But I think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the best qualified _ and the most electable.'' At another Democratic precinct caucus on <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Precinct 621A, the delegates were split 3-3 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with one delegate uncommitted. `` I want to throw the rascals out and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s the man,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter and a delegate to the county convention. Democrats in Precinct 31 in north Grand Junction heard a spirited debate between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters before recessing for 35 minutes to watch the final 2 minutes and 11 seconds of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship basketball game. Then, the caucus decided to send four <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates, three uncommitted delegates and one <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate to the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> convention. When precinct chairman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> tried to resume discussions with seven seconds left in the game, one Democrat said, `` Get the basketball game over with. Let's get our priorities straight.''

<HEAD>Compromise To Create Second Judgeship in Robeson County</HEAD>

 Lawmakers agreed to support a second <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship for racially tense <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, eliminating the need for a special legislative session sought by supporters of a slain Indian judicial candidate. Monday's agreement came during a three-hour meeting in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> between Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> legislators and members of the campaign committee of <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who was killed March 26 in what police called a domestic dispute. If approved by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in its June session, Republican Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> could appoint a new <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge from <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he supported the agreement and pledged he would appoint a minority, and probably an Indian. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s supporters had pressured the governor to call a special legislative session to amend state law to allow another minority candidate to run for the present judgeship. Filing for the judgeship closed in February, and state law does not allow a replacement for a candidate who dies more than 30 days after the filing period ends. The judgeship was one of nine established last year in areas with predominantly black or Indian populations in an effort to increase the number of minority judges. Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Locks </PERSON>, a black <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> leader who was part of Monday's negotiations, was unenthusiastic about the compromise. `` But we were trying to find some way to diffuse the kinds of problems we currently have in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, one of the state's most powerful Democrats, said the agreement could help ease racial tensions in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I think it certainly can do wonders, at least for the feelings they have about the justice system,'' he said. The proposal also would virtually assure that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s district attorney, will be elected <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge this fall. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a Lumbee Indian leader in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s only opposition for the special judgeship created last year. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> is white. Also on Monday, about 600 people gathered in the place where <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> started his campaign for judge three months ago to pledge to continue his struggle for change. `` We must keep the faith. We must not let tragedy keep us down. We must press on,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>. Many Lumbees and blacks in the county say they are discriminated against and that they are not represented adequately in local political offices. The county's population is 37 percent Indian, 37 percent white and 26 percent black. The tension was dramatized Feb. 1, when two armed <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> burst into The Robesonian newspaper in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> and took at least 17 people hostage. No one was injured.

<TEXT>
 Hooded gunmen in army uniforms surrounded and fired on about 500 people at an Easter festival in a village plaza, killing 33 and wounding eight, a survivor said. `` The one in charge shouted ` Kill everyone you can!''' said the survivor, <PERSON> Segundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, in an interview Monday with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> said he counted the dead and wounded in the Sunday massacre in the small village of <LOCATION> Mejor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Esquina </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, 280 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital. He said a brother, two nephews and a cousin of his were among the dead. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> said there were 10 to 15 attackers. `` They just shot at everybody, at those who were dancing and those who tried to run away. They made a lot of the people lie down on the ground and then shot them in the head,'' he said. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> said men, women, old people and children were among the victims. Right-wing death squads in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> often wear hoods and army uniforms. The village of 600, in <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> state, was celebrating the end of Holy Week. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Llorente </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the mayor of the nearby town of <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION>, said earlier that about 10 men arrived in vehicles Sunday night at <ORGANIZATION> Mejor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esquina </ORGANIZATION>. He had heard that 28 people were killed. <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said in a broadcast interview with <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> that the police told him they did not know who attacked the townspeople. There are more than a dozen right-wing death squads in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mejor </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquina </PERSON> is in the heart of a mountainous area where a left-wing guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, has been organizing lately. Sunday's attack was the second massacre in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in a month.

 The ouster of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination 20 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Monday at the awards dinner that night. About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights anthem, `` We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background. `` I hate to rejoice,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said, `` but I feel good about this ... We did overcome. Justice has been served.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office 20 years to the day that <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, an aide to King and an ordained Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse: `` Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. In <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, meanwhile, where <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> grew up, his removal from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances. `` It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin Ona Rust of <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION>. `` I'm very disappointed in the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Altamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1942 and moved away after joining the service in 1943. He is scheduled to address the high school's commencement ceremony May 27. A former classmate, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieldsted </PERSON>, who was one year behind <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in high school, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s removal must stem from a misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> canceled a King holiday for state workers on Jan. 12, 1987, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock groups. He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with official actions or offhand remarks. Among other things, he defended the use of the word `` pickaninny'' for black children. `` I think Gov. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of spirit,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think it had to be a corruption of spirit in order to insult <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and the birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.'' King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, stood thoughtfully after being told of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment, and declined to comment.

 The federal trial of three white supremacist leaders and six other men accused of plotting to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government through violence has gone to the jury. `` It's all in Yahweh's hands,'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, wife of supremacist leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said after the jury began deliberations Monday. `` If the truth is known, they'll be acquitted.'' <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON> is a Hebrew name for God. The jury was to resume deliberations today. The case involves 13 defendants, nine of whom are charged with seditious conspiracy, or conspiring to overthrow the government. A conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. In addition, five of the defendants are accused of conspiring to kill federal officials and two are charged with interstate transportation of stolen money. The maximum penalty for murder conspiracy is life in prison. The stiffest punishment for transporting stolen money is 10 years. Five of the defendants are in prison for other crimes. In addition to <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the supremacist leaders are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 70 of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Miles, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, is the author of a newsletter that attacked Jews and the federal government. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is the founder of the white supremacist group <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> is a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> recruiter who left the <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and became a representative for the Aryan Nations. The government alleged that the defendants agreed to try to bring down the government by force during an Aryan Nations congress in 1983. The government contended that some of the defendants went on to commit a series of robberies to finance their activities. The robberies netted about $ 4.1 million, of which about $ 1 million is unaccounted for, the government said. In closing arguments Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> came up with the idea for overthrowing the government. <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said the sedition defendants maintained they hoped to bring about a white supremacist nation through a peaceful move to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. But, he said, if that was the case, why did: _ Defendant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> say in a taped conversation that he needed to bomb some major telephone facility _ Defendant <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> become a member of The Order, a violent group that committed armed robberies, by taking an oath declaring a `` full state of war'' _ The Covenant, The Sword and The Arm of The Lord _ an Arkansas-based supremacist group _ collect an arsenal of automatic weapons, silencers, grenades and other explosives and embark on robberies, bombings and murders During the trial, the defense attacked the credibility of government witnesses. But <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> told jurors, `` Plots made in hell do n't have angels as partners.'' Attorney <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deday </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRene </PERSON>, representing Miles, said in his closing argument Monday that the government's key witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, `` had serious delusions.'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> belonged to the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> group. <PERSON> LaRene </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> made up the story about a conspiracy hatched at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> because he lost an appeal of his racketeering conviction and was looking for a way out of prison. The defense attorney said that in three earlier reports about supremacist activities, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> never mentioned that alleged meeting.

 An <ORGANIZATION> ex-Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive claims the defense contractor sought help from a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> prince and friends of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> 3rd in an attempt to sell military equipment to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries. But negotiations to sell bridge pontoons and other supplies to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> eventually fell through, former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified Monday. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, one of four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials testifying at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and six others in exchange for leniency, was asked about the scandal-plagued company's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> dealings in his 14th day on the witness stand. The jury was not present during the questioning and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> later ruled the topic inadmissible because, she said, it did n't provide any evidence that a crime had been committed but would unduly prejudice the jury. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and the six others are charged with turning the now-bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes. Once a small machine shop in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> grew into a multimillion-dollar manufacturer through a program that set aside federal contracts without competitive bidding for minority-owned companies. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and others helped <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> falsely portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the no-bid program. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> denied that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> had acted on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` No, we were acting as <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, one of four ex-Wedtech executives to plead guilty to state and federal corruption charges. `` We believed we could do it legally.'' `` You knew you could never legally have gotten an export license -LRB- to sell military equipment -RRB-?'' asked defense attorney <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorosa </PERSON>. `` It crossed my mind,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who did not elaborate. Asked if <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s close friend and former business associate, had said he could help obtain export licenses, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> replied, `` It never got to that point.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> previously testified that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> $ 800,000 for his `` influence with <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been accused of wrongdoing in the case. The witness said company officials spoke with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` on two or three occasions'' about foreign deals. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also said a former <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> financial adviser, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, was `` a conduit in trying to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguedas </PERSON>, when called for comment, said, `` I've never heard this allegation before, and I continue to deny that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> has engaged in any illegal conduct.'' Both <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> are under federal indictment, accused of extracting payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly influencing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other officials.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called an aid package the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved last week for the Contra rebels illegal. His comments came Monday, one day before the third round of talks between military leaders for the leftist government and the Contra rebels aimed at working out the technical details of the 60-day cease-fire that began Friday. In another development, reports reaching <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> indicated that some fighting between <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> and Contras has occurred despite the truce. `` We can not accept any type of aid to the Contras because it would be legitimizing the interventionist policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters. `` It is illegal because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no right to decide what type of government <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ought to have.'' Under a 60-day cease-fire agreement signed March 23 in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, the Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they would grant freedom of expression and amnesty to political prisoners and will allow rebel leaders to take part in national talks. In today's technical talks, also to be held in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> representatives will hammer out technical details of the truce. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday signed the aid package for the rebels and victims of the fighting that has battered <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for more than six years. Only $ 17.7 million of the $ 48 million package was directed to the rebels, and the aid package contains no provision for weapons. Despite the cease-fire, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, an underground rebel station, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> on Monday as saying that Sandinista troops had been firing on rebels. A transcript of the broadcast also quoted Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> continued bombing civilian towns in the rural north. The pro-government newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, reported that Contra forces attacked a Sandinista army patrol Saturday, killing two soldiers and injuring three near the town of <LOCATION> Condega </LOCATION>, about 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said there were no reports of cease-fire violations. The cease-fire was arranged to give both sides time to work out a permanent truce in the war, which has killed more than 40,000 people. Under the peace plan, the rebels are to gather in cease-fire zones during the first two weeks of April. Two days of meetings last week ended with both sides agreeing only to set up five cease-fire zones. They failed to work out the size of the areas or security for the Contras. The peace agreement does not mention disarming the rebels, and the Contras claim they will never surrender their weapons. The <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> met the first step of the agreement by releasing 100 political prisoners March 27. The remaining 3,300 political prisoners are to be released gradually as the terms of the pact are met. The Contras charge the Sandinistas only released 10 political prisoners that they requested. They say the others served only a few weeks or were common criminals. The Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> initially, but in 1981 began financing the Contras.

<TEXT>
 A leading government-owned newspaper today criticized <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories for boycotting Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s efforts for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. `` We would have preferred if they -LRB- Palestinian leaders -RRB- revised their continued boycott and tried to give a chance for a dialogue with the American side,'' an editorial in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> began talks with Palestinians last month when he met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> professors <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON>, who belong to the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> movement to establish a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory. It said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s shuttle visits `` to the parties of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict -LRB- are -RRB- ... indications of the seriousness of -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration to reach a final settlemenmt of the region's problem.'' `` It is true that the American initiative does not meet all the desires of the Arab side in general and the Palestinians in particular, but this does not mean it is devoid of any positive elements that could be built on and promoted during the dialogue,'' the newspaper said. It said the initiative has for the first time recognized the right of the Palestinians for self-rule and called this a `` turning point in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan calls for three years of self-rule, but not statehood, for the 1.5 million Palestinians living in the occupied territories. Negotiations on an overall settlement would open in December. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 Talks began today on the future of the last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military garrisons in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator said the outcome will affect U.S.-Philippine relations and regional security. `` The significant Soviet presence in the immediate area casts a shadow over expanding economic activity throughout the region,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, head of the 10-member American panel, said in opening remarks. The review of a 41-year-old agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> comes amid a growing clamor by many Filipinos for phasing out the garrisons, which they see as a vestige of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonialism. About 500 people marched this afternoon from the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> chanting slogans demanding the bases be closed. Police stood guard in front of the embassy compound but there were no incidents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials described the opening session as cordial. `` Both sides expressed their desire for a successful review and pledged to work toward this end in a harmonious, business-like manner,'' the two panels said in a joint statement. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, chief Filipino negotiator, has called for substantial increases in the $ 180 million which <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> receives annually for use of the six installations. Filipino officials say they will also press <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for details of nuclear weapons that may be stored there and for expanding the right to try American troops charged with criminal offenses. The outcome of the talks, expected to last three months, will determine whether the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> allows the bases to remain in the nation after their lease expires in 1991. Under a new Filipino Constitution, a lease extension must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> has refused to say whether <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will agree to a major increase in lease payments. Last month, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments of $ 1.2 billion for the bases. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> noted today the presence of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops enables the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to spend scarce resources on economic development instead of defense. `` An overnight shift in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intentions can transform this presence into a serious economic and military threat to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the region,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. He said the talks `` will lay the groundwork to create a positive atmosphere for discussions to come later on the future of our security relations.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' chief weapons supplier in the government's 19-year-old fight against communist rebels. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. About 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers are stationed at the bases, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says are crucial for defense of the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The bases are officially under Filipino command but are effectively controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has promised to let the bases remain until 1991 but has refused to say whether she supports an extension. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say 40 percent of the warships that call at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> are nuclear-powered.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s portrayal of a manic ghost in `` Beetlejuice'' had enough magic to take the top box office position from `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' while `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' took third place. The Easter weekend box office take was also a spring bonanza for studios suffering through the winter moviegoing doldrums. `` Beetlejuice'' rung in more than $ 8 million for the No. 1 position. In doing so, it knocked `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s nostalgic look at 1945 Army life, down a notch. The <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> yarn, starring <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> as a boot camp private, made its debut at No. 1 a week earlier Its $ 6 million take put it in second place.

The Disney studios, leading the box office derby for months with the blockbuster hits `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` Three Men and a Baby,'' snagged three spots in the Top 10 this week. The studio's reissue of `` The Fox And The Hound'' took in $ 4 million for a two-week gross of almost $ 12 million and the No. 4 spot in the turnstile race. The frightful coming of the Apocalypse in `` The Seventh Sign,'' starring <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, was fifth with $ 3.76 million, and the college football recruiting farce `` Johnny Be Good'' was sixth with $ 2.9 million. Moviegoers shelled out $ 2.8 million to catch <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON>'s Oscar-nominated performance as an irreverent <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> disc jockey in `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' putting it in seventh place `` Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach'' was eighth with a $ 2.2 million take, `` A New Life'' was ninth with $ 1.5 million and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` D.O.A.'' was 10th with $ 1.4 million. Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release and estimated production costs when available. 1. `` Beetlejuice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 8.03 million, 1,000 screens, $ 3,030 per screen, $ 10.45 million, one week -LRB- released Wednesday -RRB-, n-a. 2. `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' Universal, $ 6.01 million, 1,329 screens, $ 4,525 per screen, $ 16.37 million, two weeks, $ 16 million. 3. `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5.12 million, 1,196 screens, $ 4,286 per screen, $ 5.12 million, n-a. 4. `` The Fox And The Hound,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.01 million, 1,567 screens, $ 2,561 per screen, $ 11.49 million, two weeks -LRB- re-release -RRB-, $ 4.8 million. 5. `` The Seventh Sign,'' Tristar, $ 3.76 million, 1,256 screens, $ 3,000 per screen, $ 3.76 million, one week, n-a. 6. `` Johnny Be Good,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.94 million, 1,194 screens, $ 2,440 per screen, $ 10.26 million, two weeks, $ 8 million. 7. `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' Disney, $ 2.80 million, 1,412 screens, $ 1,986 per screen, $ 105.38 million, 15 weeks, $ 21 million. 8. `` Police Academy 5: Assignment <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.29 million, 1,633 screens, $ 1,404 per screen, $ 14.82 million, three weeks, $ 9 million. 9. `` A New Life,'' Paramount, $ 1.57 million, 796 screens, $ 1,982 per screen, $ 5.05 million, two weeks, $ 18 million. 10. `` D.O.A.,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.44 million, 869 screens, $ 1,661 per screen, $ 10.02 million, three weeks, $ 12 million.

 Burnt by a controversial services tax last year, state lawmakers and Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> say they wo n't be talking taxes during the 1988 legislative session opening today. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> came under heavy fire for his original support and later flip-flop on the services tax, which would have raised $ 1 billion by taxing lawyers, lawn care, accounting and other services. The unusual 5 percent levy was repealed in December after much argument. The controversy was fueled by the state's plan to tax services such as advertising across state lines. Publishers, broadcasters and the hotel industry raised an outcry, and many groups threatened to cancel <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> conventions before <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> backed off and pushed for alternatives. `` It'll be very helpful to talk about problems and not have that all-consuming issue,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Monday. The first-term Republican wo n't have to look far for other concerns. Shackled by budget and political restraints, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s leaders face overcrowded prisons, congested highways and schools, and an environment buckling under the pressure of 1,000 new residents each day `` It will be a real competition for funds this year,'' said Education Commissioner <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Castor </PERSON>, who wants nearly $ 1 billion in additional appropriations to meet her department's needs in the face of 67,000 new students in 1988-89. The state relies heavily on its sales tax on goods, which the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> increased by one percentage point to 6 percent after it repealed the services tax. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he has n't found any of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues or conservative Democrats in favor of new taxes this year. `` Maybe it's one of those situations where it's going to have to get a lot worse before it gets better,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, a Democrat, said Monday at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> TaxWatch annual meeting. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said his travels around the state have convinced him that citizens do n't want new taxes regardless of the ramifications of not raising more revenue.

 Suspected Sikh militants today killed a senior member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after he organized protests against <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> violence, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency said <PERSON> Vilayati </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Katyal </PERSON> and his bodyguard were killed by three suspected Sikh militants in the town of <LOCATION> Kanpur </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Katyal </PERSON>, 53, was a member of the Uttar Pradesh state legislature. <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said he was targeted by the militants for organizing a strike in <LOCATION> Kanpur </LOCATION> to protest of killings in nearby <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, where the militants are most active. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, three Sikhs were killed in separate attacks Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. The killings raise to 659 the number of people killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year in the Sikh guerrilla war for a separate homeland.

<TEXT>
 Federal prosecutors have challenged the legality of millionaire <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s sentence on tax-fraud charges, which involves a $ 3 million contribution to the homeless instead of a prison term. `` Laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be, we submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of justice, and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for liberty while the poor can not,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said in a motion filed Monday. `` Sadly, we are compelled to observe that this sentence is illegal,'' the prosecutor said of the unusual punishment imposed Feb. 12 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>. `` The law does not allow an exchange of money for jail time even for the benefit of a badly needed societal purpose.'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said Monday he would have no comment on the motion and was awaiting a response by <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s attorneys. After <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest to 10 tax fraud counts for inflating the value of land donated to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> ordered the industrialist to perform a $ 3 million project to aid the homeless in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and to pay $ 4 million in back taxes, penalties and interest. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>, who also ruled <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> could not take a tax deduction for the donation to the homeless and could not file for voluntary bankruptcy, acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its legality might be questioned. `` If for some reason -LRB- the sentence -RRB- is ever challenged, this court will, in fact, incarcerate <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>,'' he said in February. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>'s five-page motion noted that <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> would go to prison if any of the sentencing conditions were violated but `` did not indicate what -LRB- the -RRB- sentence would otherwise have been.'' In his motion, <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said he was `` duty-bound to call to this court's attention the fact that this court does not have the power to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a condition of probation.'' A hearing on <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s plan for distribution of the $ 3 million was set for Wednesday before <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s inland provinces indicated today they are scrambling for development strategies of their own now that the central government's emphasis is on building up the coastal areas. Delegates from one western region suggested the first joint ventures in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since a bitter 1960 political split. `` If the coastal policies are only looking to exports, how are we in the west going to modernize?'' wondered <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baozhang </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Xinjiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uygur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, at a meeting of the region's delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The congress, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, began a 20-day annual session March 25. Foreign reporters were allowed today for the second time to sit in on delegate discussion groups in the Great Hall of the People. Many inland officials oppose the state's new strategy of developing the coast into an export-producing center, fearing their already backward regions will stay mired in poverty while the coast becomes rich. However, coastal development is a pet project of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said his solution for <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> was to increase inland trade across the border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, making <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> into an export center of its own. <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Tomur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawamat </PERSON>, invited the Soviets to enter into joint ventures in his region. The Soviets have not had joint ventures in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the 1960 political split between the two Communist giants. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> then called home thousands of technicians and industrial experts who had been helping rebuild <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy from the devastation of World War II. Although political differences remain strong, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have concluded several trade agreements in recent years, and an unofficial cross-border trade flourishes in <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> and other remote regions. Last month, the two countries announced plans to turn a hotel in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into a joint venture. `` We and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people have the same hope, although we have great political differences,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said. `` The people of both countries hope to carry out many economic exchanges. We need some Soviet products and they need some of ours. Both nations could benefit.'' Delegates from <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province, which borders the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, pressed similar proposals and won support from <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuobin </PERSON>, minister of foreign economic relations and trade. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> as saying trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries will increase rapidly, and that provinces will be allowed to make some trade arrangements directly without going through the central government.

 Israeli troops surrounded Arab guerrillas trying to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and attacked them at dawn's first light today, the army said. Two guerrillas were killed and four soldiers were wounded. It was ninth penetration or attempted infiltration of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in four and a half months, since a guerrilla on a hangglider coasted into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and killed six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers before being shot to death. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, claimed responsibility for today's attempt. The radio said the guerrillas apparently intended to take <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians as hostages. The army said troops initially spotted a band of guerrillas just yards from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border near <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yuval </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shmona </LOCATION>. `` The patrol opened fire at the terrorists who returned the fire and threw grenades,'' an army spokesman said. `` The army surrounded the band and, at first light of morning, attacked them.'' The statement from the army did not say how many guerrillas were involved or if any were captured or escaped. It said the guerrillas intended to `` carry out a deadly attack.'' The army said three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers suffered minor wounds and a fourth was more seriously injured. The statement said troops found Kalishnikov rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and dozens of hand grenades on the bodies of the two. The Israeli military censor prevented publication of news of the attempted infiltration for several hours. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said a three-hour Israeli search operation began around 2 a.m. `` There were a lot of ground soldiers.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for a former state senator claimed he was suffering from the effects of being drugged and tortured when he made statements to authorities on his return to this country from foreign custody. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, who disappeared just before he was to go to prison on a kickback conviction and spent two years on the lam, was treated so badly by authorities in the <LOCATION> Maldive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> that he began hallucinating the night before he was turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the attorneys say. `` Mr. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> hallucinated that the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> told him to convert and he would be released,'' said a motion filed by the lawyers last week. The motion, filed Thursday before Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>, seeks to suppress statements <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> made to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents en route from the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> islands to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1987. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> does not remember being read his rights or waiving his rights to an attorney during the flight, the motion said. It also said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents manipulated <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> to obtain the statements. Defense attorneys also filed motions last week to dismiss 35 of the 90 counts in a federal indictment charging <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> with masterminding a $ 20 million swindle of a pension fund. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, 50, is scheduled to go on trial Sept. 7 on charges he set up a bogus mortgage company in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to bilk the pension fund of Teamsters Local 701 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>. Court documents do not indicate the nature of the statements <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> allegedly made to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Marshal <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Deem </PERSON> and Special Agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommero </PERSON> during the flight. First Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> declined comment on the statements Monday but said they may be made public during a May 13 pretrial hearing before <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> faked his death in a bogus scuba-diving accident in September 1985, weeks before he was to be sentenced for a 1980 kickback conviction involving the same pension fund. An indictment alleges <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, a disbarred attorney, engineered the second scam while working as a government informant. In 26 months on the lam, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> traveled through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> before settling in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, where he ran a scuba-diving business for 18 months using an alias. By the time he was placed in the custody of that country's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 12, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> had been named the most wanted fugitive by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Marshal's office. While in foreign custody, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was kept in a room with a board for a mattress and an overflowing toilet, fed spoiled food, injected with drugs and beaten when he tried to sleep, his attorneys say. Officials there also gave him daily injections of <LOCATION> Talacen </LOCATION>, a mild narcotic, and Valium, an anti-anxiety drug, laced his tea with hallucinogenics, and gave him other drugs, the motion said. After 12 days in custody, `` due to complete lack of sleep, substantial drug consumption, exhaustion and pain, Mr. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was mentally and physically exhausted,'' the motion said. While in this condition, <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> was handed over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents who escorted him back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacovelle </PERSON> did not return calls Monday. Attempts to contact Maldiven officials were unsuccessful. Calls to the <LOCATION> Maldiven </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were not returned. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for his disappearance and up to 150 years in prison if convicted of charges stemming from the second pension fund case.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors in the murder trial of an airline pilot accused of killing his wife and disposing of parts of her body with a woodchipper tried to prove the woman is dead by noting it was out-of-character for her not to stay in touch with her mother. <PERSON> Helle </PERSON> <PERSON> Crafts </PERSON>, a flight attendant for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, was last seen Nov. 18, 1986, when friends drove her to her <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> home after a flight from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Her body has never been found, and her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> <PERSON> Crafts </PERSON>, 50, was charged with her murder. Mrs. Crafts' mother, <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Horsholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, testified Monday that her daughter had written letters to her every two to three weeks and called her once every week or two. Testifying through an interpreter, Mrs. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said her last contact with her daughter was a telephone call on Nov. 17, 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> was the first witness called by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> in a trial expected to last six to eight weeks. The state also produced a revealing letter the woman's daughter had sent Mrs. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> in October 1986. In the letter, read by the interpreter after the jury was ordered out of the courtroom, Mrs. <PERSON> Crafts </PERSON> told her mother she had informed her husband that she wanted a divorce and that he was `` seemingly not happy about the idea.'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> ruled that the part of the letter purporting to describe Crafts' reactions could not be admitted into evidence. But a portion of the letter in which Mrs. <PERSON> Crafts </PERSON> said she no longer trusted her husband apparently will be allowed into evidence, and <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said he was pleased with the judge's decision The prosecution was dealt a blow before the trial began when the judge ruled that a clump of wood chips and human tissue seized from Crafts' car could not be used against him. The chief state medical examiner issued a death certificate based on the tissue found in the trunk and some body fragments, including a dental cap and a finger tip, police said they found along the <LOCATION> Housatonic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> held that authorities lacked the proper legal grounds to seize Crafts' vehicle. Defense attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagarin </PERSON> said he was disappointed the judge did not also order the suppression of evidence seized from Crafts' home, which included carpet samples, a comforter and a pair of men's shoes. The judge also ordered the sequestering of all potential witnesses except the principal investigators for the state and the defense. The ruling brought an objection from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> author who has a contract to write a book on the case and a film script.

 Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> today called for the two top defense officials to resign over the escape of the leader of the bloody August coup attempt. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and armed forces Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> showed `` negligence and ineptness'' in allowing the escape of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> fled a military prison boat Saturday with 14 guards. At a breakfast forum today, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said he had not sheltered <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> at his beach house. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> served as military security chief when <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was defense minister. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was fired from that post in November 1986. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the Aug. 28 failed coup against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, escaped from the ship where he had been held since his capture in December. The August coup attempt left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. Chief military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said today a nationwide search had turned up no significant leads on <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s whereabouts But <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said three soldiers missing since Monday from an air force detention center had surrendered and were in custody. All four had been jailed in connection with coup attempts. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said Capt. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Logro </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampol </PERSON>, and Sgt. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Anggulo </PERSON> gave up to military authorities, who found them at their homes in three provinces south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The spokesman said a fourth soldier, Lt. <PERSON> Belarmino </PERSON> <PERSON> Munar </PERSON>, remained missing. A private radio station, <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION>, quoted air force authorities as saying <PERSON> Munar </PERSON> had fled to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with his wife on March 21, the day he escaped. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> also renewed charges today that government troops raided his beach house near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in search of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. The military, however, has denied it conducted a raid. `` If it is proven that I had something to do with the escape of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and ... that I know where he is, I will resign,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` But they, de Villa and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, should also resign for negligence and ineptness.'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> urged journalists to ignore a government ban on interviews with <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. He offered his services as lawyer to journalists who might be prosecuted for violating the ban. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> sent Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> a letter today asking for the creation of an independent, civilian body to investigate <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and others involved in the attempted coup. Mrs. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> accused the government of prejudging her husband's case Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> have described the escape as an `` admission of guilt'' and called <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> `` an enemy of the state.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s wife described the escape as `` a sudden disappearance'' and added, `` as a wife and mother, I fear for his health and safety.'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> led the military revolt that helped oust <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and bring Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> later broke with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

In a major full-page article, the authoritative newspaper said papers should not print material that undermines <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform the economy and to allow freer discussion of some issues Pravda said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> needs people who are dedicated to improving housing, food supplies and services, not people obsessed with uncovering suspected enemies, as was <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` A patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged ` internal threat' to socialism, who joining with a few political extremists seeks internal enemies everywhere,'' Pravda said. `` A patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country, of the people, without fear of any difficulty,'' the newspaper said. Pravda's article appeared to be an effort to strengthen <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hand going into an unusual June Communist Party conference and an indication that the Soviet leader still faces stiff conservative resistance. The conference gives <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the possibility of replacing opponents with his supporters to strengthen support for his policies. The article was written as a criticism of a letter by <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyeva </PERSON> defending <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and published by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> on March 13. The Soviet press in the last year has sharply criticized <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s excesses, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in November said the dictator's guilt for the purges in which millions died was `` enormous and unforgivable. However, he defended <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture. Pravda echoed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s criticism, but said his opponents wo n't let the issue rest either because they feel more comfortable with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressive ways or because it serves their personal interest. `` In one person this may be directed at taking more and giving less, in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts to claim a monopoly in science, personal innocence or something else,'' Pravda said. It criticized <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s system as `` thoughtless execution of orders and suppression of initiative.'' It said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not hide from the fact that `` many thousands'' of party workers, economic and military officials, scientists and cultural figures were exiled or killed by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> embarked on `` perestroika'' _ his effort to restructure <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society _ at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in April 1985. Pravda said his opponents are concerned that the reforms will undermine the principles of the Soviet system. `` Not all realize fully that the administrative-command methods have exhausted themselves. All who pin hopes on those methods or their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact that we have had that more than once, but it did not bring about the desired results,'' Pravda said. Pravda said the letter in <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> was `` an attempt, little by little, to revise party decisions.'' `` At meetings at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it has been said more than once that the Soviet press is not a private shop and that the Communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware of their responsibility for the articles and the publications.'' `` In this case the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> ... has departed from this principle,'' Pravda said. It said the press should publish criticism that will help supporters of the restructuring to unite their forces, rather than articles that encourage disunity.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says he never heard of a plan to swap military parts for the 52 Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the last year of his term. `` No one that I have talked to had heard of it,'' he added at a news conference Monday night following a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Newly declassified documents revealed in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee investigation showed the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration considered offering $ 10 million in military spare parts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the hostages captured in November 1979 during an attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> advisers scuttled the plan after determining arms dealer <PERSON> Houshang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavi </PERSON> did n't have the backing of then-Iranian president <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>, according to documents obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> memo said Lavi offered to make a hostage exchange and handed over a seven-page list of F-14 parts. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer who wrote the memo recommended against pursuing the deal. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he never saw any of the memos and that the plan was `` never seriously considered.'' The documents include <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> memos to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memos by then-Deputy Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. The papers surfaced during a hearing being held by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., into attempts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to trade arms with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for hostages seized by Iran-backed Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> During his speech, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't always use its power as it should to promote human rights. `` When there is a silence from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, there is a worldwide silence,'' he said. `` What the oppressed fear most is a silence from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, whose policy as president was to publicly criticize nations that abused human rights, told the crowd that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been `` on the wrong side of human rights issues in almost every case.'' He urged that the next president develop a foreign policy that would `` alleviate suffering by the use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence.''

 Officers shot to death a man they said was a suspect in a gang-related drive-by killing and two men were wounded in still another drive-by incident as violent gang confrontations continued, police said. Monday's fatal shooting took place on the same day Police Chief <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> unveiled plans to have 1,000 officers work four hours of overtime each to fight gang warfare, and Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he would support whatever measures are needed to take back control of the city's streets. Police said a 19-year-old man, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was shot to death when he allegedly reached for his waistband as two officers attempted to take him into custody. The officers believed the man was reaching for a handgun, but no gun was found, Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s officer-involved shooting unit, said Monday He would not say if Officers <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Moberly </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maillet </PERSON>, 31, were under investigation. Police said the man was suspected of participating in a drive-by shooting earlier Monday in which a 27-year-old man, whose name also was withheld, was killed by a shotgun blast while standing with a group of people on the city's gang-ridden southwest side. <PERSON> Gennaire </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 19, who was with the man killed by the officers, was arrested for investigation of murder, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Two other young men were listed in stable condition at area hospitals today after being shot Monday night in another gang-related drive-by shooting, police said. The gunmen escaped. Meanwhile, the Police Department will ask for $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> this week to pay for overtime salaries, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday. `` We are determined to take back the streets of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and restore them to the decent, law-abiding citizens of this community,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said in support. `` Whatever that takes, I am prepared to back the Police Department and the chief of police in that effort.'' Gang violence has long been a problem, but a drive-by shooting on Good Friday that killed one person and wounded a dozen, including a 4-year-old boy, triggered new calls for action. The assault may have been the city's worst in terms of the number of victims, police said. Five people were killed and five others injured in a gang shooting outside a home in October 1984. A police task force converged on gang areas Saturday night and early Sunday, arresting 175 people for investigation of a variety of alleged offenses and interrogating 619 people, 500 of them believed to be gang members. In nine sweeps since February, 1,203 people have been arrested, of which 996 were gang members, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> declined to say which day the expanded force would be deployed, saying he did n't want to tip his hand to the gangs. `` We'll do it long enough that they get the message,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> also proposed the use of wiretaps against gangs, which <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he supported. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said he did not believe the city needed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s help now, but he added, `` maybe sometime down the road it will become necessary.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> has called on Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to dispatch the Guard. In a separate move, the mayor Monday also proposed a plan for spending $ 2.8 million to hire unarmed rangers and improve facilities at 66 parks, mostly in the inner city, where gangs have forced out park users.

<HEAD>Study Urges Development of Leaner Meats and Dairy Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans eat too much animal fat and the government should rewrite its regulations to encourage the production of leaner meats and dairy products, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said today. The council, in a report on a 2 -LCB- - year study, said that despite a decline in fat consumption in recent years, Americans' dietary habits still center too heavily on meat and dairy products rich in animal fats, which can cause a variety of health problems `` The nutrition-related health problems experienced by a large segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population today arise from overconsumption of fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol,'' the report said. For other Americans, the report added, dietary problems center on not getting enough calories, iron or calcium. Overall, the report said, `` The incidence of nutrition-related health problems is significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every American family.'' Among the diet-related health problems cited are: _ About 34 million Americans are overweight _ Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods _ Osteoporosis, a disease caused by the leaching of calcium from bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults _ From eight and 12 million children are hungry due to inadequate diets _ Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia The study said that the present system of government regulations in the meat industry tends to put more animal fat on American tables. `` The present grading system for retail meats is not only costly and inefficient but it encourages the overfattening of beef and lamb,'' the report said. `` Trimming of fat at slaughter or at purchase is only a partial, short-term response. The real solution lies in the production of leaner animals.'' Among the recommendations made in the study were that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> permit the removal of fat from carcasses immediately after slaughter, a system called `` hot fat trimming.'' This, in effect, would penalize meat producers for additional fat in the carcasses, the report said. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that `` hot fat trimming'' has been proposed and now is under study by the industry. The study also recommended that ways be found to reduce the cholesterol in animal products, to identify the fat and protein content of live animals and carcasses, and to reduce the fat and fatty acid ratios of meat, milk and eggs through breeding or feeding programs. Ways also should be found, the report said, to reduce the amount of salt contained in prepared meats and meat products. Additionally, the study said that the Food and Drug Administration should establish standards for such terms as `` natural'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> restrict use of the terms `` light'', `` lite'' and `` lean'' to `` some objective standard'' for cuts of meat. The terms then would apply to specific nutrient content and identify levels of fat in meat and other products.

<HEAD>Newborn Baby Rescued From Bag on South African River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWCASTLE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fisherman rescued a newborn from a plastic trash bag floating on a river after hearing the baby crying, police said today. The baby, whom police called `` Moses,'' was wrapped in newspaper with his umbilical cord still attached when he was found Monday, according to police. He was in satisfactory condition today at <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION> hospital about 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The air in the sealed bag had kept it afloat and saved the life of the baby, born about an hour before it was rescued, according to police Lt. <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Straaten </PERSON>. Officials said the child had a light complexion, brown hair, and could be Indian or mixed-race. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bekker </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, 19, were fishing on the shore of the <LOCATION> Ncandu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION> when they saw the trash bag floating downstream. They heard cries but thought at first they came from the opposite bank, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. When the bag got stuck in reeds near shore about 30 yards from the fishermen, they realized the cries were coming from inside, the news agency said. <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, a bank clerk with an artificial leg, took off his clothes and swam across the swiftly flowing river, opened the bag and found the baby, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Straaten </PERSON> said. The news agency said <PERSON> Venter </PERSON> tied off the umbilical cord with catgut and cut it. The two men then rushed the child to the hospital. The agency quoted police as saying the baby could have been dropped into the river from a bridge along the main Johannesburg-Newcastle Highway.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Charged With Murder in Killing of Man Outside His

<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old high school student who shot through a window and killed a man he thought was breaking into his bedroom has been charged with murder. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail for the second night Monday without bond. City authorities had recommended a low bond, but a circuit judge was not in town Monday to set bond, as required in a murder charge. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a 10th grader at <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> High School with no previous record, called police late Sunday night to report he had shot a man he believed was trying to break into his house, <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> told police a man came to the house while he was asleep and rang the doorbell for about four minutes at 11:40 p.m., but the youth did not answer, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. A short time later, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> told police he heard the screen being taken off his bedroom window. He then loaded a 20-gauge shotgun, looked through the window and saw someone, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> then sat on the bed and fired a shot through the window, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` He said he was very afraid,'' the officer said. Coroner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> identified the dead man as <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, who was unarmed, was shot once through the neck, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Police records showed <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> had several prior convictions and a charge of common law robbery filed in October was pending when he was killed. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s arrest angered his mother, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who said Monday: `` I feel they should n't have arrested him like that and charged him with murder. He was frightened. He was afraid in his bedroom.'' She said the charges against her son contrasted with the treatment given an 11-year-old youth in <LOCATION> Switzer </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, who shot and killed two intruders in the family home last month. Officials in that case did n't charge the youth. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> would n't comment on the <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> case except to say the intruders in that case were inside the home. `` We charged him -LRB- <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> -RRB- for technical reasons,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` Any time a life is taken, the normal procedure is to charge somebody, even if it's a police officer who did the shooting.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said the action would allow the courts to clear the youth of any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
 A court today ordered a 43-year-old art dealer held on espionage charges after a prosecutor said he was caught contacting a foreign power on radio equipment in his north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON>, who has a Dutch passport but says he is Czechoslovak, was ordered held until his next court appearance May 3 after the brief hearing under tight security at Bow Street Magistrate's Court. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> was charged under section seven of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Official Secrets Act, which deals with the prosecution of people suspected of preparing to set up a spying operation The allegation was that he `` recorded and ciphered information and was in possession of equipment to decipher that information,'' police said. No further details were given. Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibby </PERSON> said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> was arrested while `` making direct contact with a foreign power and that transmitting equipment was found in his possession.'' Police, after keeping watch on the apartment, arrested van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> on Saturday. They removed boxes and bags of files and other materials from the apartment where he lived alone. British press reports said van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> was suspected of being a Czechoslovak secret agent working for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> was suspected of being part of a Soviet-run international spy ring seeking secrets of underwater weapons development and submarines, in which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is a world leader. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets wanted to know how <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tracked Soviet submarines heading into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> from their base at <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Marconi, a British electronics company, plays a major role in the development of submarine technology. In court, the prosecutor told magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartle </PERSON> that van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> claimed to be Czechoslovak despite having a Dutch passport, and police said his nationality was `` not absolutely clear.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> sat impassively during the three-minute hearing. He was not asked to plead and did not seek bail. British newspapers reported that MI5, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s counterespionage secret service, ordered van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>'s arrest after investigating more than six months, including by plainclothes police. Neighbors said a team of five men and a woman had occupied an apartment overlooking van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>'s for more than six months and had been seen carrying in what looked like electronic equipment. The Times daily newspaper today quoted two former high-ranking Czechoslovak officials who have defected to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as saying that improved diplomatic relations had enabled Czechoslovaks spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to penetrate high-level British circles. The report quoted former <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolik </PERSON>, a former major in the Czechoslovak secret police.

The man has said he killed the black bear in self-defense, but <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said that's unlikely. `` Our evidence points to this being a deliberate shooting and not the result of a bear attack on the individual,'' he said in a statement Monday. `` The parts he possessed were the head and the paws,'' said <PERSON> Huss </PERSON>, adding that he did n't know the reason they were taken. `` I guess it's like a bullfighter. They take the ears, right?'' The head and claws were found in the suspect's residence after the <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> received a tip on its poaching hotline, said Lt. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> of the DNR office in <LOCATION> Mio </LOCATION>. Killing a bear illegally is a misdemeanor, which carries fines ranging from $ 200 to $ 1,000, a mandatory five-day jail sentence extending to up to 90 days, $ 1,500 in restitution for the animal and a three-year loss of hunting privileges. Illegal bear possession carries the same penalties, <PERSON> Huss </PERSON> said. Last week, the suspect led wildlife officials to the bear carcass in a swamp in the Au <ORGANIZATION> Sable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. He said he found the bear's cubs after he shot her and left them in a trash container, according to the department. A conservation officer rescued the two male and one female cubs March 24 after someone called a wildlife office and said he found the three bears in the trash container, in rural <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The caller told officers he would leave the cubs in a telephone booth. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who is taking care of the 2-month-old cubs at the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, has said they can not survive in the wild because they have been handled by humans. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> baseball club and Domino's Pizza, has offered to adopt the cubs and give them a home on a Domino's retreat on <LOCATION> Drummond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. A DNR official said he hoped the department would be able to turn the cubs over to the retreat within a week.

<TEXT>
 More than any other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, foreign commentators are focusing more and more attention on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s drive for his party's presidential nomination. Here is some of what they had to say most recently:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> -LRB- government-controlled -RRB-: `` A black american, the Reverend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, has for the first time in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> history emerged a front-runner ... `` Some see it as a divisive force, weakening his party's bid for the presidency and, ultimately, if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does win the Democratic ticket, reducing the choice of president to a black versus white affair, exacerbating old racial wounds and very probably opening new ones. ... `` It would be starry-eyed to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> anything but an outside chance of the White House. But it would be remiss of the next administration to ignore the significance of his challenge. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s dreams are those of many Americans, black and white. `` They want new direction. And while domestic issues are bound to dominate, the call extends to a foreign policy so confused that while rushing to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> it stubbornly refuses to back full economic sanctions against apartheid. `` It is how far <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s challenge eventually goes towards reshaping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dealings with others that has the world's attention as the presidential race progresses.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- government-controlled -RRB-, in a commentary predicting the election of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November: `` As it did in the last election, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seems intent once again on contesting the presidency with a man who has virtually no chance of winning against the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate ... This year they seem determined to nominate in Mr. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a candidate who even <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders admit is unelectable. `` Nobody likes to say it out loud, but the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> phenomenon and the dilemma it has created for the party are almost entirely a matter of racism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Both his present leadership position in the party primaries and the impossibility of his being elected president are due first and foremost to the fact that Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is black.''

Because of the color of his skin, his opponents will do everything humanly possible to try to prove that they are not racists. `` One can therefore expect an increase in anti-South African sentiments in the coming months, in the same way in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> became the political whipping boy of the 1984 presidential elections, when the Democrats were divided.''

<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strength could transcend racial More than any other candidate from either party, he is talking about issues that affect the common man and woman. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years may have created more wealth for many Americans but they have not much reduced the underclass, which cuts across color lines. This constituency, no longer the automatic fiefdom of the Democrats and now poorly represented by the trade union movement, is there to be galvanized. ... `` So, if it is up to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to prove, in the wider arena, that he is not <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it is up to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to find room for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and he has not yet begun to bargain.

 _ The Independent of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` The way is now clear for a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nomination ... The disarray in the Democratic camp is just what the White House doctor ordered.

 `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>,'' a 25-pound male lobster with claws as big as baseball mitts, returned to the ocean today, saved from a dinner plate by animal rights activists, a seafood vendor and state officials. Lifting the giant crustacean by its claws and tail, seafood dealers from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> gently swung him over the side of a <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> boat into 22-feet-deep water near fog-shrouded <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Head Light in this <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, a companion lobster weighing in at 19 -RCB- pounds, was dropped into the water moments later. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuts </PERSON>, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said he was n't used to the idea of returning potential seafood to the sea, but in the case of <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> he had no complaints. `` It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. `` I like the idea of the whole thing.'' `` These are well-traveled lobsters,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> seafood vendor who accompanied <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> on their flight to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Monday. `` We should n't be catching lobsters this size. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> is the only state that's doing anything to protect them, and that's why we're here.'' The two lobsters spent the night in a 12-by-4-foot tank in Neuts' market along the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> waterfront before being placed aboard the 35-foot boat for the half-hour ride through choppy seas to a protected cove off <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old, and her smaller companion were rescued from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> man who wanted to serve them for Easter dinner. `` This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' said Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` By protecting these large lobsters, there's more of a chance of them reproducing'' and perpetuating the industry. `` It shows there's a lot of concern about our natural resources out there,'' <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds. The Marine Patrol said the two lobsters appeared to be in `` excellent'' shape after their flight and enjoyed a seafood dinner in their tank at the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> fish market. `` They were real frisky,'' said Officer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` They put a quahog in there and the big one just snapped it up like it was butter. They left a crab in there overnight and it was gone this morning.'' The lobsters had been trucked from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where they were sold to a customer for $ 287. Animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause when they heard that <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a retired carpenter, planned to use them for a feast. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, persuaded <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their visit to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s Main Line, acknowledging that saving lobsters from dinner was something new for him. `` It's been very good for business,'' he said. Thousands of people dropped by for a look at <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>. `` If they do n't buy now, at least they know where we are,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Not </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruelty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a small animal rights group, made arrangements with <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials to turn the creatures loose and assumed the $ 40 flight cost. It may seem a lot of trouble for a couple of lobsters, but group vice president <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Felscher-Cohen </PERSON> makes no apologies. `` Why not?'' she asked. `` These two lobsters have survived hazards, particularly <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, over 100 years. Why should she need to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said today he will look at the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary results and decide whether to continue his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> aides said many options already have been discussed, including suspending the campaign rather than quitting in order to hold onto the national convention delegate he has won. `` We're going to do well tonight. If we do n't do well, we have to make a re-evaluation,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told reporters outside an unemployment office in downtown <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. `` We'll take one step at a time.'' Pre-primary polls put <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a distant fourth in the Democratic primary race here, where <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were the front-runners. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is in third place in the polls. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would have no statement on the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> results tonight or Wednesday. If <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> makes a statement on his campaign, it will come on Thursday, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reports in today's editions that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would suspend his campaign, but not withdraw, in order to hold onto his delegates. A key to such a decision would be the 47 at-large delegates <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has won in the state, but which will not be selected until the state convention in May. If <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> withdraws before the convention, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the second-place finisher in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, would win all 60 at-large delegates, not just the 13 he is currently allocated. `` Anybody can see that's an option,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, even as he firmly denied it was the course <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had chosen to take. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has won only one contest, his homestate primary on March 15. He skipped the Super Tuesday primaries to focus on <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and then said he would make a major effort in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to revive his campaign. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> failed to catch on in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, although he has campaigned hard around the state. His aides talked privately only of coming in third, ahead of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a finish far short of anything strong enough to keep <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the race.

 A power fluctuation dimmed lights in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and was blamed for a radioactive gas leak at a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> electric plant. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Severts </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the radiation leak Monday posed no danger to the public or plant workers.

That in turn triggered the fluctuation, which he said lasted `` a few seconds.'' He said power went out completely for a brief period in portions of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, but in most of the affected area power levels were only reduced. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaysen </PERSON>, customer service manager for <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> Light, <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not heard of any major difficulties related to the fluctuation. `` I thought someone was playing with the lights,'' he said.

 Every pensioner's nightmare is unfolding here for nearly 6,000 Social Security recipients _ the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has lost or mislaid their checks. `` These checks could be sitting in any number of post offices around the country,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, manager of quality control for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.

 Three convicted killers who escaped from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Pententiary are `` probably several states away by now,'' a state prison official said today. `` There's been no news on them, whatsover,'' said Corrections Commissioner A.V. <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON>. `` We're not searching any areas around the prison. `` Information has been given to other police agencies in the area, and they are checking that out. What it boils down to is routine police work.'' Authorities in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> also reported no trace of the three, who broke through an elevator shaft and used bolt cutters to escape Sunday night. Police immediately gave protection to those who helped convict one of the three, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, including a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, woman who testified against him. The woman, a former friend of <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>'s, received death threats and her car was burned during his trial. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, 35, was convicted of killing a police officer and accused of shooting another. Authorities say he had vowed to kill the prosecutor and circuit judge who had put him behind bars. `` He is educated and cold-blooded. That's the worst combination there is,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Cabell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor and one of those <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> threatened to kill. `` My fear is that some police officer is going to get killed, because that's this guy's method. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said he had no plans to ask for protection for himself, but <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> asked that an extra bailiff be assigned to him. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, 45, were discovered missing from the maximum-security prison during a routine check Sunday night, officials said. State police searched <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> for the three, and roadblocks were set up on routes leading into <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the prison is, to the east. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> was convicted of robbing and then killing a <LOCATION> Brounland </LOCATION> grocer in 1973 after he escaped from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison. He also was wanted in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on armed robbery charges. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, serving a life sentence for felony murder, arson and robbery, was convicted in the December 1980 slaying of a <LOCATION> Marytown </LOCATION> resident, who was found bludgeoned in the rubble of his burned home. Warden <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> told reporters Monday that evidence indicated the escapees had outside help. He said bloodhounds tracked their scent across the street to a museum parking lot, where the trail disappeared. <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> said the three, all maintenance workers, knocked a hole in the wall of an elevator shaft in the prison infirmary to gain entrance to a shed where equipment, including bolt cutters, is kept. Then they climbed through another elevator shaft to the second floor of an unused building, where they used pipe and a cord to lower themselves to the ground, he said. The escapees hid behind ventilation equipment, then used the bolt cutters to cut through a lock on a gate and flee, he said. `` Something was n't right with security,'' <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> said. `` Something was overlooked.'' <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was serving a life sentence without chance of parole for the 1981 slaying of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who was shot several times in the head with his own service revolver. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> had been investigating another officer's report of a suspicious person. At the time of the killing, <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> was free on bond after being charged with shooting a <LOCATION> Huber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, police officer with a sawed-off shotgun. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> was a successful businessman who used the money from his crimes for business ventures. When he was arrested, he owned a bar, at least two houses and several automobiles. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> police officers, who usually patrol traffic alone, teamed up in pairs Monday. `` It's always better to have two people. A suspect is less likely to shoot that way,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Shy </PERSON>.

 More potential jurors were questioned today in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, with attorneys asking panelists about the defendant's mother, former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order Monday that restricted media coverage of jury selection. News organizations protested, and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a pool of six reporters. All three panelists questioned this morning said they had read newspaper accounts of the case since <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was charged in 1986 with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had `` picked on'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s family while the former congresswoman was the Democratic nominee in 1984, and she thought the attacks had carried over to the son after his arrest. However, the unidentified woman said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case. `` The press is not trying this case,'' she said. `` The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted. The long-delayed trial began Monday. Questioning of potential panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on the impact of drugs on society. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> Sr.. Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffery </PERSON> imposed the gag order at the request of defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in the room could intimidate potential jurors But he lifted it after a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemley </PERSON>, a lawyer representing media organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, told the judge there would be publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was public. Lawyers on Monday completed initial questioning of at least seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20. More than 150 people could be interviewed. Several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the role of drugs in society. One man who was dismissed said, `` I'd probably be the one going to jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid. None of those questioned said <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s place on the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket would affect their judgment of her son. The trial comes more than two years after <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was arrested outside the <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> restaurant where he worked. The charge involves allegations that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> sold cocaine to undercover agent <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> after she came to his off-campus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs. The case has wound its way slowly through the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> courts. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed unsuccessfully that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was singled out for prosecution because of his mother. But the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Girl Loses $300,000 Jury Award Against Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has set aside a $ 300,000 jury award to an 11-year-old girl who sued her father for hitting her in the face, saying the amount was excessive. `` I was shocked at the verdict,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said Monday. `` That's the simplest way I can put it.'' He ordered a new trial to decide what compensation <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> should receive from her father, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, a prominent lawyer. But he cautioned that the girl's emotional health must be considered before another trial can begin. The lawsuit stemmed from an incident Jan. 19, 1985, during which <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> was hit in the face after she interrupted an argument between her parents. According to testimony at the three-day trial in January, <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>, were arguing at the family's <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> home when <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>, then 8 years old, repeatedly told her father to stop shouting because she was trying to sleep. <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, 45, told the jury that he followed his daughter upstairs to her bedroom and, while he was trying to spank her on the buttocks, she flipped over, cursed him with a word she had been reprimanded for using before, and he slapped her on the face. `` This is a slap-in-the-face case, maybe too hard,'' but nonetheless parental chastisement for repeated use of profanity, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>'s attorneys. <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON> argued Monday that the award, which included interest dating to the incident, was out of proportion to the injury, which he described as a temporary bruise. <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, agreed there was limited physical injury to his client. He argued, however, that she suffered extensive emotional injury. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> maintained that <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>'s `` bond with her father was absolutely destroyed that night.'' In a separate court proceeding, <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> was acquitted of a criminal charge arising out of the incident.

 An American who says he was duped into carrying cocaine into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was convicted of drug trafficking today and sentenced to six years and a day in prison, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was found guilty by the three-judge tribunal that heard his case in a one-day trial March 26, more than a year after his arrest. In addition to the prison term, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was fined $ 18,000, consulate spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecere </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cecere </PERSON> said the three-judge panel headed by Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Presencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> acquitted <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> on charges of possessing contraband. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` regrets very much this action by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> court.'' `` I think it's important to stress that we continue to believe today, as we have before, in Mr. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s innocence and we continue to hope that he will ultimately be exonerated,'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was arrested March 13, 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after customs agents found 4.13 pounds of cocaine in a false-bottomed suitcase he had checked through on a <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. He has been detained at <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s Modelo Prison since his arrest. At <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Presencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> refused to admit as evidence results of a polygraph test administered at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ evidence the defense said would prove <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s innocence. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> will be eligible for parole after serving half the sentence. The year he has served in prison will be subtracted from his term. `` We do n't know what we're going to do, whether we'll appeal,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON>, in a telephone interview. `` It's a Catch 22. How long does an appeal take here? Maybe a prison transfer would be shorter. Anyway, you know he's innocent.'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> on March 24. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified he had been contacted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> about a four-day job taking photographs in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the Sonsora tourist agency of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Feb. 5, <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, an Ecuadorian-born naturalized American, received a two-year suspended sentence in an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, federal court on a drug conspiracy charge after reaching a plea bargain agreement with Assistant U.S. District Attorney <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified for the defense at <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s trial that <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> told him `` <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had no knowledge that there was cocaine in the suitcase he carried into <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> airport March 13.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> had given him a suitcase to take to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> which he was told contained tourist brochures. He said he carried the same or a similar suitcase from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. Spanish Civil Guard <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, one of two witnesses called by the prosecution, testified he found eight bags of cocaine in a false bottom of <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s suitcase. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified he probably had been naive or stupid but added `` that is not a crime.''

 Soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> surrendered today to face charges that he beat his wife and fired a gun into a car while she was inside. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 54, was charged Monday with assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery. The two-time Grammy winner turned himself in this morning and was released on $ 15,000 bond, said <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has denied the charges. His wife, 38-year-old <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, told authorities that he fired several shots at the couple's luxury car late Sunday while she was inside and that he later beat her with an iron pipe. The incidents allegedly occurred at <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> Beech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the singer's third wife, was treated for bruises at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> on Monday evening and released, the hospital said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a two-time Grammy Award winner known as the `` godfather of soul,'' said the argument began because he was leaving for a South American tour Thursday and his wife was upset because she would not be going. `` I never laid a hand on her,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I can tell you it's over now. She's not coming back to my house. She's just mad because I wo n't take her to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and she's not going to go. She's never going to go.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told officers she was sleeping in the car after the argument Sunday night when three shots were fired into the trunk of the car and a fourth hit under the right front headlight. She said she was beaten when she sneaked back into the house early Monday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON>, said: `` Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> have had an ongoing domestic issue for three years. Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has filed for divorce half a dozen times.

<HEAD>War Insurance, Extra Guards for Filming in West Bank</HEAD>

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When movie stars <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> were filming in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, they checked to make sure sounds of explosions were coming from the set, not from battling Arabs and Israelis. Israeli-born producer <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> bought war insurance for $ 10,000 from the Israeli government and hired extra guards to protect the actors and crew. The insurance means that the movie-makers are covered for up to $ 2 million if production on their television movie is affected by Arab-Israeli strife. The 4-month-old Palestinian uprising interfered in another way: several Arab villages chosen for filming had to be crossed off the schedule because `` we just could n't take the risk,'' said production designer <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. But actors and crew in `` Steal the Sky'' said during their five weeks of filming in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> they were largely untouched by the nearly daily violence that has left more than 135 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. `` We have been incredibly lucky,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said in an interview on a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> set. `` We have filmed in Arab quarters and Jewish quarters and have been in no danger.'' At a time when the unrest has caused tourism to decline, tennis star <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> to cancel plans to appear in a tournament in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> nd Roman Catholic church officials to call off a Palm Sunday procession, the presence of actors and a film crew in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is cause for some surprise. The <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> film is the first movie to be made in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the uprising began Dec. 8, said <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON>. `` In a way, I wanted to make a statement by doing this film here now,'' said <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen who lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Steal the Sky'' is based on a true story and deals with an aspect of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> plays an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> secret agent who persuades an Iraqi pilot, portrayed by <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, to defect and fly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in August 1966 aboard one of the coveted, Soviet-built MiG-21 airplanes the West wants to examine. The plane, studied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is today in the Israeli Air Force Museum. The agent and the defector vanished, their identities protected. Scenes that were to take place in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were filmed in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s biblical town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Anatot </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> shooting took about two weeks. In the disputed hills, crew members could be heard shouting in English and Hebrew: `` Quiet on the set please. Sheket, bevakasha.'' In one scene, a military jeep was blown up. `` When we were filming and heard shots or special effects, I often wondered if it was real or not,'' said <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where politics is interwoven with daily life, <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said it was impossible to avoid conversations about the current debate over what should be done to end the Palestinian rioting. `` Everyone wants to talk about the <LOCATION> Arab-Israel </LOCATION> conflict,'' he said. `` But because it's an emotional subject, it is very dangerous for me to get caught up in it.'' <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said he got the idea to make the film about three years ago, and got approval from <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> for the $ 5.5 million movie last year. Three days of filming in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and additional days in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, are also scheduled. <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said he understood other producers had canceled plans to film in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, although he had no specific details. `` I am extremely sad that people are so much afraid of suffering that they are missing wonderful locations here,'' he said. The production of `` Steal the Sky'' was a model for coexistence, said <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON>. `` We had Arabs working as extras,'' he said, `` and both Arabs and Israelis on the crew and our guards are Druse,'' members of a mystical sect which is an offshoot of Islam. <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said the dialogue in his movie `` is up-to-date. It's a film that shows things that were an issue in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> 25 years ago are still an issue today.'' `` The Israelis have to be strong. You can not make peace with a scared people,'' he said. `` We are in a marathon race with the Arabs. Whoever is strong will win.''

<TEXT>
 The first of 1,300 additional American troops flew to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today in what Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military regime called an `` invasion.'' With the first cargo plane scheduled to arrive late this afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique calling the additional soldiers potential AIDS carriers. Meanwhile, neighbors and aides said state security agents surrounded the home of <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a leading government opponent. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, an aide who was in <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s home, said in a telephone interview the house was surrounded Monday night by four carloads of plainclothes police who continued their vigil early today. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was not at home, but declined to disclose his whereabouts. The aide said the party leader's wife and other family members were in the house `` and are virtually incommunicado except for the phone.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the `` growing number of American soldiers'' not only `` constitute an armed threat to our sovereignty and independence,'' but `` a real danger to the health of our people.'' The ministry maintained that tests showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel show a high rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal disease that can be transmitted by sexual contact. `` Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with these soldiers,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has begun screening military personnel for exposure to the virus that causes AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reported in February that about 3,000 of some 2 million active duty personnel tested positive for the virus. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said last week it was sending the additional soldiers to bolster 10,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and installations used to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The decision followed five weeks of unrest and an opposition attempt to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. As head of the 15,000-member Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the power behind the civilian government. He is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>, a military-run newspaper, told its readers Sunday, `` Panamanians must prepare themselves to reject the invasion.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends the troop buildup is within the bounds of the 1977 treaties that gave the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone back to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1979 and will give <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> the canal at the end of 1999. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which supports the opposition move to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has cut off <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s flow of dollars, virtually paralyzing the bankrupt government and leading to closure of the nation's banks The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said on Monday it does not plan military or further economic actions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that even though it might take more time than anticipated, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will eventually step down. Opposition leaders insisted on Monday that the strike officially remained in effect, but their call appeared to be generally unheeded by retailers. Many factories, which are more directly under the control of the strike organizers, remained closed. Monsignor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had offered to mediate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dispute between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and opposition groups. But government-controlled television stations on Monday quoted unidentified government officials as saying the government never received a formal, written invitation from the church. Monsignor <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said in an interview on the Channel 2 television station, `` We did n't make the invitation in a formal, written fashion to each of the parties involved. `` The invitation was made through our public press conference,'' he said. `` We made this public, open invitation to all the parties involved.'' The government held its own `` national dialogue'' Monday at a downtown convention center, without the presence of either the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> or the National Civic Crusade, the main opposition alliance.

<HEAD>Judge: Teaching Assistant Can't Be Fired For African Head Wrap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fired teaching assistant's abilities were n't marred by the native African head wrap she wore in class, and she ca n't be denied unemployment benefits for that reason, a judge has ruled. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> improperly witheld compensation from <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hinds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> ruled recently. The 34-year-old <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> was dismissed as a teaching assistant at <ORGANIZATION> Whitfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on March 17, 1987. Principal <PERSON> Kisiah </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> recommended the firing because <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> refused to stop wearing head wraps, court records show. <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> went to court because she was refused unemployment compensation. A commission referee said her firing was based on misconduct, and that disqualified her from benefits. `` There was absolutely no showing that <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>'s dress in any way affected her performance or caused a disruption,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said in the ruling last week. `` Such practices are protected by the First Amendment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution and can not be ` misconduct' within the meaning of the -LRB- unemployment compensation -RRB- statute, so as to deny unemployment benefits.'' `` I hope the case will set a precedent for serious-minded people of our culture and religion,'' <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to commend Judge Banks.'' <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>, who hopes to become a certified teacher, testified the head wrap is a form of cultural and religious expression. <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> said she follows the beliefs of the African Hebrew Israelites of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Her religion does n't force her to wear the head dress, but members of her faith `` wear it on occasion, especially during times of spiritual growth,'' she said at an unemployment commission hearing. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> had sent her a memo telling her to stop wearing the head wrap or be fired, court records show. `` All children need positive role models, but especially do elementary-aged children because of their very impressionable young minds. I am concerned that your appearance is giving them a distorted view of what is appropriate,'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said in the memo.

One of the outside experts reportedly is from the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which has a successful liver transplant program. Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busuttil </PERSON> said he would visit the <ORGANIZATION> UC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> next month as part of the review. `` I presume they're going to ask me to review those four cases,'' he said. He declined to discuss the specifics of the cases, but added, `` Obviously, a zero percent survival rate is not good.'' Dr. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronsther </PERSON> resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION> UC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>'s liver transplant program shortly after the fourth patient died.

 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police are re-evaluating procedures that allow vice officers to disrobe and engage in sexual foreplay during prostitution investigations, a high-ranking police official said. The probe was prompted by local news accounts of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s use of such tactics in contrast to metropolitan police departments elsewhere in the state, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON>. `` We are very carefully evaluating our enforcement posture,'' said <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON>, who recently was assigned to head the force's 26-member vice unit According to court records, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> vice officers stripped naked and allowed themselves to be fondled last year while soliciting for sex during investigations into massage parlors and escort services. The tactics are allowed under state law, but police departments in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and other cities have outlawed such activities because they were considered embarrassing to the force or entrapment. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> review could take between a few weeks and several months, <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON> said. `` Any time you're dealing with prostitutes, gambling or drunkenness, one thing is clear _ vice enforcement is different than other types of enforcement,'' <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON> said. `` If you want to judge it _ it's a dirty, messy job.'' `` We pride ourselves on being a professional organization whose officers act in a professional manner,'' <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A law firm billed the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> $ 1,593 an hour for the equivalent of 25 days work its attorneys spent fighting a land condemnation case. The department was billed $ 325,000 for 204 hours by the law firm of <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Falck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coalson </PERSON>, and two courts approved the fee. The law firm, which is now disbanded, also collected $ 1,372 an hour _ $ 280,000 _ from landowner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> under a contingency fee agreement. The combined bonanza for the law firm came to $ 2,965 an hour. `` The trial judge and the appellate court must have thought it was a difficult case'' when they awarded the fee, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coalson </PERSON>, who was a partner in the firm. The $ 1,593 hourly rate approved by the court was four times greater than the previous record of $ 340 per hour awarded in a condemnation case in 1978, according to a memo from the agency's lawyers The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is considering taking its case to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in part to discourage other lawyers from asking for similar fees in cases where the agency takes land to build or improve a highway, transportation officials said. The case started when the state offered Foster $ 582,000 for nine acres to improve an intersection in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Towcimak </PERSON>, the agency's right-of-way chief. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> argued that the land was far more valuable because it was behind a shopping center and therefore ripe for retail development. At a December 1986 trial, the 12-member <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury said the parcel was worth $ 1.9 million, $ 1.3 million more than the original offer by the road department. To fulfill its legal obligation to pay attorney and appraisal fees for landowners, the road department was ordered by the court to pay $ 325,000, although <PERSON> Coalson </PERSON>'s firm disclosed the contingency arrangement by which it had already earned $ 280,000. `` What our client pays us with his eyes wide open is none of their -LRB- the state's -RRB- business,'' <PERSON> Coalson </PERSON> said.

The pit bull has been impounded, but because the dog has no record of bites he probably will be released after a 10 days confinement for rabies observation, officials said.

Investigators have ruled out suicide and say <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, who had made more than 800 jumps, may have made his fatal mistake because he was tired or preoccupied with filming. `` We have n't gotten all the facts yet.

 The trial of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking suspect <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is expected to start in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> at the end of May, a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was charged in February with murder, hijacking, hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> state court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the exact date of the trial's opening remained to be set but that it was expected at the end of next month.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requested <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition shortly after his arrest to answer charges of murder and air piracy. The West German government, reportedly fearing for the lives of the two West German hostages, rejected the extradition demand last June and instead pledged to try <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> in this country. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport two weeks after his brother's arrest. At the trial of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on Tuesday, prosecutor <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Reibold </PERSON> asked that the accused be sentenced to two years and three months on the explosives charges he is being tried on.

 Police using hand shovels and a backhoe continued digging today in the back yard of a home where three skulls and gruesome photographs of torture were found. The investigation began after a 22-year-old man told police he had escaped from the house after being held for five days in a basement, tortured and sexually assaulted. The owner of the house, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, was arrested Saturday. Police are reviewing disappearances of young men in 1984 and 1985 as well as other unsolved cases to see if there is a connection, Sgt. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s homicide unit said Monday <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy, one count of felonious restraint and one count of first-degree assault. He pleaded innocent to the charges but remained in custody in lieu of $ 500,000 bond. A skull believed to be that of a human was found Sunday buried in the yard. Two other skulls, one also believed human were found by police in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s three-story house, along with what appeared to be human neck bones, police spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> said today. The excavation of <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s back yard was expected to be completed later today, he said, and police then planned a more thorough examination of the house. Investigators already drilled through some sections of what appeared to be a freshly poured concrete floor in the basement, but found nothing suspicious. Sgt. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON>, a police spokeswoman, said pictures seized in the house showed a captive hitchhiker being tortured and a young man who may have been dead. `` The neighborhood is in shock over this,'' said <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bebuhr </PERSON>, who lives across the street from <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>. `` There was no indication that somebody was being tortured in his home.'' Police found a white metal box filled with feathers buried in the yard. Ms. <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON> said officers did not know the significance of the discovery. French said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who is a specialist in cults would be joining the investigation today. While <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was waiting in a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courtroom to be arraigned Monday, he was assaulted by a man whose son has been missing for four years, said <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was not seriously injured. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, 44, told a reporter after police let him go that his son, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, was reported to have been seen with Berdella before disappearing in July 1984.

 Computer literacy is low among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students because few have adequate access to the machinery, according to a first-ever nationwide survey released Tuesday which also found minorities falling behind white students. A majority of the 24,000 third -, seventh - and 11th graders tested by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> knew what a joystick and a keyboard were, but most had little or no working knowledge of computer functions or Despite the much-ballyhooed, decade-old `` classroom computer revolution,'' most schools have yet to make effective use of computers to teach reading, math or science, according to the 82-page <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> report entitled, `` Computer Competence: The First National Assessment.'' Among 837 school computer coordinators surveyed, <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> found 32 percent of third-grade coordinators, 23 percent of seventh-grade coordinators, and 10 percent of 11th grade coordinators did not feel adequately prepared to teach computer science. More than 90 percent of third graders and 86 percent of seventh graders said they liked using computers, and more than half said they wished they used them more. However, a majority said they lacked adequate access to computers at school or at home. The report also found school curricula have n't changed to make effective use of computers, and most teachers are n't adequately trained. `` The difference is between knowing a little about the computer, and being able to use it effectively. Few American school children can do the latter,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the Economy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who called the <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> results `` disappointing.'' <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> is a project established 19 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to conduct national surveys of various educational skills. It is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> examined grade schoolers across the country during the spring of 1986. It used multiple choice questions to test student knowledge about computers and to gather information about their feelings toward computers and how much exposure they have to them. Among the report's findings: _ White students scored 5 percent to 8 percent higher on average than blacks and Hispanics, mainly due to greater access to computers at home and in school. Boys also outperformed girls slightly, private school students had an edge over public schoolers, and Northeastern students knew more about computers than those in other regions. _ Most third graders could identify the main parts of a computer, such as the keyboard, floppy disk and joystick. By seventh grade, nearly all could. But only three out of ten 11th graders knew what an algorithm is -LRB- `` a step by step process for solving a given type of problem.'' -RRB- Only 32.3 percent of third graders, 34.3 percent of seventh graders, and 46 percent of 11th graders could correctly answer: `` What is the main role of a computer program?'' -LRB- Answer: `` To tell the computer what to do.'' -RRB- _ Except for word processing, students generally scored poorly on questions dealing with computer applications _ making graphics or working with databases, for example _ because students said they hardly ever got a chance to practice. _ More than eight of 10 seventh - and 11th-graders said they never used computers to make a database, slightly over half said they never used them to write letters, stories or reports, and roughly three-quarters said they never used them to make graphs _ Student knowledge of three common computer languages _ Logo, BASIC and <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> _ was also found to be poor largely because only about 10 percent of students said they had written computer programs more than once a week. About two-thirds of those surveyed said they had never written computer programs. The grim assessment suggests that schools have only dented the ignorance most students and teachers have of computers despite the huge purchases of equipment by many schools during the 1980s. In 1980, 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of high schools offered computer instruction. By 1985, 82 percent of elementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so. `` Although some schools offer excellent computer curricula, many other schools apparently do not provide effective instruction, at least in computer applications and programming, to a large proportion of pupils,'' the survey concluded.

 Democratic candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today complained that the slow count of caucus results in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was `` beyond explanation'' and suggested it may have been delayed to give the appearance of a lead for rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> had appeared `` biased and politically unethical'' for remaining in control of the party apparatus while endorsing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The state chairman endorsed Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You can not very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had changed 30 caucus sites as late as Friday or Saturday without telling the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, had been trying to reach <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> to protest the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> situation. `` It comes very close to obstructing justice,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said the changing of caucus sites `` goes to the heart of the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act.'' As an example of unfairness, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said one of the caucus sites was in the governor's mansion. `` A caucus site in the governor's mansion does not appear to be proper,'' he said. The caucus sites `` should be in very public places, mutually agreed upon by the candidates and the party.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he did not publicly protest the changing of caucus sites while campaigning in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> over the weekend because he wanted `` to avoid creating conflict.'' He said <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> had protested to <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, whose response <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> described as `` not one that was rationale.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to reporters after appearing before auto workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, the last stop of his campaign in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> as voters were going to the polls for the state presidential primary. `` This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it heightens suspicions,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the point was underscored by the fact that missing precincts were in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> _ not remote areas. As of this afternoon, only a quarter of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> vote had been counted. `` To report selectively certain precincts today could be a way of feeding the media on a timetable that favors a candidate you favor _ and of course the state chairman favors a candidate. ... It's controlling the process,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The fact is the count should have been in now ... It is unthinkable in 1988 with all this technology that <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> would come in last,'' he said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> early this morning called off counting for the night with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the lead. With 44 percent of the precincts reporting, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had 46 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 40 percent. `` It's beyond explanation the returns are this slow and this late,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>'s endorsement `` undermines credibility and makes the process look to be less than just.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added that he was n't trying to `` impugn anyone's character. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was hoping in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to demonstrate broad support beyond minorities, who make up a small portion of the voting population in the state, and repeat the success he scored with a landslide victory in neighboring <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> 10 days earlier. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was runing behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the latest <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> polling, but the race was considered a close two-way contest, with Democrats <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also running. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hoped, as in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> a day earlier, that the large, enthusiastic and racially mixed crowds that greeted him were a harbinger of the primary outcome. As he campaigned, however, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was dogged at every stop by questions about his appeal to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave and offering `` to do whatever I can to help alleviate the suffering'' _ an appeal that he made two weeks ago but that burst back into view with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s response on the eve of the voting. Faced with a suggestion from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that he was interfering, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> telephoned top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials from a campaign stop and told reporters he and the administration were in agreement on the need for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave and for humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s poor. `` Our positions in fact overlap,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Our position, that he should go, is the same.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was not warned to tone down his efforts, but the suggestion of a foreign policy misstep was not what the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign wanted just at the time it was seeking a breakthrough in substantial white support.

 A convicted marijuana smuggler told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today of an offer eight years ago by then-Panamian ruler <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and an aide _ <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ to use an island off <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for drug shipments. But the smuggler, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, said he and an associate rejected the offer because the two Panamanian leaders `` were being extremely, extremely greedy.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said he traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in late 1979 or early 1980 with a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> associate who was interested in establishing a shipment base for drugs. They met with <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who now is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military ruler and under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges, for about three hours, he testified. `` They wanted ` x' amount of dollars for each pound of marijuana,'' or about $ 100,000 per trip, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said, an amount out of proportion for the small shipments he had planned. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> also described for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee the elaborate methods he and other smugglers developed over his 14-year career to evade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug interdiction efforts. The methods included intelligence collection, sometimes using officials inside federal agencies, and electronic countermeasures to detect law enforcment vessels. Smugglers would obtain the radio frequencies officials used for communications, and even had the frequency of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, the president's plane, at one point, he testified. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> now is serving a 12 -LCB- - year sentence for his activities, and testified under oath on the second day of a week-long continuation of the panel's probe of the drug trade On Monday a former, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador told the panel that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials helped a Honduran general involved in a drug-financed plot to assassinate that country's president get a lighter sentence. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Monday that top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials interceded on behalf of Honduran Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> because he had helped the administration's program of aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Among those who interceded on <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>'s behalf was Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the administration's top official in charge of inter-American affairs and a prime architect of the Contra policy, <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> was charged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with taking part in a plot, financed by drug trafficking profits, to assassinate <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> in 1984. Two others involved in the unsuccessful plot received long sentences, but <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> got off with a five-year term after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials interceded for him, said <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>. At least one reason for the intervention was the general's `` past usefulness to the Contra program,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> censored part of <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>'s testimony which detailed how <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> at one point in 1986 urged that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be pressured from power because of his drug-related activities, but later changed his mind after apparently becoming convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was essential to the Contra policy. While the testimony was blacked out on copies of <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>'s statement, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, referred to it and read part of it in open session <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> today denied that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> had sought to help <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> get a lighter sentence or a pardon, saying he simply went along with a judge's recommendation that the general be allowed to serve his time at a minimum security prison. And she said <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, because he did not formulate Panamanian policy, was `` not in a position to comment credibly'' on any change of heart by <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> toward <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The subcommittee also heard testimony Monday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> probably has evidence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials' complicity in Central American drug trafficking and is using it to buy time. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former intelligence official and consul general for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who defected last year, produced a document <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sent to the country's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic offices in February saying he has proof that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials knowingly established policies that supported people involved in the drug business. `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says he has proof of the involvement of -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- government authorities in drugs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said in Spanish through an interpreter at the hearing of the subcommittee on narcotics. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> mentioned trafficking in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Asked by the subcommittee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., whether he believes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> actually has such proof, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> answered, `` Yes. Later, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he, too, believes that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has potentially embarrassing information about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and is using it to try to maintain himself in power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he did not pursue the matter more extensively in the public hearing because he is still awaiting corroboration of that and other information about alleged use of airstrips used to resupply the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to handle drug shipments as well. `` It's significant enough that it's going to create a stir,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, noting that the information involves an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizen, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harare </PERSON>, who used airstrips in the region to help resupply the Contras. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> scheduled a full week of hearings on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said a series of witnesses would piece together a mosaic that portrays <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy interests in the region, such as support for the Contras, as frequently taking precedence over the war on drugs. `` One thing that leaps out is that despite all the rhetoric ... and the talk about a war on drugs, there has not been a real war,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Thousands of Villages to Vanish to Get More Land For State Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Romanian officials have spelled out plans to erase 7,000 villages and form big agricultural-industrial centers by the year 2000, a move that critics of the regime say will ruin traditional country life. The huge project unveiled last month by <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> calls for radical cuts in the number of villages, from 13,000 to only 5,000 or 6,000. A statement published March 4 in the party daily <PERSON> Scinteia </PERSON> said the move aims `` to eradicate basic differences betweeen villages and cities and ensure the harmonious development of all areas of the country.'' Romanian officials writing in the government press say the program is intended to gain about 765,600 acres of land for use by state-owned collective farms. They say this will be achieved by banning construction of one-family homes and concentrating several families in city-style apartment blocks. Thousands of such apartment blocks _ many with only rudimentary amenities _ have been built since 1986, when a new systematization law on getting more farmland was passed. Families put into such apartment blocks lose their traditional small plots, which are regarded as a staple provider of food in the shortage-plagued Communist nation, and they must use communal facilities to grow food and raise livestock. About 8,300 apartments were built in 15 rural communities around <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> last year, according to official figures. `` The entire project amounts to the destruction of villages, the traditional family cell of Romanians,'' said <PERSON> Mihnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Berindei </PERSON>, a Romanian emigre living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, in a telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Berindei </PERSON>, who is spokesman of the Paris-based League for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, said thousands of churches also were threatened with demolition under the `` systematization plans,'' the official title for the project to reduce the number of villages. `` This project has no equivalent in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. In 1981, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> launched a `` new agricultural revolution'' aimed at boosting disappointing cereal outputs, the source of widespread food shortages and rationing. Romanian agriculture has been plagued by lack of incentives, fodder shortages for private livestock and a system of contracting which forces farmers to sell their produce to the state under obligatory contracts against low prices. Despite official promises in December to enable each Romanian to buy about 13 pounds of meat a month on average, meat is still rationed to a little more than two pounds per capita a month and is in short supply, Romanian sources say. Addressing a conference of local government officials in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> on March 3, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> announced the villages project will entail the merger of scores of villages and communes into 558 agricultural-industrial centers, viewed as communities linking rural and town life. The nationwide undertaking is likely to lead to the relocation of hundreds of thousands of villagers from old family homes to two-or three-story apartment blocks with communal kitchens and sanitary installations. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> urged in his speech that doctors, teachers and farm engineers who live in nearby towns and commute daily to the villages where they are employed should move into the rural apartment blocks starting this year. Some apartments destined for the `` village intelligentsia'' have already been built and officials say the program will be completed by 1989. Half of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s population of 23 million resides in the country, according to official figures. The collectivized agriculture is almost fully state-owned, except for 9 percent of farmland permitted to peasants as small private plots around their homes or in hilly areas where collectivization was not possible.

 Presidential contenders <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed into battle in today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on the heels of an inconclusive contest in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> blasted the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> state chairman for `` biased and politically unethical'' actions in the slow-moving count. Monday night's <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses were a see-saw battle that saw first one and then the other gain the upper hand. When the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> quit counting early this morning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 46 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 40 percent, with just under half the precincts reporting. However, when the counting resumed today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gained ground, lagging behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 42 percent to 44 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had grabbed an early lead Monday night in the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> contest. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> quickly caught up and even passed him when <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> results began coming in. Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pulled ahead again. Today in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that the dribble of caucus results from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> could have been delayed to give the appearance of a lead for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, directed the count. `` This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it heightens suspicions,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You can not very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.'' <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> lagged far behind with 4 percent, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did n't get enough votes to count. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, his campaign fading, said he hoped to score with <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s voters today. But he added: `` If we do n't do well, we have to make a re-evaluation. We'll take one step at a time.'' Pre-primary polls put <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a distant fourth in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sailed to a strong lead in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s GOP straw polls. While voters were calling the shots in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> today, the candidates scattered to regroup for big-state contests coming up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in the next month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounded upbeat as he awaited the verdict in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` It looks good,'' he said as he arrived home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Monday night. `` We worked hard.'' The four Democratic presidential hopefuls campaigned Monday across <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> getting heat from rivals for his contact with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined the criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But that did n't stop <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> from saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` gives the impression of being scared to death'' to take on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in turn, icily suggested <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spend more time campaigning for votes and less time criticizing other candidates. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination wrapped up, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> still contested <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, with its 36 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made weekend campaign swings to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> trying to rally support for 2,784 precinct caucuses that began the state's delegate-selection process. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s enthusiastic crowds on Saturday and Sunday were taken as an indication of his strength. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the backing of Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>. The Democratic front-runners are locked in a close delegate battle nationally, meaning <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 45 national convention delegates were a prize well worth pursuing. Before <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 671.55 votes and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 665.55. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 381.8 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 170.5. A total of 508.6 were uncommitted. At the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention in July, 2,082 votes are needed to win. Today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary was the week's big prize. Not only are at 81 Democratic delegates at stake, but the state offered a chance for each of the candidates to make a crucial point. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought a win in a big Midwestern primary to demonstrate his campaign is back on track after losses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> looked to demonstrate that he could keep his momentum going, and win a big state with a small black population on the strength of major white support. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> made major television buys to try to make a splash before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19, the do-or-die contest for him. And <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> needed a victory or something close to it to avoid withdrawing from the race later this week. Monday's campaigning was marked by quarreling among the Democrats about who had said what and who had done what. Much of the attention focused on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who made public <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reply to his March 22 letter asking the Panamanian strongman to give up power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> restated his plea. `` I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave. Today I reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s actions drew criticism inside the campaign and outside. `` I think it's a bad idea for a private citizen to try to inject himself'' into a delicate international situation, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. But he said he believed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s intentions were good. That's more than <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> credit for. `` I seriously doubt if he would help in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said. And the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> added its criticism as well. `` In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> likes to use to buy time,'' said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did n't make <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> his only target. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gives the impression of being scared to death'' to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and appears `` absolutely timid,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was clearly irritated. `` Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ought to start campaigning for the presidency,'' he retorted, pointing to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s lack of success since Super Tuesday.

The <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION>'s deputy director, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefimovich </PERSON>, said Monday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> would be coming for a brief working visit. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>, who is working on a production of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Tannhaeuser'' in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, said he was invited to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week by <ORGANIZATION> Taganka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, where the troupe was performing <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>'s `` Mother.

<TEXT>
 In case anyone had any doubts, the staff preparing `` USA Today: The Television Show'' for its fall debut demonstrated Tuesday that the video version of the national newspaper will mirror the publication that spawned it. At a news conference at the newspaper's offices just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the executive producer and four hosts of the program discussed a show they said will offer segments that people find interesting and understandable, graphics that will glitter and stories that will supplement _ not compete with _ the network news. `` If we ca n't do it better or different, we're not going to do it,'' the show's executive producer, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, said. `` Once you've looked at a burning ship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> four or five times, you do n't want to look at it any more.'' The nighttime show premieres Sept. 12. It will run for 30 minutes every weeknight and have an hour-long weekend edition. Like the newspaper, it will have segments devoted to news, lifestyle, sports and business, focusing on articles that will appear in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today the next morning. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said the producers so far had 118 firm contracts with television stations across the country to broadcast the program, covering 85 percent of the country. Those agreements make the show more available to early evening viewers than any program with the exception of `` Wheel of Fortune,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who guided <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show for nearly a decade The team selected to host the program include <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON>, hired from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News This Morning'' to anchor the `` Front-Page'' segment; and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a former contributing correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightly News'' and `` Today'' shows who will host the `` Life Section.'' In addition, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> sports reporter, will host the show's `` Sports Section,'' while former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has been hired to anchor the `` Money Section.'' `` We have a pretty much open mandate to do what we find interesting,'' <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON> said. As examples of what the show may offer, <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON> said segments could include allowing baseball fan and former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to call the final out of a World Series game. `` Or let's have the head of an airline dress like a pilot for a day to see how it fits, see how people react,'' he said. The hosts, whom <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> described as `` my dream team,'' not only would introduce segments but report many of them. `` A lot of people can report,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people can read a TelePrompTer. Very few people can do both.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> also said the show would rely heavily on reporters for the newspaper, with television cameras brought into the paper's newsroom for interviews with the writers He said that if a reporter for the paper had an exclusive interview with a news subject, he might be asked on camera, `` What was that person really like close up? Did you see the kids?'' The news conference _ featuring a 12-minute demonstration tape _ was the first of six also to be held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> over a fast-moving three days that <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said he is calling the `` Prop-capade.'' The reference was to series of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> articles based on cross-country and global trips, dubbed `` Bus-Capade'' and `` Jet-Capade,'' by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the newspaper.

 Soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> turned himself in Tuesday after being charged with beating up his wife and shooting up her car while she cowered inside. `` He beat her up real bad; she's got bruises all over her.

 Americans are eating too much animal fat and government regulations make it difficult for the food industry to market leaner and more healthful meats and dairy products, a scientific panel said Tuesday. Although consumption of animal fat has gone down, many Americans still are eating their way to poor health with too much cholesterol, fatty acids and salt, and not enough foods that provide the needed calcium and iron said a report by a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It said `` the incidence of nutrition-related health problems is significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every American family.'' Among the diet-related health problems cited: _ About 34 million Americans are overweight _ Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods _ Osteoporosis, a disease caused by leaching of calcium from bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults _ Between 8 million and 12 million children are hungry because of inadequate diets _ Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia The chairman of the panel, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Call </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that animal products are a `` mixed blessing nutritionally'' in the American diet. `` In our food supply, they -LRB- animal products -RRB- provide about 36 percent of our food energy and between 36 percent and 100 percent of certain nutrients,'' he said. `` At the same time, however, animal products contribute more than half of the total fat, nearly three-fourths of the saturated fatty acids and all of the dietary cholesterol.'' A change in some government regulations, along with education of consumers and technological advances by manufacturers of animal food products could correct the problems relatively quickly, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> of the supermarket industry's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the committee. `` In the future, the consumers could have it all,'' with more healthful meats and dairy products that provide the needed nutrition without excess fats and cholesterol, <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> said. The key, he said, is changes in the government regulations that would provide an economic incentive to producers to change their products. Among the changes recommended: _ Permitting packers to trim fat from animal carcasses at the slaughter plant This system, called `` hot fat trimming,'' would encourage meat producers to grow beef and lambs that are leaner because they no longer would be rewarded for the fat added to the carcasses through heavy feeding and feed supplements. `` Packers would like to trim the fat, but they ca n't do that because government regulations wo n't let them,'' said committee member <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which controls meat grading, has issued proposed ` hot fat trimming'' rules for comment by the industry. _ Reducing what <PERSON> Call </PERSON> said is `` fuzziness'' in marketing terms identifying meats and dairy products that have reduced fats or other nutritional changes The current system approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> bases product identification in some cases on fat content, Call said. Some frozen desserts, for example, can not be called ice cream because of a reduced fat content. <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION>, sausage and mayonnaise also must have certain levels of fat or else be labeled as imitations, Call noted. As another example, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said dairies can reduce the amount of salt in cheeses, but when the product is marketed it can not be called `` cheese'' because its reduced salt content does not meet the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standard. The committee also asked for more precise standards for the use of such meat marketing terms as `` lite,'' `` light'' and `` lean.'' _ Developing technology to determine the lean-to-fat ratio of food animals while they are still on the hoof or shortly after slaughter The committee suggested this might be done with electronic sensors now are used in medicine. _ Encouraging research in genetics or feed supplement technology that would produce leaner meats <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M said the industry has made `` remarkable progress'' in producing leaner meats during the last two decades. Pork producers, he said, have made the most progress because a meat grading system for swine has provided incentives to reward leanness. Similar incentives would contribute to changes among beef and lamb producers, he said. Committee member <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>, a nutrition scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said that despite the potential health problems, animal products consumed in appropriate portions are essential parts of the diet. Meat and dairy products are important sources of such nutrients as calcium and iron and the primary source of some proteins, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is an arm of the government-supported <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>New York Primary Even More Pivotal for Democrats</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary, with its prize of 255 delegates and its reluctant governor, takes on even more importance in the next two weeks as the Democratic presidential race staggers out of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> without a leader. `` Tomorrow it's really going to get crazy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, a top <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> party official, on Tuesday. At stake for the Democrats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a national convention delegation second in size only to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 336-member entourage. And looming over the primary is Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, reluctant to run for president himself but equally reluctant to anoint any other Democrat. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s coyness has fueled speculation for months about the prospect of a deadlocked convention and desperate Democrats turning to him with the nomination. As the primaries and caucuses unfolded and the Democrats remained without a front-runner, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s refusal to endorse a candidate or rule out a convention draft prompted a new round of rumors. There is also a Republican primary on April 19 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 102 delegates at stake, but it is considered little more than a formality as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolls toward the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. The outcome of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary for Democrats, however, could provide answers to questions raised by the earlier primaries, including: _ Can <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> get his campaign rolling enough to again convince party leaders that he deserves the nomination? He campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Tuesday even before the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> polls closed. _ Can <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s solid support among minority voters and the backing of several prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> labor leaders overcome Jewish uneasiness and produce a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> victory _ Will <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s decision to put most of his remaining eggs in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> basket prove to be anything more than a nice post-Easter gift for some television stations and one well-known political consultant Along with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, most of the state's other major Democrats, such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, are remaining neutral. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has said he wants to go to the national convention as leader of a draft-Cuomo movement. While some Democrats have said they want <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to get into the race now, his top political advisers insist that's not about to happen. `` He is as staunch as he's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> political adviser <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Frucher </PERSON> of the governor's reaction to such entreaties. `` The more you argue with him, the more adamant he gets.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary ballot will include a pro-Cuomo uncommitted delegate slate arranged by a group of elected upstate Democratic county clerks who want to see the governor in the race. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has disavowed any connection with the effort. For his part, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he and other party leaders should round up enough extra votes after the last primaries to guarantee the nomination to the front-runner at that point, whoever it is. At the moment, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said the edge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has to go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his strong support among blacks and Hispanics. `` I do n't care what any poll says ... <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has the strongest base,'' said the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> political operative. Recent polls among <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading the field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent, depending on the poll. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been consistently second at just under 30 percent while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have yet to crack double digits in any of the polls. While <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> says <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is important to all the candidates, the state party's executive director said `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has to win this state outright'' to remain viable. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has hired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> political consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, who runs <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s campaigns and who occasionally advises <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will spend more than $ 1 million in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, much of it for television advertising. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, striving to make an impact with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s politically important Jewish community, has been attacking <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issue of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s message has an impact it could hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> most; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jews is minimal following his `` Hymietown'' gaffe in 1984. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is relying on his strong minority support, coupled with a growing acceptance among white voters, to win more than the 26 percent he garnered in 1984. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plans a big television purchase in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a tool he has n't used much in other states. He also has the support of influential labor leaders such as <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, executive director of the 120,000-member <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> municipal workers union, and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a top official with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have the best organizations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also has the most money to spend, possibly as much as $ 3 million, for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> effort.

 Arab hijackers armed with pistols and hand grenades today commandeered a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet with 112 people aboard, forced it to land in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and threatened to blow it up. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media said the hijackers demanded the release of 17 pro-Iranian prisoners held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. That is the same demand made by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> family and one passenger with an American passport reportedly were aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which was hijacked to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers allowed a Jordanian passenger with a heart condition off the aircraft after it was surrounded by Iranian security troops. It quoted the passenger, business executive <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, 42, as saying five or six hijackers armed with pistols and hand grenades seized the plane three hours after it took off from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to handle the incident `` wisely'' and requested that the aircraft not be allowed to take off. But <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> as saying the hijackers were insisting on flying on to an undetermined destination. It quoted him as saying he heard them say they `` hijacked the aircraft in order to vindicate their denied rights from the Kuwaiti government.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> first denied the plane permission to land, but reversed its decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said the hijackers demanded fuel and threatened to blow up the aircraft if `` any person should attempt to approach it.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> he was trying to `` resolve the incident peacefully to save the lives of the people on board.''

The airline identified him as <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Attiaallaali </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shiber </PERSON> said the three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruling family aboard were <PERSON> Ibtesam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> and the wife of <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. Hundreds of Kuwaitis are related to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s emir <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the aircraft landed in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> at 7:30 a.m. -LRB- midnight EDT -RRB- and completed refueling three hours later. The Iranian agency said the hijackers spoke in Arabic and identified themselves as Arabs. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for the airline as saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. And an Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the plane flew into Iranian airspace from the direction of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> summoned Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Faroughy </PERSON> and told him `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is confident that the concerned Iranian authorities will handle the issue wisely, in a manner that ensures the safety of the passengers, the crew and the plane.'' The unidentified Kuwaiti government spokesman told the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> also asked the Iranian government not to allow the airliner to take off from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to take all measures necessary to prevent such takeoff.'' Diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been strained since August when Iranians stormed the embassies of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and brought its diplomats home. Later <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> limited the number of Iranians at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to two. Pro-Iranian gunmen hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in December 1984. They killed two American passengers before Iranian commandos stormed the aircraft, ending the six-day ordeal. At the time, the hijackers demanded the release of Kuwaitis jailed in the 1983 bombings that targeted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government refused to negotiate. Shiites holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> also have demanded the 17 prisoners' release. Dozens of Shiite terrorists, most of them either of Iranian descent or loyal to its Islamic Revolution, have been arrested and convicted of sabotage in the past five years. The overwhelming majority of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s population is Shiite. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, Sunni Moslems dominate the government. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is the closest Arab nation to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which are locked in a 7 -LCB- - year-old war <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has often accused <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of actively aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military effort.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, locked in a grind-it-out struggle for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, faced off Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led his rival narrowly in a slow count from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> spent heavily in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and sought an elusive breakthrough outside his native South. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> struggled for survival, with several big industrial states still to come, beginning with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 19. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> handily and faced only nominal opposition in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> as he continued his grand march toward nomination at the Republican National Convention this summer. With returns compiled from 51 percent of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precincts, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was winning 44 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the man with momentum in the race since his smashing <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> landslide 10 days ago, had 42 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 3 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 3,035 county delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 2,915. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that party officials who favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were manipulating the slow count. `` It heightens suspicions,'' he said. `` It's beyond explanation.'' Early Republican straw poll numbers from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s caucuses Monday night showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 1,288 votes, or 78 percent, and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with 136, or 8 percent. But <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> loomed as a far more important test than <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in the see-saw <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> struggle, partially because it offered more delegates _ 81 compared with <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 45. Democratic rivals invested heavily in time and money in their bid to claim the support of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s large blue collar vote and gain fresh momentum for the rest of the primary season. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a shaky lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in pre-election surveys in overwhelmingly white <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> a distant third. Illinois Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> lagged with single-digit support in the polls and seemed likely to suspend his campaign if he fared poorly. For the Democrats, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> turned out to be a surprisingly important test in their nominating wars, a gauge of a struggling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s surprising momentum. It was a prelude, as well, to delegate-rich primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> just ahead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked for a victory to silence the critics who said defeats last month in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> called into question his ability to attract the blue collar votes a Democrat needs to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the fall election. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aimed for a win in a state where only 4 percent of the voters were black, reckoning that would give him dramatic new stature in the race. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent heavily in television advertising in hopes of sneaking up on his rivals or at least winning 20 percent of the popular vote. He needed that much to re-qualify for federal matching campaign funds. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said a poor finish would force him to reassess his candidacy. A decision to suspend rather than withdraw was one possibility, aides said, a move designed to gain additional delegates from his homestate of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to be used in any back-room brokering at the party convention this summer. For Republicans, there was no suspense at all. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran a television advertising campaign in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but it was hard to see why. Following Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s withdrawal a week ago, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was his only active rival, and he did n't bother campaigning in the state. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> had 81 Democratic delegates at stake, with the bounty parceled out on the basis of popular vote by congressional district. Republicans had 47. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day with 841 delegates, out of 1,039 needed for the nomination. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had 17. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 671.55 to 665.55. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 381.8 delegates and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 170.5. It takes 2,081 to claim the Democratic nomination. So unpredictable was the Democratic race that campaign aides said it might hinge on factors entirely beyond their reach. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> picked a new mayor for the first time since 1960, and the forecast was for an unusually heavy vote in the state's biggest city. Under state rules, Republicans were permitted to cross over and vote in the Democratic contest. When GOP Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> made complimentary remarks about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> last week, some Democrats feared that Republicans might do just that mischievously, voting for the former civil rights leader in the belief that he would be an easy victim for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, competing front-runners in the Democratic race, approached <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and its large blue collar vote in markedly different ways. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the week following his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary victory to retool his campaign's message and style as he sought to erase the impression of poor showings in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. He vowed that he would summon <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and jawbone him into abandoning plans to close a plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to be known as the Great Communicator,'' he said in a shot at the departing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I weant to be known as a Great Builder.'' He revamped his style, as well, serving lunch to senior citizens one day and visiting a children's hospital on another as he bid to shed his image as an aloof technocrat. He also began gingerly criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, hoping to stall the former civil rights leader's momentum in the Democratic race. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wrote to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and urged him to leave his country, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that was a `` bad idea.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, owner of campaign momentum after his surprise victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, spread his message of hope to the out-of-luck, and sought to cash in on the time he spent on picket lines when other contenders were nowhere to be seen. `` I have stood with you, now stand with me,'' he implored the out-of-luck <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, meatpackers in <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION> and paper mill strikers in <LOCATION> DePere </LOCATION>. `` To win, farmer and worker, rural and urban, black and white must come together,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told more than 2,500 farmers in <LOCATION> Amery </LOCATION>, a dairy farming community in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. As evidence of the building interest in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, aides disclosed that he raised $ 2.2 million in contributions last month, more than he raised in all of 1987. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s views on the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> in a speech seemingly aimed more at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> electorate that will vote in two weeks than at <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> voters. Then he criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enough. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gives the impression of being scared to death'' to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said near the end of his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> campaigning. `` That is the opposite of bold leadership.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent heavily in television advertising and claimed at the end that the undecided vote was breaking his way. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, winner so far only at home in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, staked his chances on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s proud progressive tradition. In the style of underdogs everywhere, he urged voters to send a message that said, `` We're not going to follow the pollsters. We're going to elect the man best qualified to be president.

 Rose Mofford, one day after becoming governor upon <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s conviction on impeachment charges, today took the oath of office. as the state's chief executive. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, served as acting governor since <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in February. `` Let us purge our hearts of suspicion and hate,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said in a statement issued Monday. `` I did not ask for this burden. But I do not shrink from the job before me.'' She was given the oath during this morning's brief, private ceremony in the governor's offices by <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who presided over the impeachment trial. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holohan </PERSON> held the Bible. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s removal from office Monday climaxed 15 months of turmoil stirred up by what critics called his insensitivity to minorities and the disorder and corruption that plagued his administration. `` I feel relieved that this nightmare is over,'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON> said Monday after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican, became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in 59 years to be impeached and stripped of his office. Despite his ouster, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said today he's doing fine. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, showed no emotion as the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 21-9 to convict him of trying to obstruct an investigation of a alleged death threat and 26-4 of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund Twenty votes were required for conviction. Minutes later, he smiled and told reporters, `` Well, they do n't like my politics, so we finished a political trial; it's as simple as that. Reached by telephone at his home this morning, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know why people keep asking how I've been bearing up. I've never had any trouble bearing up I've got a clear conscience and I have n't done anything wrong,'' `` This job was n't the end of the world for me,'' he added. `` I did n't need it in the first place. My main concern is for the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' The 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated, 17-13, a motion to bar <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from holding any public office again, making it unclear whether he will be permitted to run in a May 17 recall election to regain the governor's post. There is no precedent and the matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces an April 21 criminal trial on a charge he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped a charge on that issue last week. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he did not know what he will do next, including whether he will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll know in a couple, three days,'' he said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed less than a week after his family announced the <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> dealership, which he has owned since 1950, was being sold because of declining sales his son blamed on an `` avalanche'' of bad publicity. `` Ladies and gentlemen, Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has struck out,'' Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` Chuy'' <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> said as he voted for conviction on the two counts. `` The only defense that we have heard is ignorance of the law,'' <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> said. `` The citizens of this state will not tolerate this evil insensitivity to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> -RRB- Constitution and the laws of the state.'' Following the vote, some legislators received police protection because of threatening phone calls, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. `` They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' he said. The vote ended 15 tumultuous months that shook this staunchly Republican state and brought ridicule and criticism from politicians, comedians and the comic strip `` Doonesbury.'' On his fifth try for governor, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was elected in 1986 in a three-way race with 40 percent of the vote. He made national headlines seven days after his inauguration by canceling a Martin Luther King holiday for state workers on the grounds it was illegally created by his Democratic predecessor, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. He subsequently offended blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with offhand remarks and official actions. On Feb. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, making the 65-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who had been secretary of state, acting governor. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s supporters and opponents gathered all day outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> building and listened to the proceedings over the radio. Each group cheered as votes favorable to their side were announced. Afterward, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said, `` I feel betrayed by our Legislature. I had more faith in them.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, who carried a sign saying, `` Guilty. Guilty. Guilty,'' said he was `` happy and relieved'' because `` I think he's a menace. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of ordering Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s investigation of an alleged death threat by a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> confidant against former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> At the time, Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was about to testify before a state grand jury about the $ 350,000 loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> maintained he did not intend to obstruct justice, although he admitted telling <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, `` The attorney general is out to hang me and I'm not going to help him in any way.'' The governor also insisted he was not informed of the alleged threat's seriousness He was convicted of misusing the $ 80,000 in protocol money by loaning it to his suburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> auto dealership. The prosecution contended the fund was public money and that the dealership desperately needed the funds to make a payroll. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> testified that he was told he could use the protocol fund for almost anything he wanted. His son, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the dealership's general manager, testified the dealership was in strong financial shape at the time of the loan A day after his testimony, he announced it was being sold to avert financial ruin.

 Contra leaders said Tuesday they would not continue peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unless their delegation is allowed to travel and speak freely inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during next week's negotiations The Sandinistas had told the Contra leaders they must remain confined to an airport hotel, said rebel director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, named Tuesday as chief negotiator. `` It is a virtual imprisonment,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said at Contra headquarters here. `` It is not in keeping with the idea of reconciliation, with the idea of democratization.'' The Contras said they will not go to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for the next round of talks unless they are permitted to travel freely around <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and speak with opposition groups. The Contras, who expect to arrive in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> April 12 with a 60-member delegation, plan meetings with domestic opposition leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, anti-draft groups, business leaders and reporters. They will also demand the right to place ads in both government and opposition newspapers announcing their agenda and meetings. `` We are demanding that we be free when we are in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. He said the Contras were awaiting a reply to their counterproposal, which was sent Tuesday morning to the Sandinista foreign ministry. Director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said he had been informed that <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, the principal opposition newspaper, had run out of newsprint Tuesday, and insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> supply it under terms of the agreement negotiated last month in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contras sidestepped the possibility of a public rally inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during their stay, saying that would be decided by local opposition parties. The rebels expect to meet six times with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> before leaving April 15, and will concentrate on steps toward democratizing the country, said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` It will become the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' acid test,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` It will be very difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to keep the agreement and hold on to power.'' The Contras dismissed several `` very minor'' truce violations by both sides in recent days. `` Overall the cease-fire is holding,'' said <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. He said despite initial resistance to the pact by rebel field commanders, they have come to accept the truce arrangement. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> denied suggestions, made in testimony before a congressional committee, that there were links between the Contras and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We have no links with Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ absolutely,'' said <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. He said reports Contras had been trained in that country were `` absolutely false,'' and said it was the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, not the rebels, who received aid through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Two young men who noticed their dog digging in a brush-covered field helped recover an estimated $ 10 million to $ 12 million in counterfeit cash that <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police had been seeking since 1976.

 Three cabinet members in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation have been replaced in a shake-up, an official communique said Tuesday.

The country's leader, Flight Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON>, has been cracking down on official corruption.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crashed Tuesday after hitting trees on a routine mission in a heavy fog, killing the American pilot and a West German <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employee, authorities said. There were no other casualties in the 9 a.m. crash of the OH-58A Kiowa helicopter near <LOCATION> Nabern </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, according to a statement from the Stuttgart-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The statement identified the dead pilot as 1st Lt. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 28, who was assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, 4th Battalion, 159th Aviation, 11th Aviation Brigade, in <LOCATION> Schwaebisch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. The Army could not provide his hometown. Also killed was a West German employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, who was a passenger on the aircraft, the statement said. His name was being withheld until relatives had been notified, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> police said the helicopter went down in an open area after running into tree branches in fog. A board of officers from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, planned to arrive Wednesday to investigate the crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the third crash of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military aircraft in less than a week. A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from a nuclear power plant in the southern state of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, killing the pilot. A day later, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 fighter jet crashed into the southern town of <LOCATION> Forst </LOCATION>, near another nuclear power plant, demolishing three houses and killing a resident and the pilot. The crashes increased criticism of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pilot-training practices. Tens of thousands of West German protesters in traditional Easter peace marches not only called for scrapping nuclear arms, but also protested the two crashes. The Association for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, a West German organization of private pilots, joined the protesters in demanding that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> keep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants. On Sunday, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper printed a article headlined `` This Junk Flies Over Our Heads,'' accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patched-up <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16. The newspaper quoted an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employee at Sembach Air Base southwest of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> as saying poor maintenance and a shortage of spare parts made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 planes unsafe. The report said 110,000 low-level military practice flights were conducted over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> annually by seven NATO-member air forces, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said he was `` greatly concerned and disturbed'' by the report. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> does not fly junk,'' he said at a news conference at <LOCATION> Sembach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said the aircraft pictured on the front page of <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> was the shell of a F-4 that had been out of service since July 1986. He said the aircraft does not fly and was only used for battle damage repair training. He said the man quoted in the newspaper did not work at Sembach Air Base. He said a man with the same last name worked for a few weeks as a gate guard at the base about five years ago.

 Where does a <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger sleep? Anywhere it wants to. Heh heh heh. But that's no joke for <PERSON> Ramelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> and her husband, who ceded their king-size bed to a 100-pound, 7-month-old tiger named <PERSON> Reena </PERSON>. `` I have n't had the heart to make her sleep outside yet,'' <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reena </PERSON> also eats on the bed. She wo n't eat anywhere else, and turns up her nose even at her favorite _ raw chicken _ unless she's hand-fed `` She's a little spoiled,'' acknowledges <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON>, who was given the big cat four months ago by a friend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Reena </PERSON>'s kittenish, nocturnal playfulness rather than a territorial demand that pushed her owners out of their bed, <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> said. `` The only reason we moved into the guest bedroom is because if we got up at 2 in the morning to get a drink of water, we'd wake her up. And then, like a puppy, she'd be ready to play. And she'd crawl under the covers and play with our feet,'' said <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> said she and her husband have to lock the bedroom door because <PERSON> Reena </PERSON> can turn doorknobs. The cat also loves the Rockhold hot tub and made a playpen out of the bathtub. The Rockholds had to take the handles off the tub because <PERSON> Reena </PERSON> learned how to turn the water on herself. <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON>, who lives in the country north of <LOCATION> Zachary </LOCATION>, said it's legal to own a tiger, but she does n't expect to keep it <PERSON> Reena </PERSON> is destined for a home at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which has a 14-year-old <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger named <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> as its mascot. <PERSON> Reena </PERSON> will be going to school at age 3, and Chancellor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> said she might be used to breed <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockhold </PERSON> is in no hurry to lose a pet or regain a bedroom. `` I'll just cry my eyes out when that kittycat is gone, just like any mother would,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held onto a narrow lead over rival Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses today with the resumption of a slow-moving counting process that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` heightens suspicions.'' `` The fact is, the count should have been in now,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` The long count is unfair.'' With 57 percent of the precincts in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> reporting, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had 45 percent of the vote while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 41 percent. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who made little effort in the state, trailed with less than 3 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 3,626 county delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 3,276, according to figures supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Calculations based on the incomplete returns indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win 21 national convention delegates if he maintained his lead in later returns and the results held up at the congressional district and state conventions in the next few weeks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would win 17 delegates and another seven would be uncommitted. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dominated straw polls taken at Republican caucuses, cornering nearly 80 percent of the vote and staving off a feared ambush by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had hoped to use the caucuses _ which are the first step in selecting 45 <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> delegates _ to gain stature for today's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. But with the results trickling in and the candidates within a few percentage points of one another, it appeared neither would be able to claim a big victory. State Democratic chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> super delegate and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, said he believed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would be the winner. However, he said, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has done one hell of a job in a state that is not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> country.'' In return, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized the slow counting process, supervised by <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>. `` The state chairman endorsed Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You can not very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.'' `` This long and slow count represents a certain ineptness ... it heightens suspicions,'' he said. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> responded today that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` is just wrong'' and said he took `` personal offense'' at the candidate's remarks. He said his staff reported every precinct where results were available Monday night. `` To the best of my knowledge, it was run fairly and well,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> contest. As expected, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who stands almost alone in his quest for the nomination, dominated the scant returns reported to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief rival, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, dropped out last week. Early Republican straw poll results showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 1,288 straw votes or 78 percent and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with 136, or 8 percent, at 201 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> precinct caucuses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had picked up endorsements several weeks ago from Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his presence felt with a series of strong campaign appearances over the Easter weekend. While no delegates to the Democratic or Republican national conventions were chosen Monday, the caucuses began a complicated delegate selection process that will culminate at the state conventions in May and June. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> will send 51 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, six of them super delegates, including <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>. Thirty-six <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> will attend their party's national convention The state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had planned to provide results by 12:30 a.m. today from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 13 most populous counties, which account for 80 percent of the state's 2,784 precincts. But the party was able to report less than 20 percent of the state's precincts by its self-imposed deadline Some caucuses delayed their start in order to allow sports fans to watch the end of the <LOCATION> Kansas-Oklahoma </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball championship. One precinct took a recess so participants could watch the game. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaigners were pleased with the initial caucus results. `` We had hoped to hold our own in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and we are doing better than we expected,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state director. `` We are doing well among the Hispanics. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had hoped to seal the Hispanic vote but we have done well there,'' he said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Veit </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign director, said his campaign had spent only $ 17,000 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` I think people in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> still have a sort of a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> hangover,'' he said, refering to the state's former senator who twice entered and dropped out of the race and noting the large number of uncommitted delegates `` They've been on sort of a roller-coaster.''

<HEAD>Jury Selection Continues In Zaccaro Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Potential jurors questioned Tuesday in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said their judgment would not be influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had `` picked on'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s family while she was a candidate in 1984, and she thought the attacks had carried over to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> after his arrest. The questioning was watched by six reporters one day after Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> imposed and then lifted a gag order. Most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper accounts of the case since <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was charged in 1986 with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was then a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. `` I ca n't say I do n't feel the press picked on these people,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillo </PERSON> said when asked if she was pleased with how <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> has been treated. But she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case. `` The press is not trying this case,'' she said. `` The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers taking notes intently. But she stopped when <PERSON> Cillo </PERSON> spoke about the treatment her family received, rested her head in her hands and looked down. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> accompanied his wife and son on the second day of questioning. None of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would be influenced by the fact <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> is <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s mother. `` It would n't matter one way or another who she was,'' <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION> said. At the noon break, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> declined to comment, telling one reporter, `` It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering anything for anybody.'' <PERSON> McCaffery </PERSON> had imposed the gag order Monday in response to complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many reporters could intimidate potential jurors. News organizations protested, and it was rescinded later that day when all sides agreed to permit a pool of six reporters. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he was not sure how long it would take to pick a jury.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines improved their on-time record in February, but one of every four flights continued to be late as weather conditions played a major role in how close a carrier was able to stay to schedule. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that 74.7 percent of the flights reported by 14 major airlines in February arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, an increase from the 69.2 percent the previous month. The airlines with the best record, however, also were those that concentrated flights in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where weather conditions were generally good during the month. According to the department, nine of every 10 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, the government's margin for a flight to be considered on-time <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> followed with arrival rates of better than 88 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which operates largely in the northern tier of states, had the worst on-time record among the 14 airlines, with 61.7 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. Northwest officials attributed the large number of delays to poor weather and said the airline's figures improved to 75.4 percent in March when weather improved. Those figures will be released officially by the government next month. `` We encountered unusually severe weather in much of our system during the first 21 days of February,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>, vice president for corporate relations at Northwest. Other airlines with a less than 70 percent on-time record were <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with 67.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with 69.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had the best performance among the large carriers, with 80.8 percent of its flight arriving on time. The report excludes delays caused by mechanical problems, but includes those attributed to poor weather. The number of reports on mishandled bags filed with airlines declined during February, averaging 8.75 reports for every 1,000 passengers flown compared with 11.83 percent in January. Meanwhile, complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer affairs office about air travel increased slightly during March to 2,584 from 2,235 in February The department releases the on-time arrival statistics for February at the same time as the consumer complaint statistics, although the complaint information covers a different month. Continental, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> had the highest complaint rate in both March and during the first three months of 1988. There were 18 complaints for every 100,000 passengers at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> during March, 16.14 complaints at Eastern and 12.37 complaints at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, according to the department. The <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, airport had the worst arrival record in February with only 62.7 percent of the flight arriving on time, followed by <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> at 64 percent. The best arrival record was recorded at <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. Both airports had on-time arrival rates of nearly 83 percent. <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, recorded an 80.7 on-time percentage.

<TEXT>
 While nearly 50 percent of reported rape victims are adolescents, many pediatricians are ill-equipped to treat them, the American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> says in urging better training to handle sexual assault victims. In a policy statement published in the April issue of its monthly journal, Pediatrics, the academy notes that pediatricians frequently serve in emergency rooms as the primary health-care provider in adolescent rapes. Pediatricians `` need to be sensitive to the acute emotional problems, not to do things that might cause further psychological trauma,'' Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Schonberg </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adolescence </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday Doctors should avoid `` accusatory questioning, -LRB- or -RRB- forcing testing on somebody who really does n't want to be tested; that becomes another assault,'' he said. `` One has to find a sensitive balance between the need to accumulate evidence and the need to protect the young person from yet another assault,'' he said. Immediately after the assault `` might not be the best time to do an internal examination,'' he said. `` It still does occur, that young people ... are dealt with insensitively and their medical contact therefore is not helpful to them,'' said <PERSON> Schonberg </PERSON>, director of the division of adolescent medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Citing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, <PERSON> Schonberg </PERSON> said nearly 50 percent of rape victims are young people under the age of 21. `` We would urge that every pediatric training program'' include instruction in how to deal with the emotional and physical problems associated with rape, he said. `` Most pediatricians have had little prior experience or training in managing such problems,'' members of the committee wrote in the journal. `` Residency and continued medical education programs should assist the pediatrician in developing the necessary skills and techniques for treating these patients in a sensitive and supportive manner.'' The article included a sample sexual assault data sheet that is widely available to pediatricians, with guidelines on what an exam of a rape victim should include. It urged discretion in the use of pregnancy prevention drugs, noting that they can produce nausea, vomiting and other side effects that could add to the victim's trauma. `` The incidence of pregnancy after rape is extremely low ... so the wisdom of using these drugs is questionable,'' the authors wrote. `` The practioner who chooses to use those drugs should be fully informed about these factors and should share these facts with patients.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, legislative counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he advocates better training for physicians and others who deal with victimized youths. `` I think generally there's a feeling that professionals _ whether they're physicians, or attorneys or teachers _ whose jobs bring them into contact with children, are not prepared to deal with the kinds of situations that children find themselves in, where are they are victimized,'' he said by telephone Tuesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, these professionals are the ones in our communities who have the contact with the children that should require them to be the best prepared,'' he said. `` I think that it may be a factor of our educational system, that has not recognized the extent to which children are victims of abuse or exploitation,'' <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> said, `` because certainly it's only been in the last 15 to 20 years that social services and medical professionals have even been able to identify the numbers of children who are victims.''

 The King of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and even <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> were n't enough to lure viewers to their sets over the holiday weekend, according to last week's Nielsen ratings. The week ending April 3 was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fifth weekly win in a row and its 24th win in the 30-week season, which ends in two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 14.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 12.8 and CBS 12.6. The season-to-date averages are: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 16.2, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.8, CBS 13.5. All three networks lost viewers on Easter Sunday. The three-network share, or percentage of the viewing audience, is an average 71 for the season. On Sunday it was 67, and 69 for the week. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won the night with `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote'' leading into `` The Woman He Loved,'' the story of King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s abdication to marry <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, an American divorcee. The movie, starring <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, had a rating of 14.5 and a 25 share and ranked 27th. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> launched the two-part `` The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' starring <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> as matriarch of an immigrant family, but got only a 13.1 and 22 share to rank 40th out of 73. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> began the evening badly with a repeat of an <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> special that got a measly 4.2 rating and 9 share and was the lowest-rated prime-time network show of the week. That, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said, provided a poor lead-in for a repeat `` Family Ties,'' which landed in the bottom 10, perhaps the worst performances ever for the formerly top-10 show. The highest-rated made-for-TV movie was last Monday's `` Addicted to His Love'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which was 10th. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> came in for the night with the theatrical film `` Superman II.'' The top-rated shows of the week were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with a 25.1 rating and a 42 share, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` ALF'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Wonder Years'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Matlock'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and `` Addicted to His Love'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won in prime-time but continued in third place in news. The `` CBS Evening News'' was still No. 1 with a rating of 10.5 and a 21 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had a 10.3 and 20. `` NBC Nightly News'' had 9.0 and 18. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> analysts say they are still baffled by the fall of their newscast to third place, despite research they say shows <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> as the most popular of the three network anchors. In prime time, though, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was cheered by `` In the Heat of the Night,'' a series based on the movie of the same name, which ranked 11th and equaled the 28 share of its premiere. Also, `` Miami Vice'' won its time period for the second time this season when it was moved to 10 p.m. EST last Friday. Saturday <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball playoffs on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> ranked 38th, but apparently gave a boost to `` West 57th,'' which had a 20 share and was n't among the bottom 10 for a change. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the night with repeats. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Family Ties,'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' `` <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>,'' `` Dolly!'' `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' `` Hotel,'' `` Buck James,'' `` More Than a Game,'' `` Trial and Error'' and `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the NBC Kids.''

 Americans abroad were arrested at a rate of eight per day last year, more than 40 percent of them on narcotics charges, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In an annual report designed to frighten tourists thinking of taking drugs on vacation, the department said: `` As we approach the busy travel season, many Americans are getting ready for that long awaited trip abroad. For some, the trip will become a nightmare.'' `` Those Americans who assume there is no real danger in buying or carrying just a ` small' amount of drugs on their overseas trip may be in for a very unpleasant surprise,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the seriousness of the problem was underscoreourt's conviction and six-year jail sentence Tuesday of <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 23-year-od by a Spanish cld <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> photographer who said he unwittingly brought cocaine into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in an acquaintance's suitcase. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it believes in <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION>'s innocence and the report said `` travelers should be particularly wary of persons who ask them to carry a package or drive a car across a border. They might unknowingly become narcotics traffickers.'' Last year, 3,041 Americans were arrested abroad, 41 percent of them on drug-related charges. It was a 10eral penitentiaries in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the report said. The largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from Americans abroad came from the inmates of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> prison in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. About one-fourth of the 164 Americans arrested in the area covered by the consulate in <LOCATION> Hermosillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, complained of mistreatment and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials found such reports credible and made a vigorous formal protest in August,'' the report said. Since then, no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been received, the report said. The number of American incarcerated in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> declined, mostly because that country has become more lenient toward foreigners accused of breaking such Islamic laws as possession of alcoholic beverages. People found guilty of having liquor are generally deported a few days after arrest, rather than sentenced to jail terms, the report said. In honor of the 60th birthday of the King of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, several <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> were freed from prison last year and a few others had their sentences reduced. Still, 30 Americans remained in Thai prisons at the end of the year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent more than $ 46,000 for medical assistance and food for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners. About $ 20,000 of this was spent in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> `` where prison conditions are substandard,'' the report said.

 More than 200 members of the 7th Infantry Division left for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday to bolster protection for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and other interests. The unit from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION> arrived at this sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> late Monday, and lumbering C-5A transports began lifting off about 11:30 a.m. today. Heading south with them are 26 aircraft of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s most effective helicopter inventory: 15 UH-60 Blackhawk utility helicopters; seven rocket-and-missile-ready Cobra attack gunships, and four OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopters. `` I'm looking forward to going. This is what we've trained for. We're just going to do out job,'' said maintenance commander Capt. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Bovey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, shortly before the units began leaving. She said the only grumbling she'd heard was from troops who had to stay behind at Fort Ord. `` The other troops are excited. I do n't think anyone is worried ... It's always in the back of your mind that you're going,'' she said. Another maintenance worker, 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, agreed the unit was prepared for anything. `` If we get caught in the middle -LRB- of combat -RRB- we'll just have to do what we have to do ... we're ready,'' said <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been using economic sanctions in an effort to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted for drug trafficking.

 The lack of political progress toward substantially cutting the budget deficit and reforming federal market regulation threatens to cause another stock crash, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` The conditions that created the atmosphere in which a market meltdown nearly occurred are still present _ creating a kind of economic time bomb that threatens the whole system,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the budget deficit `` has not been satisfactorily addressed,'' and he complained that `` regulatory solutions ... have been debated but not enacted.'' However, he declined to single out either <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for blame. Both are about equally responsible for failure to reduce the budget deficit, he said. On regulatory reform, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is hampered by committees `` jockeying for jurisdictional control.'' And, he said, although the administration has spent the past seven years trying to reduce regulation, it must now recognize `` the protection of the public must be the foremost consideration.'' `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration continue to be paralyzed in a political deadlock ... I have great concerns about the future of the markets as we know them,'' he said. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> called for the creation of a special study commission that, without delaying congressional and administration efforts at finding short-term solutions, would focus on reform for the next decade. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, who heads the third-largest stock trading system in the nation, ranking behind the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the over-the-counter market, also said the securities industry must move to reform itself before individual investors return to the market in force. He said the current system for recruiting, training and paying brokers has made the public suspicious of brokers. He said brokerage firms should stop raiding each others' staffs, a practice he called `` demeaning piracy,'' and instead spend more to train brokers. The current commission system of compensation encourages brokers to make as many trades as they can and `` raises customers' fears that their brokers are doing business when the best strategy might be to sit tight,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. He suggested commissions based on an across-the-board percentage of assets managed rather than on the number of transactions.

<HEAD>Investment Profits Boosted Taxes of Richest 1 Percent in 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The richest 1 percent of Americans paid more than one-fourth of all individual income taxes in 1986, due in large part to an extraordinary increase in investment income, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The portion of taxes paid by those with incomes of less than $ 50,000 a year dropped from 66.8 percent in 1981, before enactment of across-the-board tax cuts, to 45.7 percent in 1986, the department said. During the same period, the share borne by those making over $ 100,000 more than doubled, from 15.2 percent of the total to 30.6 percent. Those whose incomes placed them among the wealthiest 1 percent saw their share of the tax burden rise from 18.1 percent in 1981 to 26.1 percent five years later. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> analysis is based on <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sampling of returns filed last year, which reflected 1986 earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said the increasing share of taxes paid by the very rich is part of a continuing trend that began with enactment of the 1981 tax cut, which slashed the maximum tax rate on the wealthy from 70 percent to 50 percent. It since has been cut to 33 percent. `` The 1986 increase also reflects the extraordinary level of capital gains realized in 1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate increase on capital gains,'' the analysis said. While capital gains represented only 11 percent of the income of the richest Americans in 1981, the share rose to 15 percent in 1985 and nearly 25 percent in 1986. Capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The top tax rate on these profits was 20 percent in 1986. Knowing that rate would climb to 28 percent in 1987, upper-income taxpayers unloaded billions of dollars worth of assets in the closing days of 1986. Capital gains represented less than 2 percent of income for other Americans in each of the three years, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said. About 12 of every 1,000 couples and individuals have adjusted gross incomes over $ 100,000 a year. The analysis found those taxpayers paid $ 43 billion in taxes in 1981, $ 77 billion in 1985 and $ 115 billion in 1986. Part of that increase is attributable to the fact that the number of people with incomes at that level has increased significantly in recent years. Treasury provided no estimate of how many people earned over $ 100,000 in 1986, but <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> figures show the number in 1985 _ more than 1.2 million _ was 63 percent higher than in 1982. The number earning over $ 1 million a year more than doubled to 17,312 in 1985 from 1981. Between 1981 and 1986, taxes paid by those with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 increased from $ 51 billion to $ 89 billion. The burden on those under $ 50,000 dropped from $ 190 billion to $ 172 billion. About half of Americans have incomes under $ 35,000 a year, including those who are too poor to pay taxes. They paid 7.5 percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 6.4 percent in 1986.

 A senior Vietnames official said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should help rebuild this country if it wants a full accounting of 1,700 Americans still listed as missing 13 years after the war's end. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nien </PERSON>, a deputy foreign minister, made the comment the day before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was to turn over what it says are the remains of 27 missing Americans, its largest delivery so far.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Tuesday he would not rule out the possibility of sending more American troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers new steps to force the ouster of military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We have no immediate plans -LRB- to send more forces -RRB- but I would not eliminate that possibility,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. At the same time, a senior administration official said the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> heads should remove him or ask him to step aside. `` I think it would be a good thing for them to do,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. As the military chief, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the power behind the Panamanian government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking his removal since he was indicted earlier this year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. Meanwhile, some 1,300 American troops began arriving at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to augment the 10,000 troops stationed at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command there. The Pentagon says the deployment is only to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lives and interests in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` With the additional forces being brought in today, I think there is a reasonable degree of security of American installations, and I see no increased, immedate threat to the American citizens living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, vacationing at his mountaintop ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, was briefed on developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a telephone conversation with <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. Later, the national security adviser answered questions from reporters at an ocean-side hotel. `` We continue to examine a full range of diplomatic options, economic options, military options and political options'' to put pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The national security adviser said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering steps that would require American companies to withhold taxes and fees from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But he suggested there would be problems implementing such actions. He said the sanctions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 3 -LCB- weeks ago have had a telling effect on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but obviously have not been enough to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Whether it will -LRB- be enough -RRB- over a period of time, whether we can wait an extended period of time is what we're examining,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. He repeatedly refused to say what options the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering. `` As you examine a situation like this, you look at all options that might be realistic and proper to consider on the economic side, on the military side, on the political side, and we're doing that,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` We are acting prudently and realistically.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also said he was aware of reports that Cuban forces had joined an international Marxist brigade to assist <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but said he had no information to substantiate such a story. The senior administration official, speaking after <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s on-the-record briefing, said there was no evidence of `` any massive <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> involvement. Suggesting that the military force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the official noted there had been one coup attempt but that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` is still firmly in control. `` To the extent that members of the -LRB- military -RRB- are dissatisfied,'' the official said, `` I think it would be in their best interests to remove General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or ask him to step aside.''

<HEAD>Judge Won't Stay Order to Broaden Amnesty Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday refused to stay his order that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration broaden its standard for determining whether certain illegal aliens qualify for amnesty under the 1986 immigration law. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> denied the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s motion for a stay pending appeal of his ruling that overturned a regulation for processing amnesty requests from aliens who had legally entered the country but overstayed tourist or student visas. The regulation, which <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said violated the plain language of the immigration law, required that the illegal status of non-immigrant aliens be known to the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as of Jan. 1, 1982 for them to qualify for amnesty. <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said the law merely required that any federal agency have documentation, such as a tax or Social Security form, from which officials could conclude an alien's status was illegal as of that date. Groups that counsel illegal aliens who brought the suit estimated that as many as 50,000 non-immigrant aliens were being denied legalization under the disputed regulations. More than 1 million illegal aliens have sought naturalization under the amnesty program that expires May 4. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation to extend the deadline by six months. <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, who had issued a preliminary injunction last week, made the ruling permanent.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is weighing whether to invoke a law authorizing the seizure of tax payments made by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said today. Saying that economic sanctions applied so far `` have not yet created enough pressure'' to force the ouster of strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said `` we are examining additional pressure that might be brought to bear.'' He briefed reporters not long after giving the vacationing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an update on the Panamanian problem. A senior administration official, disussing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on grounds he not be publicly identified, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would encourage any move within the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` He still is firmly in control, but not as in control as he was, perhaps, a month ago, and every effort we can take to foster that discontent in the PDF, I can assure you we are taking,'' he said. `` If the PDF, after examining the situation, think it would be useful to remove General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, I think that would be a very sound decision for them to take,'' the official said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> acknowledged that some corporations operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have balked at having their tax payments placed in an escrow account because of a concern that it could hamper their operations. For this reason, he said, White House advisers and other administration officials are studying the implications of invoking the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION> _ which would authorize the government to seize these payments. `` We have to be cautious before you invoke ... because it is a very powerful tool, and the staff back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is examining the pros and cons'' of invoking the act, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` And if it is a sensible thing to do, to continue to apply pressure on General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, we will provide that for the president for his consideration.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> refused to discuss any military options being weighed, except he indicated there would be no immediate dispatch of troops beyond the 1,300 deployed to the Central American country early this week. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant general, said he believes there now is `` a reasonable degree of security'' for Americans living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations there. Meanwhile, the administration was taking a dim view of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s contacts with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, despite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s diplomatic coups in the past during visits to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Following <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s disclosure that he had sent a letter to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> two weeks ago asking him to resign, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday that such communications could prolong <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s grip on power. `` The proliferation of channels is a tactic <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> uses to buy time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We have available channels of communication with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if and when they are needed. We think it would be best to continue to use these channels exclusively.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, also criticized the Democratic presidential candidate's involvement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` We have a bipartisan coordinated plan for dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said. `` That's why it's important to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public, and we believe it's been working.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has dealt successfully in the past with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adversaries. In 1984, he traveled to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and persuaded President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to release 26 political prisoners. He later went to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and, during talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, won freedom for an American military pilot detained there. His efforts earned him an enthusiastic White House welcome. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has no plans to travel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to try to help resolve the 6-week-old crisis in that country. About 1,300 Army soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> were headed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today, joining the 10,000 troops stationed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Pentagon said the soldiers are being sent to increase security for Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In a related development, a former Panamanian official told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> probably has evidence of complicity by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in Central American drug trafficking. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> produced a document <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sent to the country's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic offices in February saying he has proof that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials knowingly established policies that supported people in the drug business. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former intelligence official and consul general who defected last year, mentioned <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he agrees with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should step down, but he has accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of overkill in trying to achieve that goal through economic sanctions that have contributed to economic paralysis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, appearing Monday in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, renewed his call for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and released a letter in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rejected `` any political and economic program that will be dictated from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' `` My duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is governed by the Panamanian constitution and law of the defense forces,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s letter said. While releasing the letter, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> renewed his call for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go into exile. `` I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the Panamanian people for General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Today I reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart.''

 Soldiers fired at `` suspicious shadows'' Tuesday in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and fought <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas trying to cross the border, killing two, the army said. Four Israelis were reported wounded. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters, putting out the left eye of a 16-year-old Palestinian, the army said. It was among the few violent incidents in a relatively quiet day in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where an Arab rebellion began Dec. 8. Forty-one high school students about to be drafted wrote <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> saying they would would `` not take part in acts of oppression and occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.'' The number writing such letters now stands at 107. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> promoting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. He got an inconclusive response from King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, whose approval is considered essential. The attempted penetration Tuesday was the ninth infiltration effort since Nov. 25, when a guerrilla in a hang glider flew into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and killed six soldiers before being shot to death. That attack was thought to have made the Israeli army seem vulnerable, and violence in the occupied territories began two weeks later. At least 138 Arabs and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed during the 4-month-old rebellion in the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> has emboldened guerrillas. `` The fact that the events in the territories are the focus of world attention obligates them ... to prove again that terrorism has to be the main tool for achieving political goals,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` They've increased their attempts, and certainly they will continue to try as often as possible to attack Israeli targets.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group led by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, took responsibility in a statement at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A anonymous telephone caller made the claim to a journalist in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> but <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> office denied knowledge of such a claim. Another guerrilla group, the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility in a typewritten statement distributed in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. It said the purpose was to emphasize `` rejection of the imperialist plans carried by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>.'' An army spokesman said troopers saw `` suspicious shadows'' early Tuesday at the edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone,'' an area just north of the border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that varies in depth from six to 10 miles. It is patrolled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and a surrogate militia called the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The soldiers fired, the shadows disappeared, and blood and abandoned weapons were found on the ground in the area, he said. Several hours later, soldiers encountered guerrillas within a mile of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border north of the <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yuval </LOCATION> farming settlement and exchanged fire with them, according to the army report. It said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were armed with assault rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and about a dozen grenades. Army spokesmen said the encounters took place more than two miles apart and it was not clear whether they were related. `` The soldiers seized positions,'' a unit commander identified only as Col. <PERSON> Motti </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We were 10 meters apart. We spoke to them, called upon them to surrender. They responded with fire. `` An additional force was positioned behind the terrorists. At 5:30 a.m., the commander of the region ordered the soldiers to storm the guerrillas.'' Army spokesmen did not say how many guerrillas there were or whether any were captured or escaped. Helicopters and armored vehicles searched the area after the battle, the radio said, indicating the army thought some Palestinians may have escaped. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters in the Nuseret refugee camp, and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramzi </PERSON> lost his left eye, said <PERSON> Ilana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON>, spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Barzilai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, an Israeli coastal city. An Israeli car was set afire after the driver, a Jewish settler from <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, got lost in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and wandered into the strip's <ORGANIZATION> Deir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balah </ORGANIZATION> refugee camp, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. It said the driver fired shots into the air and ran with his passenger to a nearby military post. Soldiers destroyed four homes of Palestinians suspected of inciting protests, three in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yamun </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said.

<HEAD>Homeowners Would Pay More for Natural Gas if Pipeline Policy

 Residential natural gas rates will increase if interstate pipelines are permitted to serve large industrial users directly, a group of gas distribution companies and others said Tuesday. An industry organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Process </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, disputed the claim. The distribution group, led by <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION>, an East Coast trade association, presented the summary of a study of 14 unidentified gas distribution companies. The summary said that if all industrial customers on 13 of these systems who could be served directly by interstate pipelines were to shift to the pipelines, rates to other customers would have to rise by 1 percent to 21 percent. The median rate increase was 5.7 percent. The increases would occur because the fixed cost of the distribution system would be spread over a smaller number of customers. An earlier study by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> estimated that distribution companies could lose $ 2 billion in revenues if industrial customers could switch to direct service by the interstate pipelines. There are only a few such `` direct service'' customers now, often a factory that years ago chose to locate itself in an isolated area directly on a pipeline route, or was already there when the pipeline was built. The distribution group held a news conference to call attention to its support of a bill introduced last month by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. He wants to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from approving so-called `` bypass'' service over the objections of state regulators. A <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwit </PERSON>, said he introduced the bill because `` when large customers can get off the system and come back on at a later date, you do have some concerns that the remaining customers are paying more than their fair share.'' Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the bill, has said he does not want to deal with natural gas issues this year Nonetheless, <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION>, said he was optimistic that backers could at least win hearings on the issue. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlcek </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Process </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said his group opposed the <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> bill because, `` There is n't a great deal of confidence in public service commissions in a lot of states'' to protect industry, who, he said, often is paying more more than its share of distribution company costs. `` This is cast as industry vs. residential customers. I dispute that. There's a third party in these transactions, the shareholders of the distribution company,'' who, <PERSON> Vlcek </PERSON> said, were earning in some cases 16 percent to 17 percent on their investment.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> signed a controversial resolution Tuesday requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the state Capitol, but said the flag pole would remain empty until he knows which kind of Confederate flag to display. During debate on the bill, black legislators urged colleagues not to adopt the resolution, saying the Confederate flag was an offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>'s announcement came at a news conference the day after the author of the resolution, state Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, said he would refuse the governor's request to recall the bill and change it. In asking for the recall, <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> said the bill did not stipulate which of the three flags used by the Confederacy between 1861 and 1865 should be flown. <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON> said Monday the resolution was written in a way so <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> `` could fly the flag that is the least offensive.'' But <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` If I chose any one of the three I'm going to be criticized for it. The flag has sparked controversy in several other southern states recently. Opponents say the Confederate flag is a symbol of oppression and slavery; supporters say it is historic, not a racial symbol. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the state flag, which incorporates the design of the Confederate banner, and in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, black lawmakers were arrested for trying to remove a Confederate flag from atop the Capitol dome. For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until 1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps. The display was removed during recent reconstruction and Office of Public Affairs Director <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said she did not plan to have it restored. <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON> then introduced the resolution to require the flag display be resurrected.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans fund-raising stops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during the next week even though his well-heeled campaign is nearing the federal limit on contributions, aides said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is close to collecting the maximum allowed by federal law for spending on primary campaigns and may reach that level in another few days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said. He would be the first 1988 candidate to do so. Once the cap is reached, the candidate can not raise any more money for his campaign under federal election law. The law permits $ 27 million to be raised and spent for direct campaign expenses but exempts from the limit legal and accounting costs. The campaign had set a goal of $ 33 million. `` Once you get to the ` max,' that's it, you ca n't pull in any more dollars,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said, `` we could raise money for other candidates, we could raise money for the party or state organizations.'' Exactly what would be done with money that comes in after the limit is reached has n't been decided, the spokesman indicated. However, the campaign must budget carefully from now on to avoid spending over the $ 27 million cap. With more than four months to go to the GOP convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the Republican nomination virtually in the bag. His only major rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, withdrew a week ago, although former television minister <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> technically is still a candidate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won 841 delegates so far of the 1139 needed for nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending most of this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` cleaning up a lot of paperwork ... catching up,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` And he'll be thinking of the future.''

<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid activists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say they have been warned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> they might be targeted by South African government hit teams. The warnings have taken on special importance in the face of last week's assassination in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of Dulcie September, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which is fighting to topple the white minority South African government, the activists say. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> blamed the South African government for Ms. September's shooting death but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denied the allegation Police sources in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the killing appeared to be the work of a professional, and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he would ask South African authorities about the attack. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matabani </PERSON>, said he was contacted last September by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who told him they `` had a strong suspicion that a South African hit squad'' might be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They said they would try and stop it, and told me to be careful,'' <PERSON> Matabani </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did not offer any protection but `` they told me that if I was followed, I should take the car number and call them,'' <PERSON> Matabani </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Themba </PERSON> <PERSON> Ntinga </PERSON>, said his office had also been warned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nomonde </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngubo </PERSON>, a South African employee of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and an anti-apartheid activist, said she too had been contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> several times in recent months. <PERSON> Ngubo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent had declined to discuss anything on the phone, and that her lawyer would probably be setting up an appointment soon for her to meet with representatives of the agency. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, declined to comment about the activists' claims. But he added that `` any information that comes to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s attention about possible loss of life or violence, we're obliged to pass on to the interested party.'' In recent months <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has increased its attacks against guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, mounting a cross-border raid into <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> last week and killing four people. Over the past few years <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> have been targeted for violent attacks.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> charged that Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> called him and the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> `` cowards'' for not doing more to oust Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he did n't phrase it that way `` I did not call <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> a coward,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman. `` My recollection of the conversation was that -LRB- I said -RRB- the inaction would be perceived as cowardly.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> made the allegations in a letter to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> that followed an emotional telephone conversation the two had last week. After learning <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> had denied the alleged name-calling, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Col. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` I think the letter probably speaks for itself.'' In the phone call, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> had complained that the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary was willing to send 3,200 soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> but would not send a senior military officer to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to tell <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnicutt </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator was disturbed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on March 21 to speak to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kinnicutt </PERSON> said. `` You do n't send a deputy assist secretary of state to ask him if he's going to kindly leave,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. `` That's not the kind of messenger or message that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> understands.'' Writing to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had `` been reflecting on your emotion-charged telephone call'' during which, he said, `` you charged that I and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are ` cowards' and that we are ` supporting a drug dealer.' `` I hope you can indicate to me that you, in fact, did not mean -LRB- the charges -RRB- as stated,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s letter did not address the substance of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s original complaint At the news conference, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> released a letter he sent to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in which he said, `` I certainly do not believe that the Joint Chiefs of Staff are cowards. There is not doubt, however, that the lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has made us appear weak in many people's eyes.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on the phone: `` We are being perceived as cowards, lacking the resolve to deal with a drug dealers, a tinhorn drug dealer by the name of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It's not a question of questioning anybody's particular manhood or the patriotism of the Joint Chiefs.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to ask for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s extradition, and said the use of military force may be necessary to ensure his ouster `` I am not in a position to say what kind of action with specificity should be taken but I'll certainly tell you this,'' he said. `` If it's the use of force to remove a drug-dealing dictator who poses a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to our security, to the canal, why, then I think we have to use all measures, including force, to bring about his removal.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called on other nations Tuesday to ratify an international agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer from damaging chemicals. He made the plea in a statement announcing he had signed ratification documents in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s unanimous approval of the agreement March 14. `` But our action alone is not enough,'' the president said. `` The protocol enters into force next January only if at least 11 nations representing two-thirds of worldwide consumption of chlorofluorocarbons and halons ratify this agreement. `` Our immediate challenge, having come this far, is to promote prompt ratification by every signatory nation,'' he said. The agreement, signed in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, requires countries that are parties to reduce production and consumption of major ozone-depleting chemicals by 50 percent by 1999. Chlorofluorocarbons, which are used in refrigerants, cleaning fluids, foam products and _ except in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ aerosol sprays, destroy the high-altitude ozone layer that screens the Earth from harmful radiation.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday signed legislation that gives the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> greater leeway to distribute surplus food commodities to poor nations. Under the amendments to the Agriculture Act of 1949, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> can now measure how much foodstuffs will be sent against available supplies, rather than having to meet a strict quota set forth in law. The law allows <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to disburse these foodstuffs, `` subject to the availability of commodities.'' The legislation also requires the secretary to make private voluntary organizations, in addition to agencies of foreign governments, eligible to take part in the distribution of surplus food commodities. It imposes for the first time a 45-day deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to approve surplus food shipments. And it extends until 1990 a farmer-to-farmer program in which American farmers travel to foreign countries to give technical assistance.

 The role of the news media in setting the agenda for the 1988 presidential campaign is overrated, three leading journalists suggested Tuesday. `` I do n't think I'm the finger of God every night on the NBC Nightly News,'' said anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> during a panel discussion sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's so much the media setting the agenda,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> `` as it is the media having become almost the centerpiece of the process.'' `` The question is, is anyone setting the agenda,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it is the press, it certainly is n't because of the campaign coverage.'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said the media have done well covering campaign issues, but he said there also is a need for `` horse race'' coverage, stories on who is winning where. `` I do n't think we ought to particularly apologize for trying to track and keeping our eyes and hopefully keeping the audience's eye on where the race is going,'' he said. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> said voters set an agenda based on information from a wide variety of sources including paid political advertising and the political climate.

<HEAD>FCC Warns Consumers About New Phone Operator Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday warned consumers about new companies that are charging telephone callers up to 10 times the rates of the major carriers for operator-assisted long-distance calls. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s warning was prompted by a recent surge in complaints about these new alternative operator services, known as AOS companies, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone enforcement division. The agency is trying to determine whether the companies are acting legally, he said, but `` it is premature to conclude whether there should be any action at the federal level.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has begun an inquiry to find out about the companies' operations and the rates they charge, he said `` We do n't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill an industry,'' he said. The businesses are competing in a $ 7-billion-a-year market that until recently was dominated by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. They emerged within the past two years to fill the void left when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T stopped paying commissions to hotels and motels on the long-distance calls made by their guests. AOS companies serve mainly the transient public in hotels, motels and at pay phones as well as hospitals and universities, handling credit card, collect and third-party billed calls. Since January, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has received about 260 complaints from people who said they were given no indication that an AOS company was handling their call or that they would be billed at rates other than those of the company whose long-distance credit card they were using. In most cases, the AOS company has refunded the disputed amount, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. At an establishment served by <ORGANIZATION> AOS </ORGANIZATION> company, callers who dial `` 0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator gets billing information and then sends the call over a line the AOS leases from one of the long-distance carriers, like <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T or <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the callers who get connected to an AOS company are those using a credit card issued by a local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone company or <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing a `` 0.'' Other companies's cards require callers to dial a local or 800 number to place their call. Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along with their monthly local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone bill. Some AOS companies also accept payment by other major credit cards, such as <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> and Visa. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> advises that callers ask an operator what company they work for, what rates they will be charged and how they will be billed before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, they should find another phone, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> says. Several states have begun considering regulation of AOS companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer alerts. AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which consumers have n't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companies say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers before placing their calls. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said, however, that some AOS companies can place automated calls, which substitute `` bong'' tones for a live operator to instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is no federal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, he said. The problems AOS companies present are complex, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said, adding, `` we've never seen a situation quite like this addressed by the commission.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is issuing evacuation permits for <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials to use if they must flee their country after a Soviet troop withdrawal, a human rights organization said Tuesday. The New York-based group, <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, released a copy of a blank 3-by-5-inch pass that it said was among 20 captured by Afghan Moslem guerrillas, who have battled the Afghan government and Soviet troops since 1979. <PERSON> Ludmilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued similar passes to South Vietnamese government officials when they were evacuated by air from <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in 1975 as the South Vietnamese capital fell to the communists. The copy of the Russian-language Afghan permit bears the emblem of a red star with a hammer and sickle and the words `` Permit for Special Evacuation.'' After the word `` Comrade,'' there is a blank line for the name of the card holder, followed by `` is granted the right for special evacuation by air and land transport, with the retention of all housing and food privileges after arrival at the new site.'' That is followed by a place for the signature of an `` authorized person'' and the date.

 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official will go to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of opening regional talks that would bring about U.S.-Nicaraguan diplomatic contacts for the first time since 1985, administration sources say. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special envoy <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to discuss the changed situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Other officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> also will discuss the `` timing and appropriateness'' of a new diplomatic initiative for the region in which both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government would take part. The two countries had direct talks during the latter half of 1984, mostly in the Mexican resort city of <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke off the discussions in early 1985, contending that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were intransigent and saying that the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace process then under way was a more appropriate forum for dealing with regional issues. Since then, except for exchanges of pleasantries at social gatherings, officials from the two countries have not had serious contact. This is consistent with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's view that the Sandinista government's principal adversaries are the Contra rebels and not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas, meanwhile, have espoused the opposite view, contending that the U.S.-backed Contras are a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> creation and that there can be no solution to the Nicaraguan conflict without an accommodation betwen <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Echoing a policy that dates back to 1985, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> wrote last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` should open bilateral negotiations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to deal with security issues and to normalize relations between our two countries.'' Last November, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicated new flexibility in his attitude on negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. He said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would be ready to meet with delegations from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other Central American countries once serious negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contra rebels were under way. That condition appears to have been satisfied by the temporary cease-fire agreement reached March 23 between the two sides. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they do not believe that arrangements for regional negotiations will be completed by the conclusion of <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>'s visit. One official said the administration wants to proceed slowly on this issue in order not to undercut the direct negotiations the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras have planned for next week in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to create a competing forum,'' the official said. In their <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> talks, the warring parties will attempt to work out a final settlement to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> conflict, now more than six years old. A senior administation official in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with the vacationing president said conditions for regional talks have not been met. `` What we have right now is a truce, and cease-fire negotiations begin next week, and we're still working out the cease-fire zones. So the conditions are not yet present for regional discussions,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` Cease-fire discussions have to get started and we have to see some progress in those cease-fire discussions to make sure that they're not just discussions leading to a complete surrender of the freedom fighters and the total abandonment of their interests,'' the official added. <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> is making the trip just a week after taking over as special envoy, a post that had been vacant since Ambassador <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> stepped down last August because of an internal dispute over administration policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> has made several trips to the region since then while serving as principal deputy to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> decided that a full-time special envoy for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was needed and <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> was assigned that duty, giving way to career diplomat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> as principal deputy.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today named <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 post in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also named <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary for enforcement, to the No. 3 job, that of associate attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> made the announcement after a <LOCATION> Philadephia </LOCATION> lawyer and a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official turned down important vacancies. He still had not named a new assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. The nominations of Shepherd and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> will require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> called them `` two distinguished men'' and said they will serve in an acting capacity until they are confirmed. Such nominations normally are announced by the president, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced them at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president asked me to go ahead and make these announcements today from here because the president is at the ranch,'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. Earlier today, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said a heavy case load prevented him from taking the No. 2 position. `` Unfortunately, the request came at a time when I was involved in a number of matters that made my immediate availability quite difficult,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` I have so reported to the attorney general and I've expressed to him my regrets.'' Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said that <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON>, now an assistant secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, also had rejected a request from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to take the job of assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON> decided not to take the job `` because of the taint factor,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Martochi </PERSON> said through an assistant at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that he would have no comment on the report. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who headed the criminal division, abruptly resigned last week out of concern that the nearly 11-month-long criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations and image, department sources have said. The turndown by <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON> represents the second unsuccessful attempt by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to fill <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s position in two days. On Monday, the White House blocked another planned replacement for <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> I.K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, 45, is a deputy assistant attorney general in the department's tax division. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had planned to announce <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> as his choice to succeed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> held up <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s plan, pending completion of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks on his choices. Department sources on Monday declined to specify why <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>'s name was being withdrawn In his statement, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he was unable to take the post offered to him by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because of a heavy caseload at his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> law firm, where he took a job last year after stepping down from the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> after 17 -LCB- years on the bench. In a brief interview after issuing the statement, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said that `` with such a short time frame it's literally impossible'' to take the position. `` If I had more time perhaps I could work it out,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. He was referring to the fact that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has slightly more than nine months remaining in office and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> must fill the position quickly. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in his statement that he strongly wanted to take the job. He said that in turning down the offer, he had expressed to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` a pledge of support to the extent that I can assist the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in the months ahead'' with informal advice. `` I assured the attorney general that he need only call on me,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> wanted to fill the positions vacated by <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> plus the No. 3 spot in the department, that of associate attorney general, before leaving Wednesday on a week-long trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to speak to officials there on drug-related matters. The job that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is to fill is being vacated by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, who was confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month to become a federal appeals court judge. Asked Monday night whether he had any qualms about serving under <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said that `` I look at the job as serving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'' and that the investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` is not dominating my decision.'' In a brief interview today at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said the resignations of last week and the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` were intertwined.'' He refused to be more specific, except to say that `` the pendency of the McKay investigation'' was a factor. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today for the first time since resigning a week ago.

<HEAD>TV May Help Racial Understanding, Howard Beach Study Suggests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A study at one <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> high school found that television may help break down racial and ethnic stereotypes, researchers said Tuesday. The study was conducted at a high school in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, which gained national attention as the site of a racially motivated killing in 1986. `` The good news is that the kids like the ethnic characters on television and they identify with them,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, a political scientist who conducted the study for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bad news is that they like the bad characters too.'' The survey found that black characters are the most popular on television, and that <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Huxtable </PERSON>, portrayed by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> in `` The Cosby Show,'' is the most popular character of all. Both Italian-American students and non-Italians said that Italian characters such as <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Micelli </PERSON> on `` Who's the Boss?'' were most typical of their ethnic group. Jewish students responded the least favorably to ethnic characters across the board, but also were the least likely to view them as realistic portrayals. In general, the study found that the more students liked television characters, the more likely they were to regard them as typical of their racial or ethnic group. <PERSON> Huxtable </PERSON> was one exception: although black students overwhelmingly regarded him as a typical black man, non-blacks were evenly split on whether he was typical. The choice of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was coincidental, <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said. He said he and his wife, sociologist <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, conducted their research several weeks before the 1986 incident in which a group of white youths attacked three black men, one of whom died. The study was co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pluralism </ORGANIZATION>

 Above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall and snowpack are producing conditions in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> reminiscent of the dust bowl weather of the 1930s, state climatologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, chairman of a newly formed governor's committee on drought, commented Tuesday as the panel met here to review weather information and discuss possible water conservation steps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> had the driest February and March on record and has had only .02 inch of rain in more than 2 -LCB- months. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> representatives told the committee that snowpack in the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevadas </ORGANIZATION> is about 25-40 percent of normal and reservoirs in the in northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are at only half their average levels.

<HEAD>White-Band Disease Imperils Coral Reefs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coral reefs are making a rapid recovery from a mysterious illness that bleached them white last summer, marine scientists say, but now those reefs are threatened by another potentially fatal disease. Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said he's worried about the spread of white-band disease, which affects elkhorn coral, the branching type that's common on shallow reefs off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> said he has seen evidence of white-band disease off <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and near the Grecian Rocks off Key Largo. The rocks are on the fringe of a coral reef sanctuary adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennekamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, a spectacular preserve that draws more than a million divers each year. `` In some cases off <LOCATION> Grecian </LOCATION> we were seeing entire colonies that had succumbed to it,'' <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> said of the disease. He said white-band disease appears to be caused by a bacteria. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> said the disease could be getting a foothold in areas where coral has been weakened by turbid water, though that's not always the case. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> found evidence of white-band disease last month while surveying reefs to determine the extent of coral bleaching caused by another sometimes fatal affliction. The study, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, covered reefs off <ORGANIZATION> Biscayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Largo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION>, Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary and at the Eastern Dry Rocks off Key West. He said the coral has made a remarkable comeback from the bleaching illness. `` Only 1 to 2 percent were still severely bleached,'' <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> said. `` They seem to be starting to regain their color. The reefs in the shallow waters are almost back to normal. I think that in another few weeks you'll see most of the coral completely back to normal.'' The bleaching disease struck coral last summer from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Some experts believe the condition was caused by the unusually long period of high sea temperatures last summer, the hottest on record. The temperatures caused the dark algae covering the coral to disappear, whitening the coral. The coral eventually dies because the algae is its source of food. Areas killed by the bleaching phenomenon should restore themselves in two to three years. `` The cooler temperatures have had a beneficial effect. If they are given a reprieve this summer, they'll recover quite well,'' <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> said.

 Haitian Gen. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> tried to import some 900 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a 1986 deal which went awry, a Cuban-American who was involved in the plan told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> commands the most feared <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and is considered one of the leaders of the troubled <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, according to testimony from <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s testimony in heavily accented English was part of the panel's ongoing investigation of drug smuggling from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Earlier Tuesday, a convicted marijuana dealer told the subcommittee that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials were paid to look the other way while huge amounts of marijuana were shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1967, had headed <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based company. He detailed how he became involved with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> two years ago through a business deal offered by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>. She originally interested <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> through an offer to sell him seafood, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> testified, but once he went to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to investigate the deal, it turned into a plan to sent 412 kilograms -LRB- about 906 pounds -RRB- of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The deal fell through when the people hired to fly the cocaine from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Haitian farm to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> stole the drugs, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s henchmen have tried twice to kill him since then, including one attempt that occurred near the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> is now under <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> protection and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been indicted for conspiracy in the case. Also indicted March 10 in the same case was his brother, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, noted that <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s testimony shows `` yet another country ... polluting the streets of our country'' with drugs Previous testimony before the subcommittee has centered on Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations. Earlier, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> testified that marijuana was moved aboard planes as large as a DC-6, along with shrimp boats and _ on one occasion in 1983 _ a barge which carried 150 tons of the drug into a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> port. Law enforcement officials were paid off `` when it had to be done,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. Usually, they were given `` $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 to do nothing,'' he said. `` They were paid to look the other way.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> did not name any of the officials he said received payments. On one occasion in 1979 or 1980, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said, he and several other members of his drug smuggling organization met in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, then that nation's leader, and <PERSON> Manual </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, to discuss using a small island off the Panamanian coast for transshipping drugs. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> was killed in a 1981 plane crash and eventually was succeeded by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been charged in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with involvement in the drug trade. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the charges and is resisting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to push him out of office. The two Panamanians `` were being extremely greedy,'' said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, since they were seeking payoffs of up to $ 100,000 per planeload of drugs. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, 37, pleaded guilty in 1986 to charges arising from his 14-year career as a drug smuggler. He told the subcommittee he is now serving a 12 -LCB- - year prison term <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said he became involved in the drug business while he was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. He brokered a sale for a friend and `` I made a good amount of money and lo and behold, I was off and running.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> told the committee he only dealt in marijuana because `` I have moral problems with cocaine.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> declined to say how much money he had personally made from his drug business, but said the organizations in which he was involved made hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, the barge load of marijuana was worth $ 90 million, and his organization only paid $ 30 million for the drug, meaning a $ 60 million profit, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> described one occasion in 1979 or 1980 in which he said a plane loaded with marijuana was flying from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but had to turn back because the destination was fogged in. The plane's operators dumped their cargo _ bales of marijuana _ by pushing them out the door of the plane while flying over northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in the middle of the night The emergency plan had been to dump the drugs in the the <ORGANIZATION> Chattahoochee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, but instead, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said, he later was told that some of the bales had fallen on the streets of a nearby town. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said he did not know either the name of the town or the exact date of the incident. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said his organization developed detailed, elaborate methods of evading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to halt the drug trade. Those tactics included intelligence collection and electronic countermeasures, he said. In addition, smugglers obtained the frequencies used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for communications, and at one point, they even had the frequency of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, the president's plane.

 A man whose business cards said he had `` poison'' in his head and who organized a community crime watch program had torture devices in his house and a human head buried in his yard, police say. Police worked in a cordoned-off area Tuesday with shovels and a backhoe to dig up <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s back yard, where the head was discovered during the weekend. A human skull also was found in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s house, police said, along with another human skull that appeared to be very old and was discarded as evidence. `` We're investigating the possibility he may be linked to ... unsolved cases of missing persons,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilgrim </PERSON>, a police homicide detective. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s secret life came to light Saturday after a man who police say was held captive and sexually abused by <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> leaped out of a second-story window of <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s house. The man, who had lash marks on his back and was wearing only a dog collar, sought help from neighbors. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> has been charged with nine felonies. Officials said the 22-year-old victim had been held for five days. He was hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday with injuries to his throat and to his eyes from an unknown chemical, officials said. Police said they found photographs in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s brick and wood-frame house that showed people being tortured, including the man who escaped Saturday. The photographs were taken in the house, which had torture and bondage devices, said Sgt. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. He refused to describe the devices. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s neighborhood is in a lower-middle class section of midtown <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with two-story houses, no more than 30 feet apart. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> about 16 years ago. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, a neighbor, said <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> told him about five years ago he was using his home as a half-way house for runaways and that young men often visited the house. `` I thought he was a father figure to those kids and I got adjusted to the fact that there were boys at his house,'' said <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> also organized a neighborhood watch program. `` He led us to believe he was a nice guy, a leader in the community,'' <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. `` He was very active and made us feel like second-class residents because we were not active.'' <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> owned a curio shop called <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s Bazaar Bizarre. Replicas of skulls, faces of dragons and demons as well as ornaments from foreign countries were among the items he sold. His calling card, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, read: `` I rise from death, I kill death, and death kills me. ... Although I carry poison in my head the antidote can be found in my tail, which I bite with rage.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, the father of a missing youth, said he suspected something was wrong almost four years ago. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said his son was last seen with <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> before disappearing in 1984. When <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> appeared for a court hearing Monday, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> lunged at him and had to be restrained. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> pleaded innocent to seven counts of forcible sodomy, one of felonious restraint and one of first-degree assault. He failed to post the $ 500,000 bond.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadus </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearman </PERSON>, a publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who crusaded against gambling in the 1950s, has died. He was 94. <PERSON> Shearman </PERSON> died Monday at home after a long illness. As a result of his crusade against gambling in southwestern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, he and four other newsmen were indicted by a special <LOCATION> Calcasieu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> grand jury on charges they defamed 16 public officials and three admitted gamblers. A special judge appointed to hear the case acquitted the newsmen, saying every allegation made in articles and editorials was without malice and was either true or could reasonably be believed to be true. With legislative help casinos and slot machines were eventually eliminated. In 1977, <PERSON> Shearman </PERSON> was cited in the National Better Newspaper Contest for community service for the newspaper's coverage of labor violence, stemming from a union attack on a construction site in which one man was killed and several people were injured. Legislators cited the newspaper's work as a key to getting the state's right-to-work law passed. <PERSON> Shearman </PERSON> was born June 27, 1893, in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and entered the newspaper business as an advertising salesman for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in 1914. He bought the Lake Charles paper in 1943 and acquired the <LOCATION> Roswell </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Record in 1933 and the Hobbs -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Sun and the <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> -RRB- Chronicle News in 1936. <PERSON> Shearman </PERSON> also was active in the oil and gas business. He is survived by four children and a sister.

<HEAD>Closed Meetings of Recreation Commission Violated Law, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential advisory commission on recreation held 34 closed meetings in violation of the law, congressional investigators said in a report released Tuesday. However, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, also concluded that the violation `` may not have had a material impact on the commission's operations and its final report and recommendations.'' The commission chairman said he never realized so many minor get-togethers like informal lunches would count as `` meetings.'' The 15-member group in question, the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors, was organized in September 1985 under an executive order issued by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and made its report in December 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report appeared to uphold many complaints by a group opposed to the commission's recommendations, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. An `` inholder'' is an owner of private property surrounded by public land, such as the owner of a home in a national park. A lawsuit filed by the group to overturn the report got nowhere when a judge ruled that it could not sue because it had failed to protest when the alleged violations were occuring. The commission was formed as a government advisory committee, which meant that it had to hold its meetings in public with a 15-day notice, a designated federal official had to attend each meeting and detailed minutes had to be kept. Permission had to be sought from the host agency head to close a meeting, and reasons for closing it had to be submitted. `` The -LRB- Interior -RRB- department committee management officer thought that responsibility for -LRB- the act's -RRB- requirements was being handled by the commission, but commission officials were unaware that such a transfer of responsibility had occured,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. As a result, and despite an extensive campaign to generate public advice, the commission published notices for only 18 of its 60 meetings, and only 10 were published in time; proper procedures for closing 34 of the 60 meetings were not followed; minutes were kept for only 27 of 60 meetings and the department employee designated to attend commission meetings attended only 11. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> who was chairman of the commission, said in written comments: `` I did not ever imagine that a ` meeting' could be a lunch among a few of the commission members where no decisions were reached or a staff working session which some commission memebrs briefly attended. If such an unusual definition of ` meeting' is what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> really intended, then perhaps <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials could visit commissions like ours when they begin and say that.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> for policy, budget and administration, wrote that the department was reviewing its procedures and would make sure that similar presidential commissions assigned to it would be served by staff familiar with the law. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the commission `` operated in a vacuum and made silly recommendations'' that it might not have made if the requirements had been met. But <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association, said <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON> `` could not be more wrong. ... We had an extraordinarily open process, and did nothing in camera.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real-estate magnate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed Tuesday to pay a $ 750,000 civil penalty to settle an antitrust lawsuit stemming from his attempted takeovers of <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed to pay the penalty to settle a suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> alleging that his 1986 stock purchases in the two companies violated the notification procedures required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act The law requires that buyers must notify the government before purchasing more than $ 15 million worth of voting stock in a company and wait 30 days before completing the transaction. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> along with the proposed settlement agreement, charged that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> violated the law by failing to notify the government of Holiday stock acquisitions made between Aug. 22, 1986 and Oct. 17, 1986. The complaint also charged that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> committed the same violation when he acquired more than $ 15 million in shares of <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> stock between Nov. 13, 1986 and Dec. 1, 1986. The settlement is the second in two days by the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> involving the so-called `` parking'' of stock with a brokerage house. On Monday, the <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> agreed to pay a $ 400,000 penalty to settle a similar suit arising from its attempt to buy a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Both cases involved the purchase of stock options through <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which, in turn, bought actual shares. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> contends that the subsequent exercise of the stock options was covered by the notification procedures of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In a statement, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he decided to settle the case `` to avoid protracted litigation within the federal government over a highly technical disagreement between the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> and the business community.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said `` I firmly believe that I was in full compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act reporting restrictions.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said `` the most respected lawyers in the business'' told him the law exempted the purchase of stock options. `` Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> also gave me the same assurance,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. `` I assume Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> will reimburse me for the expense.'' A Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> agreed last month to pay a $ 300,000 civil penalty to settle a similar complaint. Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> also served as the broker for <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>USDA Defining Federal Limits on Payments to Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public comments are being sought on how to define a `` person'' for purposes of determining federal limits on payments to farmers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. There are limits on federal payments to individuals, including benefits paid under commodity price support programs, the Conservation Reserve Program and some other programs where direct payments are made. Additionally, the proposed rule would determine whether foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments. In budget legislation late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> included a number of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s farm payment regulations, beginning with 1989 crops. The law provides, for example, that to qualify for payments a `` person'' must be actively engaged in farming by providing a significant amount of capital, equipment or land, and personal labor or management to the enterprise. A basic limit of $ 50,000 per person annually is set on direct deficiency payments, but this can be ballooned to as much as $ 100,000 maximum, depending on a person's interest in other entities. The term `` person'' can include individuals, corporations, associations, charitable organizations or other entity as determined by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. And that's what the rule-making procedure is seeking to determine, the other entities. A recent study by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the law requires the secretary of agriculture `` to give fair and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries thereof, and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and continue to be operated separately.'' Written comments can be sent by May 6 to: Director, Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, ASCS-USDA, P.O. Box 2415, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20013.

 An experienced parachutist filmed his own two-mile death plunge after he fell from an airplane while carrying a video camera but apparently without realizing he had no parachute, investigators said Tuesday. Officials declared the death Saturday of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, an accident. <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said there was no foul play and no indication of suicide, although `` a man who has jumped 800 times ought to remember his parachute.'' The videotape shows <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> leaving the plane, apparently without problems, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Other parachutists then jump and free fall, but disappear when they pop their parachutes and <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> plunges on toward the ground at 150 mph. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, who was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet, was filming a student and an instructor at <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sports Parachute Center about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. The plane's pilot, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Luman </PERSON>, could n't be found for comment and had no telephone listing. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the pilot `` was n't in any position to see what happened in the back of the plane.'' There was no answer Tuesday at the parachute center. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON>, wife of club owner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON> _ who was the instructor on <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'s last jump, was quoted in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Observer as saying: `` No one was aware that he got on the plane without a parachute. Of course no one knew or they would have stopped him.'' The videotape showed the divers making preparations around the plane's door; then the camera went out with <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. With the camera aimed up toward the plane, the tape then shows the instructor and the student jump and freefall somewhat above <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. The jump appeared to be proceeding normally until the instructor and student opened their parachutes and receded rapidly from view as <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> hurtled below them. `` It kind of appears he reached for his parachute and did n't have one,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` But the release for his -LRB- McGuire's -RRB- parachute is on his right hip, and when that right hand goes down, the left hand comes forward and it comes into camera view.'' After several seconds of jerky motion, the tape shows the ground approaching. `` Then the pictures get to moving real fast because he's approaching the ground at 150 mph,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'s body was found in woods about 1 -LCB- miles from the airfield. Footage of the final stage of the plunge was destroyed on impact and what tape remained had to be spliced in places, officials said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said blood samples will show whether <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> had alcohol or drugs in his system and test results should be ready in about a week. Although an expert jumper, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> could have forgotten to put on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video equipment, Mrs. <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON> was quoted as saying. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigator said Monday he was checking to see if the pilot knew whether <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> was wearing a parachute when he entered the airplane, as <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations require. Sheriff <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Tuesday the investigation showed the pilot thought <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> was wearing a parachute. But <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggsbee </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigator, said the video equipment may have been mistaken for a parachute.

<TEXT>
 Following two yellow farm horses temporarily dubbed mules, marchers in a cross-country pilgrimage for the poor stepped off Tuesday from the small motel where <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> died 20 years ago. `` We're trying to stir up the countryside. We're trying to bring people out to express their outrage about poverty,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a civil rights organization founded by King. The combination march and motorcade through <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was scheduled to begin Monday following a memorial service on the 20th anniversary of King's death. The trek was delayed a day, however, because two mules that were to pull a farm wagon on the marching portions of the trip failed to arrive on time. The two animals trucked in for the trip Tuesday turned out to be small yellow work horses but were strapped up to the wagon as the procession got under way. `` Today, they're mules,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said as he climbed aboard the wagon. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> marches often use a mule-drawn wagon as a symbol of poverty. The 30 or so marchers walked about a mile and a half from The Lorraine before loading the wagon on a rental truck, putting the horses on a trailer and climbing aboard three vans for a trip to Marks, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, the first stop on the tour. The group plans to ride in the vans for the rural parts of the trip and stage marches and rallies at towns along the way. The pilgrimage is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on April 29. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said his group will hold several public hearings on the trip for a report on poverty to be given to the Republican and Democratic parties at their conventions this summer. `` Most poor people are working people,'' he said. `` They simply do n't earn enough to carry them out of the pits of poverty.'' In recent years, particularly during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, the nation has lost the urgency it once felt to help the poor, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said `` You're not going to get the private sector, where most jobs are, to respond until you get public policy that encourages them, that requires them and offers the incentives for them to provide job training and job opportunities for those who need it,'' he said. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said the cross-country trek was begun at The Lorraine because King was assassinated there while helping the working poor by leading a strike by sanitation workers. `` We will not let any commemorative service for Dr. King end with a benediction,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` That's why we closed the April 4 event with a pilgrimage as part of the poor people's campaign.''

<HEAD>Report On Election-Day Violence Does Not Pinpoint Responsibility</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A committee appointed to investigate killings that caused the cancellation of national elections said it had identified the assailants `` collectively'' but named no individuals, a radio station reported. More than 30 people were killed on Nov. 29 as gangs of armed men rampaged through the streets of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, shooting at civilians who fled in panic. Police and military units patrolling the capital did not intervene. The election was stopped after the polls had been open for several hours. Government-controlled elections subsequently were held on Jan. 17, but they were boycotted by opposition groups and the voter turnout was low. The military junta in power last fall appointed four civilians and two army officers to determine who was responsible for the Nov. 29 violence and submit a report by Jan. 15. Contents of the report were not made public but <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION>, in a broadcast Monday, gave some details. It said the committee reported it could not identify individuals responsible for the election day violence, or for numerous pre-election killings and cases of arson. But the committee report said it had identified those responsible `` collectively so that the government can prosecute them,'' Radio Metropole said. It did not list any groups. The radio station said the committee report criticized various agencies, saying they had contributed to the collapse of order during the election, which would have been <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free balloting in 30 years. The broadcast said the committee accused the police of not providing adquate security, claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> had not properly informed Haitians about their civic duties and said the courts failed to document the election-day events as required by law. An independent electoral council that organized the balloting failed to accomplish its constitutional mission and allowed `` foreign powers'' to become involved in national affairs, the report said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION>. It said the committee recommended payment of compensation for victims of the violence and their relatives, strengthening the police force and intensified searches for illegal weapons. After the balloting was canceled, the three-member junta dissolved the independent electoral council and appointed its own council to oversee the January election. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected president and installed in office Feb. 7, the second anniversary of former dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s flight to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Shotgun Blasts Blamed on War Over Saturday Car Dealer Openings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The war over Saturday car sales in the heart of the nation's automaking industry is opening up again with shotgun blasts and shattered windows. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>'s suburban <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> dealership lost two 7-by-4 foot panes, apparently for opening on the weekend. `` I would either say it's a couple of -LRB- competing -RRB- salespeople who took it in their own hands or they hired somebody,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, you can hire something done pretty easy with the right contacts.'' The Saturday opening controversy has been bubbling in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for 20 years, and there have been several reports of vandalism. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said his business received a telephone call last week. He quoted a male voice as saying, `` Other salesmen are excited. It's starting off with a bang Measure your glass.'' His dealership has been open on weekends intermittently in recent years, closing each time after incidents of violence or harassment, he said. `` We come out and retreat,'' he said. He resumed the Saturday hours about six months ago, but did n't begin advertising the weekend hours until a month ago `` It's getting around that it was n't a short-term deal,'' he said. `` We're going to sell cars, even if -LRB- other dealerships -RRB- are not. They did n't like that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has taken no formal stand on the Saturday sales issue, said <ORGANIZATION> DADA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. He said he did n't know how many of the association's approximately 240 members are open on weekends but said those were in a small minority <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is the only major market he knows of where dealerships are closed Saturdays. `` I'm not trying to be a hero,'' said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>, who opened Key Motor Mall in 1965. `` I'm not overjoyed to pay for glass. I'm not trying to be a cause, either.'' But <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said his business needs all the help it can get. `` To cover my overhead, I'll do anything it takes to sell a car,'' he said. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> estimated that car sales on a normal Saturday amount to about half of any single weekday's sales. But a few good Saturdays in a row can turn loss into profit. `` If we can pick up a half-dozen -LRB- sales -RRB- a weekend, that's 25 a month, it can be a difference between us being profitable or being at a loss,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said. Key employees reporting to work Thursday found two shattered glass panes and two others riddled with birdshot. Police discovered evidence that five or six shots had been fired. No one was injured and no one, including the dealership's overnight security guards, heard shots, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said The guards were at the back of the property, keeping an eye on the 300 cars <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> keeps in stock. In 1981 and 1982, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> said, cars on his lot suffered about $ 300,000 in damage caused by vandalism, ranging from interiors being set on fire to body paint being badly scratched. No one has been arrested in any of the incidents. Last July, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Timony </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> turned aside government charges that <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> auto dealers illegally conspired to close showrooms on weekends and most weeknights. <PERSON> Timony </PERSON> said the agreement to limit hours stemmed from a labor dispute dating to 1959, when dealers agreed to close on weekends to keep salesmen from joining labor organizations in the heavily unionized <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. Since it was a labor dispute, the judge said, it was exempt from antitrust action. A veteran salesman at another Detroit-area dealership that is closed on weekends said most weekend customers are `` tire kickers'' interested mainly in browsing. `` When I first got in this business -LRB- in 1967 -RRB-, we were open on Saturdays and, quite frankly, business was pretty good,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said from <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>. `` Then it just died. `` We said to each other, ` Hey, guys, we're not paid by the hour. We just sit here and talk to each other. It's kind of silly,''' <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> closed on weekends after he and other salespeople picketed to protest weekend hours. `` I like spending time with my family. If they went to a six-day work week, I'd quite frankly look for another line of work,'' said <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>.

 With the flick of a tail and the wave of a claw, two huge lobsters were freed Monday in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour of the Northeast. `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>,'' a 25-pound male lobster, and `` Bob,'' his 19 -RCB- - pound companion, went down into the sea off foggy <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Head Light They had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept before their release. `` They were real frisky,'' <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` They put a quahog -LRB- a large clam -RRB- in there and the big one just snapped it up like it was butter. They left a crab in there overnight and it was gone this morning.'' The two behemoths almost became a very expensive Easter dinner in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> before an unlikely combination of animal rights activists, seafood dealers and state officials came to the rescue. A 30-minute boat ride from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> marked a storybook ending to the rescue mission. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuts </PERSON>, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, had the honor of putting the monster crustaceans into the water. Neuts grabbed <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s baseball mitt-sized claws and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> took the tail, and the two gently lowered the lobster over the side of the 35-foot <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> boat. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> went into the same protected cove moments later. The two men who make their living from selling seafood agreed it seemed strange to be returning it to the sea, but in the case of <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> they had no complaints. `` It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. `` I like the idea of the whole thing.'' `` These are well-traveled lobsters,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. With his wife, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON>, he accompanied the two lobsters on their flight Monday from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We should n't be catching lobsters this size. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> is the only state that's doing anything to protect them, and that's why we're here,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds. It is the only state with a legal limit on the maximum size of lobsters. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old, and the smaller companion were rescued from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> man who wanted to serve them for Easter dinner. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said the lobsters had apparently gotten snagged in the nets of a dragger and were landed in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 A senior official said Tuesday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is pushing ahead with plans for speedy delivery of humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contras, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> claim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the rebels would be illegal. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said plans are being prepared for air drops of the food and other aid approved for the rebels last week by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The temporary cease-fire agreement signed by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and the Contras allows for deliveries of humanitarian aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> acknowledged at a news conference that Sandinista cooperation is required and said the issue is being discussed between government and rebel negoitators. `` We would strongly hope that the Nicaraguan government would be sensitive ... and prepare to allow humanitarian assistance _ food, medical supplies, clothing and shelter _ to move without interruption,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. But Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package that was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> illegal, saying `` we can not accept any type of aid to the Contras because it would be legitimizing the interventionist policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said preparations are being made for deliveries to rebels deployed outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ presumably in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ within the next few days. Contras based inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will receive aid once they move to cease-fire enclaves agreed to in ongoing negotiations. The $ 49.7 million aid package calls for $ 17.7 million to be sent to the Contras and a similar amount to be allocated to help children who are war victims. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said private contractors will be hired to carry out shipments to the rebels by air, while private voluntary organizations are being contacted to send experts trained to help children in need. He said AID will abide by a provision in the <LOCATION> Sandinista-Contra </LOCATION> agreement that only `` neutral organizations'' be allowed to take part in delivery of the assistance.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Bases in Philippines Needed In Face Of Soviet Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American envoy at the opening of talks on the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> said Tuesday the facilities are needed in the face of a Soviet buildup. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the six bases, where about 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and defense workers are stationed, are critical to security in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Many Filipinos have called for an end to the garrisons, which they see as a vestige of colonialism. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in the region has remained constant, the `` Soviet military presence has grown from an essentially zero base to one of substantial proportions.'' `` It only requires an overnight shift in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intentions, given their current capability, to transform this presence into a serious economic and military threat to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and to the region,'' he added. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials are reviewing a 1947 agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> operates the bases, the last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. They technically are under command of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but are effectively controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As the talks got under way at a seaside convention complex in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, about 500 people staged a peaceful march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> protesting the bases. Eight imprisoned communist rebels issued a statement demanding the bases be closed. The government has been fighting a 19-year war against communist guerrillas. Spokesmen for the two countries said Tuesday's closed-door meeting was devoted to drawing up an agenda and agreeing on procedures for the talks, which are expected to last three months. The leases for the bases expire in 1991. Under the new <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> constitution, a lease extension must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. Philippine negotiators were expected to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for an increase in the $ 180 million <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> receives each year for the bases. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> indicated <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would resist such demands. `` For decades, we have borne the main financial burden for the defense of the free nations,'' he said. `` Now, the resulting serious deficits and imbalances must be addressed as a matter of top priority.'' He said the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases allows the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to use its resources on economic development and battle the communist rebels. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> also predicted more foreign investment in the country if the bases remain. Philippine officials have said they also will press for information on whether the installations, which include the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> air and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> naval bases and four smaller facilities, are used to store or transport nuclear weapons. The new constitution states that the country opposes such weapons `` consistent with the national interests.'' Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the talks will be held in an atmosphere `` of candor and friendship,'' but suggested the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> negotiators will be sensitive to growing opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not said if she supports an extension of the leases.

A senior Israeli defense official said Monday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might be nudged into acting on the plan if <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> accepts it in principle. Among points at issue is how negotiations on Palestinian self-rule, which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hopes will begin May 1, would link with talks on a final settlement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would like the second stage to begin in December. He will take answers from the Israelis to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> later Wednesday after a stop in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to see President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't report any particular sense of convergence on the intiative at this point,'' the secretary told reporters on his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet. `` People are raising questions and expressing reservations.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> added, however: `` We continue to think what has been put forward is basically what can potentially work, so we stick with it.'' All sides urged him to continue in his effort for negotiations, he declared, but `` I do n't want to give any big plus sign because that would not be warranted by the facts.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> are prepared to negotiate with the Arabs on an overall settlement but `` there are all sorts of questions'' on the Israeli side, including a connection between Palestinian self-rule and talks on an overall agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet is deadlocked over whether to accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> leads those holding out, while <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> favor it. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> met for 75 minutes, then had lunch. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the secretary spent two hours and 45 minutes with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and said they had `` sharply different'' views on how to hold the negotiations. `` We think we made a reasonable amount of headway'' however, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. April <PERSON> Glaspie </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Jordan-Lebanon-Syrian desk, remained in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for further discussions In an interview with Jordanian newspaper editors in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ruled out participation in peace talks by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` How do you talk to someone who says we want to exterminate you -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-?'' he asked. He also said: `` We do n't think an independent Palestinian state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> makes sense.'' The interview was videotaped but not shown on early evening news programs by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s state-run television network. A senior government source said privately the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> comments were considered `` very much pro-Israeli.'' Jordanian television usually can be seen in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have been torn by four months of violence. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had not dropped his insistence that talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be held at a peace conference in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would take active roles. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> prefers direct negotiations with the Arabs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made clear in the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> interview that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> partricipation in peace talks is impossible until it accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounces terrorism. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is here. It's here to stay,'' he said. Several of the editors questioned whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be a fair mediator between Arabs and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The secretary said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a friend of both sides.

 A day after he was convicted and removed from office by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Tuesday he is doing fine but has not decided whether he will try to get his job back. However, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> warned that those who ousted him may not realize they have `` awakened a sleeping giant'' in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> electorate. `` I know that they are aroused, I know that they are incensed, I know that they are right down angry,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican convicted in an impeachment trial that ended Monday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> _ who described himself as the `` recent former governor'' _ appeared relaxed as he spoke to a <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and said, `` I have no rancor in my heart for anybody.'' He was removed from office Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of obstructing justice and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund `` I have n't yet determined what my course will be,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` I have n't yet said that I'm not going to be a candidate in the recall.'' Earlier, in a telephone interview from his surburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> home, he said, `` I'm doing fine. ... I've got a clear conscience and I have n't done anything wrong.'' `` This job was n't the end of the world for me; I did n't need it in the first place,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. Several weeks ago, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him, he might go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to claim that his rights had been violated. He said Tuesday he had not decided whether he will do so. Two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ Republican Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> _ said there was talk among senators about reconsidering their vote against excluding <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from holding office again. The two said they opposed reopening the issue when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> meets Wednesday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. If convicted, he would be barred from holding office again. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KTAR </ORGANIZATION> radio he does not believe <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> can run in the May 17 recall because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removed him from the four-year term he began in January 1987. `` My understanding is that he can not run again until 1990,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The recall election remained scheduled despite the vote removing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office and the installation of Democrat Rose Mofford, the secretary of state who until Monday was acting governor. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told the Kiwanis group he expects lawmakers and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> to adopt a 10 percent tax increase to make up for a 1988-89 budget deficit estimated at $ 349 million. Such a tax hike is unnecessary, he said, although in January <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> proposed a `` tax equity'' plan that amounted to a $ 90 million hike. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he disagreed with Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s decision to sign legislation allowing a second weekly lottery game and another measure allowing new state buildings to be funded through lease-purchase. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he planned to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to require the state to pay <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney fees, which <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said were `` in the range of $ 300,000.'' Officials still must decide what to do with the protocol fund, which <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said is in the bank. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s auto dealership repaid the $ 80,000 loan that was the subject of one impeachment charge.

 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> charged Tuesday that the other presidential candidates have not challenged <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position on vital issues for fear of being labeled as racist `` We have seen the other candidates, up until now, dance around <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and the media dance around <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as though they were afraid they were either going to insult him or his supporters,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` I think it would insult him and his supporters by not treating him equally.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> maintained that the other presidential candidates have been afraid to insult <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the black candidate, or his supporters by questioning his positions on aid to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and on cutting back on defense in favor of vast social programs. Although <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` the smartest of all those guys running,'' he maintained that this did n't mean he'd make the best president. `` But, he knows how to answer. He can defend himself,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` He does n't need presidential security from questions. And so when the candidates would n't take him on, and the media would n't take him on, I decided I would. The mayor was critical of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> last Friday saying Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for him since he embraced <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s domestic social programs would `` break the bank'' in three weeks, and his proposed defense cutbacks would leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` defenseless'' in six weeks. `` It seems to me everybody who's running for president ought to be subject, with respect to their public behavior and their public statements and their philosophy, under a microscope,'' the mayor said. `` Are n't you patronizing <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by saying he shall be spared from having to defend his positions?'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said when asked if he had had any backlash from his criticism of the Democratic candidate. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` I encourage everybody to speak the truth as they know it. I encourage <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to respond. I encourage <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to say where are we wrong and also to point out the infirmities, the moats, if you will, in the eyes of the other candidates. I encourage that debate.'' `` Remember,'' he added, `` we're electing a president. This is not a matter of silence. Silence today is not golden. Silence today is chicken!''

 In a half-acre building, for sale to the highest bidder, are many of <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s luxurious possessions _ mirrored pianos, furs, classic cars and glittery memorabilia. `` It is really sad. We would all rather have <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> here,'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said Tuesday during a preview of the Liberace Collection. `` There's a little bit of something for everyone.'' The sale, with items accumulated for decades by the late entertainer, runs Saturday through Tuesday. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, a pianist without peer who symbolized extravagance and outlandish dress, died Feb. 4, 1987, at age 67 from complications caused by acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A Convention Center hall was packed with more than 2,000 treasures, including mirrored <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> pianos, furs, classic cars and furnishings from <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, home, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> penthouse, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment, <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> house and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> estate.

 Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> signed a controversial resolution Tuesday requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the Capitol, but said the flag pole would remain empty until he knows which Confederate flag to display. During debate on the bill, black legislators urged colleagues not to adopt the resolution, saying the Confederate flag was an offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>'s announcement came at a news conference the day after the author of the resolution, state Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, said he would refuse the governor's request to recall the bill and change it. In asking for the recall, <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> said the bill did not stipulate which of the three flags used by the Confederacy from 1861 to 1865 should be flown. <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON> said Monday the resolution was written so <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> `` could fly the flag that is the least offensive.'' But <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` If I chose any one of the three I'm going to be criticized for it. The flag has sparked controversy in several other Southern states recently. Opponents say the Confederate flag is a symbol of oppression; supporters say it is historic, not a racial symbol. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the state flag, which incorporates the design of the Confederate banner, and in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, black lawmakers were arrested for trying to remove a Confederate flag from the Capitol dome. For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until 1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps. The display was removed during recent reconstruction and Office of Public Affairs Director <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said she did not plan to have it restored. <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON> then introduced the resolution to require the flag display be resurrected. The flag display represents the countries that have claimed a portion of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> territory in the past, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> has said the existence of the Confederacy and its control over a portion of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> are undisputed facts, and the display is in historical context.

 The first of an extra 1,300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops arrived Tuesday to increase security for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and citizens during <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political and economic crisis. A C-141 Starlifter carrying the first contingent of soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, landed at 4:30 p.m. -LRB- 5:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Nearly 50 flights are expected by the time the deployment is finished Friday. Reinforcements and a squadron of 26 helicopters are intended by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as a signal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the de facto ruler <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been urging to step down. The buildup, ordered last week to counter what the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` heavy-handed tactics,'' will raise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength along the 50-mile-long <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to 11,800 officers and men. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands the 15,000-member Defense Forces. The reinforcements were sent after reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were harassed by Panamanian soldiers and the brief arrests of several American reporters during a police raid on opposition headquarters in a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has repeatedly accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of preparing to invade. The first flight was from Pope Air Force Base, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Officials said they expected at least one heavy cargo plane each hour from <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. A statement from the office of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic archbishop, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, said the government told him it would hold discussions with the opposition, mediated by <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> was asked to mediate by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and former Presidents <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The civilian government, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls, has accused <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of siding with the opposition. State-run newspapers have called the archbishop, who was born in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a `` tool of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>.'' Police halted two opposition demonstrations before they started Tuesday, sealing off the site of one and appearing in force at a park where another was to take place. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no plans to send more forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but `` would not eliminate that possibility.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions imposed in February have produced the gravest economic crisis in the history of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. Banks closed more than a month ago the government has been unable to pay its employees. Tuesday's editions of government newspapers carried a statement from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ridiculing the new American troops and calling them potential AIDS carriers. It said tests by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel have `` a high rate'' of infection with the aquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. `` Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with these soldiers,'' the statement said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said it does not test military personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began doing so in 1985 and reported these figures Sept. 30, at the end of the 1987 fiscal year: 5,890 tests positive in a total of 3.96 million, including 3,336 positive among 2.18 on active duty. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had about 600 security people among its 10,000 personnel before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration stepped up its campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> early last month. In mid-March, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sent 670 more security personnel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help protect military facilities. The primary task of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to safeguard the canal until it is handed over by treaty to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government Dec. 31, 1999. About 13,000 military dependents also live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, along with 1,300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and their 2,600 dependents. On Monday night, <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents Monday night surrounded the home of <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s chief opponents. They remained there Tuesday. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, an aide who was in the house, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was not at home. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two weeks ago from a month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He had been refused permission to return from a business trip Feb. 25. On that day, federal courts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> unsealed grand jury indictments charging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with drug trafficking and money laundering. The following day, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s figurehead president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, tried to fire the general as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander but lost his own job instead.

 Gunmen laughed and screamed `` Kill everyone you can!'' as they massacred 28 villagers at a rural Easter festival, newspapers in the capital reported Tuesday. The hooded killers shot dead an elderly, one-legged man as he struggled to get on the donkey and flee, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified survivor as saying. A 10-year-old boy, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, who was among those ordered to lie face down in the dirt and not look up, was shot in the head at point-blank range by one of the killers when he lifted his head, another survivor was quoted as telling an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> reporter. One other child, a 14-year-old boy, was also killed in the Sunday bloodbath. There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded, ranging from 10 to 15. A death toll of 33 given Monday was revised downward to 28 Tuesday by Gov. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzur </PERSON> of northwest <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> state. The governor said police and the army suspect the massacre was the work of leftist guerrillas, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. However, the murders had all the earmarks of the work of a right-wing death squad. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, sent reporters to the scene, a thatched roof hut in remote mountains where about 200 people were celebrating the end of Holy Week. The area, know as <LOCATION> Mejor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Esquina </LOCATION>, lies 280 miles west of the capital city of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and has about 50 families, with no house closer than 1,500 feet to its neighbor. Here is what happened, according to the accounts given reporters: The traditional partying started Saturday afternoon, with an eight-piece band of guitars and accordions playing the songs dear to Colombian peasants _ ballads of hard-working cowboys, lost love and happiness amid poverty A pig was slaughtered for the feast and chickens were killed. Sunday started off with horse races. In the afternoon there was a dance for the children in the small farmhouse made of mud bricks. Women cooked stew in huge pots throughout the afternoon and the men drank beer and aguardiente, a Colombian liquor with a faint taste of licorice. In the evening, the peasants danced and shouted to each other over music blaring from large speakers. Only a few noticed vehicles park about 150 feet away with lights out. Some people said there were about 10 gunmen. Others said there were as many as 20. Some said they wore military jungle clothing. Others said they wore police uniforms. One thing all survivors agreed on was the gunmen laughing crazily as they fired repeatedly into the crowd amid shouts, screams, the hysterical crying of children. Some people ran into the hut, and gunmen followed, firing as they entered. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Llorente </PERSON> said he survived because the bodies of dead friends lay atop him as the killers fired into the room. No one in the band was killed. One gunman smashed an accordion and whacked the musician across his backside with the flat part of a 2-foot-long machete. The shooting lasted about 20 minutes and the gunmen became more selective in choosing victims. Eight people were shot in the back of the head as they lay face down in the hut. The gunmen left, warning survivors to keep their faces in the dirt for five minutes. `` Then you can look up and cry over what you find, you sons of bitches!'' one attacker shouted. That is when the 10-year-old boy was shot for lifting his head. The sound of the vehicles died out and the village was filled with the groans of the wounded, cries of people calling for loved ones, the agonized whinnying of injured horses. The next day, in nearby <LOCATION> Planeta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, someone painted on a wall, `` The Magnificient Ones are here to clean things up.'' There are a dozen right-wing death squads in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with names like the Vampires and the Crickets. This the first time the Magnificient Ones had been heard of. Death squads have killed about 600 people in the last three years. The left says the army is behind killings. The army denies it. The government says it has been unable to find out who organizes the death squads. So far no one from any death squad has been caught. Leftist guerrillas draw combatants from rural areas, and <ORGANIZATION> Mejor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esquina </ORGANIZATION> may have been one of them. At the school, a guerrilla slogan _ Long live the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ has been painted near the entrance. The schoolmaster, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilches </PERSON>, was among those killed.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Condemns Foreign Interference In Ethnic Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> lashed out Tuesday at foreigners he said were trying to aggravate an ethnic dispute in the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. `` They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs, to exacerbate problems from the outside and -LRB- are -RRB- engaging in provocations,'' he said. `` At present this is particularly visible in connection with the events around <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.'' His comments were similar to recent remarks in the official press condemning purported outside interference in the dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that Armenians want attached to their republic. The Soviet leader's remarks came at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and a former chancellor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported on the meeting. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> singled out broadcasters for criticism. `` Various radio stations, including official ones, have joined in the subversive activity,'' he said. `` Especially active ... is <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- West German radio -RRB-.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say how the radio stations were purportedly being subversive, but other Soviet reports have accused Western journalists of sharpening tensions between Armenians and Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, `` We will handle problems that have accumulated, including on the nationalities issue, within the framework of the democratic process we have firmly chosen.'' Soviet newspapers reported Tuesday that four businesses have gone bankrupt in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, because of a strike but that workers have been returning to their jobs in increasing numbers. The first reports that workers were returning to their jobs came Friday. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that workers were continuing to go back to work to their jobs because of repeated appeals by Communist authorities. Workers began striking in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> on March 24 to protest government refusal to turn the city and the surrounding region, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, over to the Armenian republic. Most of the region's 160,000 residents are ethnic Armenians but since 1923 it has been part of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, announced a plan on March 23 for $ 690 million in economic, social and culture improvements for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which some Armenians say has suffered under the control of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said that in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> on Tuesday, all workers of the building materials plant showed up as did more than half of the employees of the electrical engineering works and silk mill. About a third of the workers of the shoe and furniture factories reported for work, it said. The annexation issue touched off demonstrations and strikes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> on Feb. 13, and the unrest spread to the Armenian captial, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. The dispute led to ethnic rioting Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> that left at least 32 people dead.

 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader in exile, said Tuesday he may be willing to meet Chinese leaders in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to discuss the future of his homeland. `` I feel the more time goes on, there may be more room to develop human understanding,'' he said in a television interview. `` We need more patience, more determination. I am trying to find some way, a middle way, or some kind of compromise.'' `` If circumstances really became more favorable and more positive, I would have no hesitation to go'' to the Chinese capital to discuss Tibetan independence, he told <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial Channel 4 network. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> arrived Monday on a 12-day private visit.

He said Monday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government had asked him to refrain from making political statements during his visit, which he said will be mainly devoted to <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> teaching Published reports have suggested <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not want to upset <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the period leading up to the transfer of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> colony to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of the nation for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region in 1950. Many Tibetans resent the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government because of opression of Tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of temples during the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution in 1966-76.

<TEXT>
 A jury deliberated a second day Tuesday without deciding the fate of 13 people, nine of them accused of conspiring to violently overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and establish an Aryan nation. At midafternoon, the jury asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> for a trial transcript. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> sent jurors a note saying a transcript would be about 7,000 pages and would not be ready for three or four months. He told jurors that recordings of long portions of testimony could not be played for them and they should rely on their memory and notes. The jury was to resume deliberations Wednesday. The case went to the jury on Monday, after a trial that began Feb. 16 and included 192 witnesses. Defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that the trial is a move by the government to snuff out views that do not meet its approval. He said he expects to be acquitted, but added, `` In any case, they win _ they break us financially.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and defendants <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are considered among the leaders of the white-supremacist movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One of <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, said acquittal would slow the movement more than a guilty verdict because it would show that white supremacists `` can get a fair trial in American courts. If acquittal comes back in this case, it will go a long way toward neutralizing the right wing. If they're convicted, the right wing will think they've been shanghaied.'' Besides the nine people accused of seditious conspiracy, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine, five defendants are accused of conspiring to kill federal officials and two of transporting stolen money across state lines. The murder plot could be punished by life imprisonment; the transporting charge by a term of 10 years plus a $ 10,000 fine. A key government witness was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who is serving 20 years for racketeering. He led a white-supremacist group named the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. His group carried out bombings in furtherance of a conspiracy, he testified, that was made in July 1983 at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, at a convocation of <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s group, the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Defendants at that meeting have said that there was no conspiracy and that <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> made up the story in hopes of getting a sentence reduction.

<TEXT>
 The search for three killers who escaped from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Penitentiary focused for hours Tuesday on what turned out to be a false sighting at a restaurant, state police said. `` At first check, it seemed to be them,'' said state police Sgt. D.E. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` But after further checks, we could n't make a positive I.D. `` We retraced all the people who saw them. They were n't the three,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said, adding that the investigative effort had taken six hours. State police had said four workers at a fast food restaurant in Cross Lanes, 11 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and about 170 miles south of the prison, had made a positive identification of the escapees based on mug shots. Convicted murderers <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> used stolen bolt cutters in their Sunday night escape from the <LOCATION> Moundsville </LOCATION> prison. Earlier, a prison official blamed the escape on antiquated facilities and the need to use inmate labor. Corrections Commissioner A.V. <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON> said at least one of the escapees was probably familiar with `` every nook and cranny'' of the 122-year-old prison, which <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON> says can be kept running only with the help of the inmates. As a result, he said, inmates often become familiar with the institution's weaknesses. `` This prison is in terrible shape. The plumbing is especially bad. It needs constant renovation,'' <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, 45, was convicted of robbing and killing a grocer in 1973. At the time, <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> had escaped from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison and also was wanted in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on armed robbery charges. `` <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> was the ringleader,'' <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON> said. `` He is an excellent plumber and probably knew every nook and cranny.'' <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, 35, was convicted of killing one police officer and accused of shooting another. Authorities said he had sworn revenge on those who had put him behind bars. Police have assigned protection to those who helped convict <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, including the judge in his case and a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, woman who testified against him. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 28, was serving a life sentence for felony murder, arson and robbery. <PERSON> Dodrill </PERSON> said authorities are trying to determine whether the three were aided in their escape by correctional officers. `` That possibility does exist,'' the commissioner said. The last escape from <LOCATION> Moundsville </LOCATION> was in February 1983, when two inmates climbed over a wall behind the prison. They were recaptured within 24 hours. In 1979, 15 inmates, including convicted cop killer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, escaped from the massive, stone block prison, killing an off-duty state trooper who was driving past. All 15 eventually were recaptured.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda on Tuesday denounced Soviets who are nostalgic for dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule and say <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are damaging socialism Pravda also lashed out at publications that praise Stalinism and said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` glasnost'' policy of more openness on some issues does not include criticizing principles of the economic reforms the Soviet leader calls `` perestroika.'' `` We need disputes helping to advance perestroika and leading to the consolidation of forces and cohesion around perestroika rather than to disunity,'' Pravda said in a full-page, unsigned editorial. It said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> needs people dedicated to improving housing, food supplies and services rather than those obsessed with uncovering suspected enemies of socialism. `` A patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged ` internal threat' to socialism, who, joining with a few political extremists, seeks internal enemies everywhere,'' Pravda said. `` A patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country, of the people, without fear of any difficulty.'' In a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting Tuesday with <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and former chancellor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged that his reforms have generated controversy. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as saying, `` There are people who think everything is collapsing. Just as in the beginning of this century ` matter vanished' in the perceptions of some people as a result of new discoveries in physics, now it seems to some that socialism is vanishing.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that what is really happening is that socialism `` is ridding itself of everything that had deformed it in the past and is demonstrating tremendous dynamism, the wealth of its social and humanistic content.'' Pravda's editors said they felt compelled to address the issue of Stalinism because another newspaper had raised it improperly. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, official daily of the Russian republic's party and government, carried a letter from a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher who defended <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> It was published March 13, just before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and his chief of propaganda, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavovlev </PERSON>, went to <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. In the past year, Soviet publications have criticized the excesses of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ruled for three decades and died in 1953. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in November the dictator's guilt for the purges in which millions died was `` enormous and unforgivable,'' but defended <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s policies of rapid industrialization and collectivizating of agriculture. The Pravda editorial appeared to be an attempt to draw the party line on Stalinism. It repeated criticisms of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> but said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s opponents wo n't let the issue rest, either because they feel more comfortable with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repression or because it would serve their own interests. `` In one person this may be directed at taking more and giving less, in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts to claim a monopoly in science, personal innocence or something else,'' the paper said. Pravda criticized the system under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as `` thoughtless execution of orders and suppression of initiative.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not hide from the fact that `` many thousands'' of party workers, economic and military officials, scientists and cultural figures were exiled or killed, it said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched his effort to restructure Soviet society three years ago, and Pravda said there are those who feel widespread changes could undermine the Soviet system. `` Not all realize fully that the administrative-command methods have exhausted themselves,'' it said. `` All who pin hopes on those methods or their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact that we have had that more than once, but it did not bring about the desired results.'' People should `` get rid of the nostalgia for the past, when some people said things and others were supposed to heed and uncomplainingly fulfill the orders,'' Pravda advised. It said statements in the letter published by <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> are `` an attempt, little by little, to revise party decisions.'' `` At meetings at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it has been said more than once that the Soviet press is not a private shop and that the Communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware of their responsibility for the articles and the publications,'' it declared. `` In this case the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, which has.. done much for perestroika, has departed from this principle.''

More than 150 groups and people became involved in the project to honor <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>.

The seat is 28 inches off the ground and 28 inches deep.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the chair was very comfortable. `` This day is just incredible. I ca n't believe how much this thing snowballed,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` It's nice to know that there are people here who think so much about me.''

<TEXT>
 Feuding Moslems and Christians joined in a nationwide strike Tuesday to demand 300 percent wage increases to counter inflation and the economic chaos brought on by 13 years of civil war. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, rival Moslem factions engaged in a gun battle that left one man killed and four wounded. Police said the fight near the town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> was between the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. They said Amal militiamen had raided several villages and rounded up 10 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members in a search for gunmen who fired at the car of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s militia commander in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Faqih </PERSON>, on Monday. Police said <PERSON> Faqih </PERSON> was not in the car at the time. The one-day general strike was the latest in a series of demonstrations that began nearly two years ago to protest the economic situation. Banks, schools, shops, gasoline stations, government offices and other businesses closed in both Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and cities and towns throughout the country. But some Lebanese were sceptical. `` We've tried this before and nothing happened,'' said <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohsali </PERSON>, an employee at a pastry shop in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The General Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 300,000 members, said <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport, hospitals, pharmacies, bakeries and newspapers were exempt from the strike. In 1975, when the civil war began, the annual inflation rate was 9 percent. It is now 225 percent. The Lebanese pound, once the soundest currency in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, exchanged at 2.5 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar before the civil war and the rate last week was 360 per dollar. The pound's collapse sent prices soaring in a country that imports more than 85 percent of its needs. In its strike call, the labor confederatin said Tuesday's action was a warning and an indefinite work stoppage would begin April 15 if the demand for the 300 percent increase, retroactive to January, was not met. A government source, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said Cabinet ministers were considering a compromise that would approve wage increases but they would be limited to 100 percent.

<HEAD>Official Denies China Reducing Number Of Overseas Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An education official on Tuesday denied reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will drastically reduce the number of students it allows to study overseas, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinbai </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who is in charge of Chinese students abroad, called the reports groundless, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a long-standing policy of sending students abroad and the policy had not changed and `` will never change.'' He said the numbers of both state-financed and privately financed students were expected to stay the same. According to <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, the government has sent about 3,000 students abroad each year since 1980. The number sent by their employers or by academic institutions has increased steadily and in 1987 topped 5,000, he said. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> estimated that an additional 3,000 students are financing their own overseas education. Since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began sending students overseas in 1979 as part of its general opening to the outside world, more than 40,000 state-funded students have gone to study in 70 countries, <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said according to <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last summer announced new regulations tightening controls on students going abroad and said they must be `` ideologically and morally sound.'' Many of the students have not returned home because of better jobs and living conditions overseas. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said 20,000 students have completed their studies abroad and returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Of the other 20,000 state-funded students still overseas, 10,000 are studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. News reports said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 27,000 Chinese students, 10,000 paying their own way and 7,000 on scholarships. Some students who returned from abroad have said their skills and knowledge are not put to full use in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and they have trouble readjusting to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rigid political and social norms. Recent Western news reports said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> changed its overseas study policy, cutting the number of students going abroad to 3,000. Some reports said only 600 new students would be allowed to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was concerned that students were becoming too Americanized and were bringing back capitalist and bourgeois attitudes. `` It is utterly groundless to say that the numbers of students to be sent abroad, particularly those sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, shall be cut substantially,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said. He said 4,600 state-funded students would be sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. But <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said some adjustments were made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s study-abroad program. Under the new guidelines, students in applied fields of study are more likely to be sent overseas, and more students will be sent to countries where there are few Chinese students already studying. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also will cut back the number of undergraduate and graduate students going overseas and send abroad more scholars engaged in advanced research, <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said.

 Police using helicopters raided Tuesday the luxurious home of a Honduran wanted on drug trafficking charges and then turned him over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody, his lawyer and American officials said. Authorities did not give details of the predawn arrest of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, 43. He has lived openly in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since escaping in 1986 from a Colombian prison, where he was held on charges of involvement with the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. `` This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on illegal drug trafficking,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Honduran government sources said privately that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> met with top civilian and security officials to discuss the case of <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Tuesday that <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been taken into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody. Spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was at an undisclosed location `` in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jurisdiction'' and would be taken to a federal prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` before dawn -LRB- Wednesday -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> `` was placed on a commercial airliner destined for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at approximately 7 p.m. EDT.'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities also want to question him about the death of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent who was kidnapped, tortured and killed in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is believed to have become a leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of illegal drugs from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s lawyer, said in a telephone interview about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at his client's home at 5:45 a.m. He claimed <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, as a Honduran citizen, could not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` because the constitution forbids it.'' Asked later Tuesday about <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> being in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody, the lawyer said: `` I do n't know anything yet, but if <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is found in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that's a kidnapping, not an extradition, because he is a Honduran and protected by the political constitution.'' A source at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said extradition was legal and `` our government maintains its position of taking <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> to our country, where he will face trial in five courts for drug trafficking.'' <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was taken to a special police facility at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Venta </LOCATION>, 12 miles east of the capital. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities link <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to an increase in transshipment of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cocaine through this Central American country. Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduran military officials. The government denied the reports in February. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said critics were trying `` to discredit the armed forces and my government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug traffickers.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in February he makes his living in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $ 2 billion, but he puts it at about $ 5 million. He said the charges against him were `` a lie, a story,'' and claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap him. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> said then he never again would leave <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If I appear in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is a kidnapping by American agents. If I am killed, it is the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said at the time. It apppeared that after fleeing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> he went to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> but was expelled after officials determined he was wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said this expulsion was based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant for <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> after he escaped from <ORGANIZATION> Elgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1971. He was serving a five-year sentence for illegally entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and using a fraudulent visa. Warrants charge him with escape from federal custody, conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute coccaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other charges.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> narrowly lost the votes of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s blue collar workers to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and attracted only a quarter of the white vote, exit polls said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew huge crowds at strike sites and hard-pressed manufacturing communities in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but that enthusiasm did not translate into primary votes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> solidly among white blue collar workers and edged him in that category with blacks included, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 41 percent of blue collar Democratic voters, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said, to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 37 percent. Among white blue-collar voters only, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 47 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 27 percent. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s numbers were similar, with 43 percent of the overall blue collar vote going for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 37 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. As in previous contests, the black vote went overwhelmingly for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Among whites, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 23 percent support while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> put the figure slightly higher at 28 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won just 7 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls said he won 22 percent in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> last week and 32 percent in liberal <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on March 1. Said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>: `` We may be looking at his ceiling here.'' `` We're seeing a dual electorate: a black electorate and a white electorate,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does extremely well among blacks and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does substantially well among whites.'' Electability may have been an issue, with two-thirds of all Democrats saying they think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the presidential nominee, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> found. Even four in 10 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voters expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win the nomination. While support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spread widely among demographic groups, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Pama </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said `` it looks to me from our numbers that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support is softer'' than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s or Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s The CBS-Times poll found that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters were split evenly between those who backed him strongly and those who liked him `` with reservations,'' while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong supporters far outnumbered his weak ones. In another measure, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said four in 10 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters wished other candidates were in the race. Nonetheless, more than six in 10 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrats said he would be the strongest nominee of the current candidates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also scored well in the goodwill category. The CBS-Times poll said 74 percent of Democrats expressed a favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with 22 percent unfavorable. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was rated favorably by 55 percent and unfavorably by 40 percent. `` It is n't that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't liked,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovic </PERSON>, a CBS pollster. `` It's just that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is liked better.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> had the greatest unfavorable rating, more than five in 10, and a favorable rating of about four in 10. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was viewed favorably by better than five in 10 but unfavorably by about four in 10. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and the CBS-Times polls found no evidence of a movement by Republicans to cross over into the Democratic primary and vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the Democrat most likely to lose to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The CBS-Times poll found that of the 14 percent of Democratic voters who said they were Republicans, 42 percent voted for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 28 percent for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and 20 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The exit polls all had a margin of sampling error of about 3 points.

 The 328 passengers on a stranded <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train were treated to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospitality and a barbecue Tuesday after a freight-train derailment kept them in this tiny town for more than 10 hours. The Sunset Limited, which runs from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was stopped at <LOCATION> Sanderson </LOCATION> about 10:30 a.m. CDT Tuesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train derailed ahead of it, said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We could have detoured, but we found it would take a minimum of 13 to 14 hours,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said. So <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> contacted officials in the town of 1,200 people to arrange accommodations for the 328 passengers and 18 crew _ including an impromptu mass-buffet barbecue for dinner. `` We started working on it about 11:30 a.m. _ just as soon as they called,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandifer </PERSON>, who operates Kountry Kitchen with his wife, <PERSON> Jeanie </PERSON>. `` Everybody was real pleased since <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> was paying for it. Everyone I talked to was in a real good mood,'' he said. By 7 p.m., the last of the barbecue brisket, sausage, hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans and potato salad had been eaten, he said. `` We just barely made it,'' he said. `` We did up about 125 pounds of potato salad. They've cleaned us out,'' he said, referring to the passengers who reboarded the train after a 10-hour wait. Meantime, the local historical society offered passengers brief tours of town, children were taken to a park to play and the movie `` La Bamba'' was available in the train's theater. <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, about 120 miles west of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> and about 180 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION>, has about 1,200 residents.

 <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, suspended publication indefinitely Tuesday saying the Sandinista government had not provided newsprint. A front-page story said `` with this edition we exhaust our supply of paper, so we will not be able to circulate as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, the only supplier, does n't sell us paper.'' Anti-Sandinista rebels have charged that the government, by not providing newsprint, violated a recent promise to allow a free press. Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> article rejected government suggestions that <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> ran out of newsprint because of mismanagement of its limited supply, saying publishers had reduced the daily's size from 12 to 8 pages and taken other steps to conserve. Deputy publisher <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said earlier Tuesday: `` We have no paper to come out tomorrow, or on the following days, because the government claims there is no newsprint in the country, but we know there is.'' In a telephone interview, she noted the country's two other daily newspapers, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> publication Barricada and pro-government <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON>, `` have been coming out normally with eight full pages.'' Barricada and <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> are morning papers and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> is an afternoon daily. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it could not solve <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>'s problem because a shipment of newsprint scheduled to arrive in March had not reached <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It said the government is not expecting another shipment until April 17. `` Once this shipment is received the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> will proceed to distribute paper proportionally, according to the established mechanisms,'' the statement said. It added that the government had advised the three newspapers to take precautions against using up their stockpiles of newsprint. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> last published on April 29, then announced it would take its traditional Holy Week break. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> does not manufacture newsprint, and the leftist government controls imports and distribution. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was shut down from June 1986 until last Oct. 1, reopening as part of the government's efforts to comply with a regional Central American peace plan. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, a rebel leader, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> should supply <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> with newsprint under a cease-fire agreement reached last month by the rebels and government. He is a brother of <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and was a co-publisher of La Prensa until going into exile to join the rebels, known as Contras. `` The government originally informed us that an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> could supply us with 70 rolls, enough for one week, but at the last moment they told us the newsprint was n't there anymore,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said `` We have taken steps to find out if they can provide us with paper and we will know tomorrow if we will be coming out, after midday.'' She said the government told <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> it was expecting some newsprint to arrive on a Soviet freighter April 17. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> provide the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> with military equipment, food and other supplies. A letter from Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said, `` It is clear that in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> there exists total and unrestricted freedom of expression for any political group of sector of the population. `` The problem of the lack of paper that is an editorial business is not the responsibility of the government.''

 Americans are enjoying a rare combination of fairly robust growth and slowly rising prices, and a recent uptick in interest rates is no cause for alarm, economists said Tuesday. Interest rates rise when lenders become fearful of inflation, but so far inflation remains under control despite surprisingly strong economic growth. Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of 4 percent to 4.5 percent, roughly as they have for three years. Interest rates fell after the Oct. 19 stock market panic because investors felt the crash might trigger a recession and wipe out inflation.

<HEAD>Undercover Agents to Check on Courtesy in Singapore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government plans to hire undercover courtesy agents to root out rudeness among civil servants. The latest twist in a 10-year campaign to make Singaporeans mind their manners will see private investigators snooping at counters in government buildings where the public is served. Seven research and public relations agencies have bid for a contract to measure courtesy in the civil service, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON>, deputy director of the Psychological Defense Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and Information. A private company is sought for the job to `` ensure objectivity in the exercise,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The courtesy `` audit'' is not a witch hunt to pinpoint individuals, he said. Its purpose is to investigate causes of rudeness and see what can be done to correct them. `` Systems which do n't allow people to be flexible can affect their behavior or cause others to think they are rude.'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said. The first part of the survey will attempt to rank government ministries and statutory bodies in terms of their impact on peoples's lives. `` Civil servants work under constraints,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said. `` Customers may demand that they bypass the system and when they do n't, it comes across as rudeness.'' The check on government workers who deal with the public is in addition to the annual nationwide courtesy drive. Banners and signs, a `` courtesy hotline,'' television announcements and lapel badges appear each July to drive the message home. `` Courtesy: It Makes Life Better,'' is the slogan for 1988. The courtesy campaign is only one of a long series of official efforts to raise civic consciousness in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Unlike most of the others, such as the anti-littering and do n't jaywalk drives, the discourteous are not threatened with fines. Public concern about rudeness started in 1978 when the <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> urged those who dealt with visitors to be polite so they would spend more. `` Courtesy Is Our Way Of Life,'' was the original slogan. `` Make Courtesy Our Way Of Life'' was adopted the following year, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> got involved in national etiquette. `` To be courteous to free-spending tourists and to be rude to fellow Singaporeans is to demean ourselves,'' he said. `` Then we become a despicable people, moved only by the thought of profit.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> set 1990 as the deadline to `` file down the ragged corners of our social behavior which can grate on each other.'' The year 1990 was chosen because by then more than 75 percent of the city-state's 2.6 million people will be living in government-built apartments. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said neighbors would likely be lifelong ones and everone would have a stake in smooth relations. Courtesy campaigners confirm that much remains to be done to polish what is called `` social responsibility'' for public housing, parks and toilets. Many apartment blocks have become high-rise slums with elevators reeking of urine and corridors filled with trash. The elevator problem is so bad that the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> installed a sophisticated monitoring system in three buildings. Sensors activated by the high salt content in urine stop the elevator, activate a video camera in the ceiling and alert the janitor. Officials said five male culprits, aged 7 to 79, have been caught so far this year. `` Singaporeans may not be the most discourteous people on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> but they are certainly nowhere near the top 10 when it comes to courtesy,'' said then-Second Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Sinnathamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajaratnam </PERSON> when he inaugurated the 1983 campaign.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, political foe of President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, is still queen of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s political opposition, but she reigns over a party in disarray The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party -LRB- PPP -RRB-, which she inherited from her late father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, has been racked in recent months by political infighting, an ideological shift and a poor showing in local elections. Nevertheless, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> says she is determined to pull her grass-roots movement back together for national elections scheduled for 1990 in which she could face <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> head-on. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> has indicated he will run. Millions turned out in April 1986 when Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, now 34, returned from two years of voluntary exile in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The adoring masses likened her to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> who would ride to office on a wave of `` people power.'' Two years later, however, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s critics say her policies are hard to discern from those of the <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> government. They call her leadership autocratic, her lifestyle patrician, and claim her overtures toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> run counter to the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION>'s traditions <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> overthrew her father in a 1977 military coup. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> later was convicted of complicity in the killing of a political opponent and he was hanged in 1979. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, an army general and chief of the army staff, ruled by martial law until the end of 1985, when a civilian government was voted into office in an election that barred political parties. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> retained the presidency. Since then, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and his prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, have restored a number of fundamental civil rights and lifted most censorship of the press. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> attributed the recent criticism of her to the government. `` In the first years of overmilitary rule, the name of the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> family was not allowed to appear in the press,'' she said. `` The new target, since the last two years, is to flood newspapers with stories on <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> and flood them with distorted stories attacking my capabilities, attacking my leadership.'' But many of her critics are current and former <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is a complete mistress unto herself, seldom considering it necessary to consult the -LRB- party's -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on major issues,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Ayaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, a Pakistani magazine. The critics say the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION> is still a party of the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> family, built around the charisma of <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and perpetuated by what followers view as his martyrdom. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> takes more seriously the criticism of her changing policies, especially her pro-Americanism and her shift away from her father's socialist ideals. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is in a period of transition,'' she said. `` We do n't have a direct military rule; we have an indirect military rule, or we have the iron fist in the velvet glove In this new situation the party and the party workers must also make the mental transition and the necessary adjustments that come from conforming to the new circumstances.'' She said her warming toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which she once accused of helping cause her father's downfall, is a pragmatic recognition of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s role in the region. `` It is a country that gives tremendous economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. One can not ignore that reality.'' Along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s government, her party supports the Moslem resistance against the Soviet-backed government in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As for her economic policies, which are described as moderate, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she has deviated no more from the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION>'s founding principles than her father did. `` This is nothing new. They -LRB- the left wing -RRB- would like to transform the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION>, which is a populist, social-democratic party in the Moslem context, into a Marxist party,'' she said. `` We may not agree, but -LRB- we -RRB- respect them for having their views and expect them to respect our views.'' Upon her triumphal return to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> called for elections within months but the demand was not met. She then called for mass protests on July 5 of that year, the anniversary of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s coup, and the turnout was far less than expected. The following month, she and 400 opposition leaders were arrested for defying a government ban on rallies. She was released, but her problems were compounded this past November when her party won only 20 percent of some 75,000 seats at stake in local elections. Although candidates officially were banned from declaring their party affiliations in the election, those of <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> campaigned openly. The deafeat led to a series of firings and resignations within the PPP. In December, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was back in the limelight with her much-publicized marriage, arranged in the Islamic tradition, to a <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> businessman. This year she has been making a series of barnstorming trips into the Pakistani hinterlands. She also has managed to rally her party around a new cause: the fate of about 400 Pakistanis still in prison for violations of martial law in 1977-85. Although Prime Minister <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> has promised to review some of the cases, a constitutional amendment at the time of the restoration of civilian rule blocks the judicial review of decisions made during martial law.

<TEXT>
 Be thankful for the low spots and the dull narration in `` Family Reunion _ A Gospel Music Celebration.'' Without the low points, the voltage from this musical blowout might leave viewers writhing on the floor. Television sets might explode and fires break out across the land. `` Family Reunion,'' appearing Saturday on the <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, offers two hours of hits from some of the biggest names in gospel music, including the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrae </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bebe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cece </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, and The Mighty Clouds of Joy. What's wrong with the packaging can be summed up in two words: <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The ageless record-spinner, planted beside a fireplace, has little to say about the history or the meaning of gospel music. His role seems to be to assure the uninitiated that it's OK to listen, because the Beatles did, too. He might have said more about the history of gospel, because a lot is implied by the songs and the singers. `` Precious Lord,'' sung here by <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, was written in 1931 by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, the man who invented gospel. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was a boy soprano in <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>'s choir at the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In the 1960s, as the `` crown prince of gospel,'' <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> worked with such young people as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> hits one of the program's high points with a bluesy rendition of Professor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s `` I'm Too Close to Heaven -LRB- and I Ca n't Turn Around -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, whose growling voice and dabbing handkerchief recall <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, comes up next and steals the show with `` Peace, Be Still.'' The song was a huge hit in gospel terms, selling 800,000 albums in the 1960s. It's a dramatic piece in which <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> sweats, shouts, sings and preaches, turning down the volume with a peremptory `` shhh!'' and then building to another plateau. `` Family Reunion'' covers some of the same territory covered last year with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the Cinemax special, `` Everybody Say Yeah!'' <PERSON> Andrae </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singers </ORGANIZATION> and the Mighty Clouds of Joy appeared on both shows. There's even the same quotation from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> _ `` there is no music like that music'' _ which, if you think about it, applies to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Welk </PERSON> and a lot of other styles, too. But you get the point. High follows high, sometiomes in unexpected places. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' familiar hit, `` Oh Happy Day,'' is given some needed rough edges by the fiery, strutting solo work of <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tramaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> _ wife of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> _ lights up the place with `` Changed.'' Finally, the <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> who wrecks the house is n't <PERSON> Andrae </PERSON>, but his sister, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>. This regal lady, a hard-working choir director through much of the show, takes the solo part as she whips a quartet and chorus through a rousing performance of `` He's Worthy.'' Amid all the stars, the show's last high point is hit by an unidentified young woman who steps out of the choir in `` He's Worthy,'' and she's ready Not only has she picked up a couple of microphone moves from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligon </PERSON> of the Mighty Clouds, but she has a huge voice that lifts the roof. It bodes well for the future of gospel.

 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Blew </PERSON> are having fun these days growing vegetables on their 160-acre farm, making some money and raising three children in wide open spaces only 45 minutes from the smokestacks of industrial <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Things were n't always so good. For five years, they struggled, saddled with a six-figure mortgage and a floating interest rate that reached 16 percent. Theirs was a Catch-22 situation. To make more money to pay the mortgage, the Blews rented 1,000 more acres and grew wholesale grain. They considered it drudgery, and, worse, the new loans only added to their debt. Then, about two years ago, they found a way to pay off their mortgage, keep their <LOCATION> Hunterdon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farm for their children and make money growing what they wanted: They sold development rights to their land to the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as part of a farm land preservation program. More and more state and local governments are giving top priority _ and tens of millions of dollars _ to farm land preservation programs, efforts to save rapidly vanishing open space from developers. The trend is spreading from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where it started, to the South and West. The government assesses the land's value for farming and compares that to its higher worth for housing or commercial use, such as a mall. The farmer is offered the difference in dollars in return for an agreement that the land can never be sold for development. The farmer keeps the property and can still sell it, but its deed will be restricted to farming or open space use. The Blews received almost $ 900 an acre or $ 143,500 from the state and county, which split the cost. That same day, Dec. 19, 1985, they turned the check over to the bank, paying off their mortgage, on which they had been making payments of close to $ 10,000 every six months, and an outstanding business loan. `` We had $ 10 -LRB- left -RRB- to go to lunch,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> said. They celebrated at a <LOCATION> Ponderosa </LOCATION> restaurant with steaks and chocolate milk. `` It came to $ 10.12,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, smiling. The Blews can afford to smile now. The pressure is off. `` It relieved the pressure of that exploding interest rate,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> said. `` You enjoy working when you're making some money, when you're able to pay your bills and have something left over.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s share of the money came from a $ 50 million bond issue voters approved in 1981. Other states with similar farm land and open space preservation programs include <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Local programs exist in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, whose respective seats are <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, around <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties. In <LOCATION> Collin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, officials are trying to raise funds for land preservation. Over the last decade, almost 100,000 acres of working farm land have been saved, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggle </PERSON>, director of field operations for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a non-profit organization that works to conserve agriculture. The success of preservation programs, however, does n't mean development is being slowed. <PERSON> Riggle </PERSON> estimated that since World War II, some 70 million to 100 million acres of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural land has been converted to commercial or residential use, or has been used for highway or other public works projects. That leaves no more than 1.2 billion acres of privately owned open land nationwide, of which 575 million are being farmed or have a high potential for farming, while the rest remains unused for crops because of its lesser quality. Roughly 3 million acres of farm land are being lost every year, he said. `` Six out of 10 of the most productive agricultural counties are either already classified in metropolitan areas or adjacent to them,'' he said. `` That's where the action is taking place. There is a general degrading of the quality of our land in this country.'' Development pressure in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> remains strong even though the state has already spent $ 45 million to buy up rights and preserve nearly 20,000 acres. The Legislature last December approved an additional $ 35 million for the program. Why? `` You're preserving the economic fabric of the rural area. It has an additional benefit. It's a working landscape,'' replied <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> commissioner of food and agriculture. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Allbee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s commissioner of agriculture, agreed. `` We sell <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to tourists for the pristine open space, for the small villages,'' <PERSON> Allbee </PERSON> said. `` I think there's a broader concern. If we lose our agriculture, we're going to lose what people identify as <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.'' Even in big cities, such as <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, voters are overwhelmingly approving bond issues to buy up the rights. There are many reasons. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which is just beginning its program after voters approved a $ 100 million bond issue in November, agriculture is the No. 1 industry. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> has 56,500 farms that produce crops worth $ 3.2 billion a year and generate $ 35 billion in related business. But since 1960, the state has lost 50,000 farms and 3.8 million acres of land that went out of production, most of it believed to be for development. Along with economics, sentiment helped the pro-preservation forces, state Sen. <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenger </PERSON> said. `` Even people that live in the cities can remember their grandfather or their uncle living on a farm,'' he said, `` and they have a certain affinity to that and I think that was in its favor.'' But even more, <PERSON> Wenger </PERSON> said, was the realization that about 20 percent of all the jobs in the state are related to agriculture. `` It's just good business sense to take care of your No. 1 industry,'' he said. `` You would spend $ 100 million to keep a basic industry intact so that that industry can continue to pay taxes and provide jobs so that we will have funds available to support our social programs, our research programs.'' Other referendums approved last November included a $ 65.2 million bond issue to help preserve open space in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> voters, in their second referendum on the issue in six years, overwhelmingly approved raising the state's share for farm development buyouts to 80 percent, making it easier for counties with limited funds to become partners.

And they're willing to pay for it.'' The trend toward preservation of farm land appears to be gaining priority beyond the Northeast. `` The idea has begun to catch on,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Riggle </PERSON>. Californians will vote June 7 on a referendum for $ 776 million to preserve open space, including farm land, greenbelts and parks. The bond issue is the first in 74 years to be placed on the ballot by voter petition rather than by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, underscoring the growing enthusiasm. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a state law requires every county to develop within the year a program to limit incursion into rural areas. More than 90 percent of all open land outside urban areas in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is farm land. `` People are beginning to recognize the finite resource that we have,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION>. `` Good farm land is worth protecting. In many communities it is the buffer zone between the next city, the open space people like to drive to.'' <PERSON> Riggle </PERSON> said the preservation programs are concentrated in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> because it is the oldest settled region and the states are small, and often mountainous, limiting the amount of arable land. `` The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> states have had to confront the issue of urban growth and development versus open land resources sooner than the rest of the country,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> is one of the Northeast's concerned farmers. He sold the development rights to 70 acres of his farm land in <LOCATION> Howell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Freehold </LOCATION>, to the state for about a half million dollars last September. Developers had offered him more than a million. `` I would only have to take that money and go out and buy another one. Farming is n't an occupation. It's a way of life,'' he said. `` It's not necessarily something you get into with the idea of getting rich. It's something you get into because it's a matter of the heart.''

 <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s argument for preserving farm land is right outside his picture window, which frames a view of sheep grazing on alfalfa hay under ash and hemlock trees. `` I ca n't think of any explanation better than asking you to look out that window,'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> told a visitor to his sheep farm 40 minutes from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` If you could preserve something like that, would n't you do so?'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> has been a leader in saving farm land _ and yet he illustrates a dilemma posed by new programs compensating farmers who agree to deed restrictions that keep their lands forever undeveloped. Last October, he sold to the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the development rights to a second farm he owns, an 85-acre site in nearby <LOCATION> Neshanic </LOCATION> on which he grows alfalfa to feed his sheep. But he does n't plan to sell the state the development rights to the 86-acre sheep farm in <LOCATION> Whitehouse </LOCATION>. When he dies, he said, his five children can decide. `` My heirs do n't think highly of the program'' he said. `` They'd rather see the land unencumbered so they can do with it whatever they like after I die ... They've never said that. I should only say that my heirs have different circumstances. One of my heirs has two children. He's out ... earning a living. And he says, ` Hey, what's going on? Why give it to the state? You can sell it differently.''' Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s farm land preservation program, the farmer is paid the difference between the assessed value of the land for farm production and its worth for development into housing or commercial use. The state and counties share the cost. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> stumbled into farming as a second career at age 50. He had owned a paper bag manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> but lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and became fed up with the traffic jams on his commute. One day while driving with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, he made a wrong turn and ended up in the farm land of <LOCATION> Hunterdon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I said, ` Why do n't we find a place right here?' She went out and shopped and then found this place. This had been a dairy farm before we took over. It was empty of equipment and empty of animals. I was wondering what we were going to do to keep the grass down. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> said, ` Sheep. I can handle sheep. They're small enough for me.''' They moved to the <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON> farm in 1970. Baron sold his paper business in 1979 and became a full-time farmer, now with a herd of 1,000. `` I love it,'' he said. `` I tell you, the best years of my life.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s long-running dispute over a constitutional amendment created to protect family farmers has just two points of agreement: It's the toughest corporate farm restriction in the nation, and the fight's far from over. Each side claims to be working in the best interest of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and its farmers. The question, according to a leading supporter, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON>, is whether `` <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s ag future will develop on its family farm base, whether farms in the future will be owned and operated by people who live on them and are part of the community that those farms are the economic base of.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCamp </PERSON>, a lobbyist and former state senator, is an outspoken opponent. `` It's a handicap to normal business and commerce as conducted in the ... the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` A corporation is a normal tool for doing business, just like a combine is a normal tool for processing and harvesting corn.'' The battle over what became Initiative 300 began in the early 1970s, as irrigation development and corporate interest in agriculture burgeoned. The dispute peaked when corporate farming foes, frustrated by years of legislative inaction, gathered enough signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the 1982 general election ballot. The amendment ran about 1,100 words, but its basic provisions were: _ Non-family farm corporations, with a few exceptions, can not own agricultural land or engage in farming and can not own or feed livestock, except for livestock purchased for slaughter and a few other kinds. _ The majority of voting stock in family farm and ranch corporations must be held by family members, at least one of whom must live on the farm or be actively engaged in the daily labor and management. _ Individuals and groups can seek enforcement if the secretary of state or attorney general fails to enforce the amendment. An emotional campaign preceded the vote. Opponents said the proposal would paralyze economic growth and stifle competition; supporters argued that corporate farming threatened rural economic and social foundations. Voters approved the amendment, 290,377 to 224,555, but the issue remained unsettled. Legislators have tried unsuccessfully to pass laws clarifying the amendment and to get voters to abolish it. A court challenge ended when the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled the amendment constitutional. However, opponents say the court test was decided on too narrow a question of law and talk of staging another petition drive to return the issue to the ballot. Strange, senior associate for the Center for Rural Affairs in <LOCATION> Walthill </LOCATION>, contends the amendment has done exactly what it was designed to do _ protect family farmers from unfair corporate competition. It is the nation's `` only truly effective'' family farm legislation because it is in the state constitution and restricts corporate farming activities as well as land ownership, he said. Opponents argue that Initiative 300 restricts business, scares many companies away from investing in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, prevents farmers from selling land to whomever they choose and affords protections that are unfair, unnecessary and unrealistic. `` The only way that family farms will be saved is economically,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Baack </PERSON>, a vocal foe who farms about 2,000 acres and raises wheat and sunflowers. `` We need prices for our products. Those are the kind of things that will save family farms. It's not going to be words in our constitution.'' Another state senator, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, said Initiative 300 has n't been on the books long enough to assess whether it is restricting business or helping farmers. `` The people are the ones who put it there and they did it because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> chose not to act,'' said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who favors the measure. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case, filed earlier this year by opponents, is the first federal test of the amendment. A hearing is scheduled April 18. The federal lawsuit, filed by <ORGANIZATION> Sunrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a custom cattle-feeding operation, seeks to stop Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spire </PERSON> from enforcing Initiative 300 on the grounds it violates the commerce, equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S Constitution. Sunrise may be in violation of the amendment's prohibitions on ownership of livestock, Spire said, but the company appears to be exempt under a provision that allows ownership of animals `` purchased for slaughter.'' On that ground, Spire has asked that Sunrise's suit be dismissed. Amendment opponents hailed Spire's action as a kind of concession _ and a victory. <PERSON> DeCamp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baack </PERSON> said it opened up the issue because all cattle ultimately are slaughtered. `` There are very few cattle in my district that live to be retired,'' <PERSON> Baack </PERSON> said. Strange called Spire's action irresponsible, but said `` it does n't affect the foundation of the family farm amendment at all.'' <PERSON> DeCamp </PERSON> agreed the dispute is n't over. If the Sunrise case is dismissed, opponents will challenge the issues of land ownership and engaging in farming, he said. `` This is just the beginning,'' he said. `` I'm sure the next stage wo n't be so easy.''

 More than one farmer having trouble keeping ahead of his bills has called on <ORGANIZATION> Amaranth </ORGANIZATION>, Arrowroot, <LOCATION> Cipolines </LOCATION>, Daikon and <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>. They're not bankruptcy lawyers. They're exotic vegetables, fruits and seeds. These and others, from fava beans to purple potatoes, are being grown by `` gourmet farmers'' to meet an increasing demand for specialty foods. In some cases, they are more profitable than conventional crops. <PERSON> Frieda </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Frieda </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> company that markets unusual fruits and vegetables to stores nationwide, said her sales had increased by nearly 20 percent a year for the last four years to $ 15 million currently. `` There has been an explosion in unusual foods,'' she said. `` One reason is the increased interest in health. Markets are allocating more space to fresh produce. Smart retailers are putting in a great deal of variety. They want the consumer to know they have everything they want.'' Some farmers, she said, are getting into specialty crops because they are not making a living on the big conventional crops like wheat, alfalfa and cotton. `` They're looking to find more profitable items to be grown,'' she said. `` They're beginning to learn that bigness does not necessarily mean profitability. Sometimes you make more by growing less.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said people today have higher living standards and want more variety in their food. He said there is a growing demand for ethnic vegetables in most of the larger cities. Exotic foods are being brought to this country by immigrants from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This is not to say that <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wo n't be corny in August anymore.

So, some definitions: <ORGANIZATION> Amaranth </ORGANIZATION> is a seed with a mild nutty flavor that can be ground into flour, popped like popcorn or sprinkled on cereals and ice cream. Arrowroot is a Chinese potato. Cipolines are baby round onions. Daikon is a giant white oriental radish. A manzano is a small banana. Fava beans come in large pods and are tastier than lima beans. And purple potatoes? <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> them, and they just get purpler.

<HEAD>Japanese Car Makers Help Boost U.S. Motor Vehicle Exports To Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aided by the stronger yen, sales of U.S.-built motor vehicles in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are expected to triple this year, but still will hold only a marginal share of the world's second-largest auto market. Sales of U.S.-built cars could reach 12,000 this year, out of a 6 million-vehicle market that includes minitrucks and minicars. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers should not be overjoyed at such growth, because much of it will come from Japanese automakers who export their U.S.-built cars to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Kunihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said the impetus for the surge would not come from the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ but from imports of the Honda Accord designed by the wholly-owned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and assembled at its plant in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The expected surge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motor vehicle sales underscores the efforts made by the governments of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since September 1985 to reduce trade imbalances by driving down the value of the dollar and improving the export competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industry. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> also said foreign car makers should be more encouraged to export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of the government's recent move to remove tariffs on imported cars and relax elaborate import inspection procedures. But Japanese government and industry officials criticize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Big Three automakers for failing to capitalize on the dollar's decline, which should make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autos more competitive against local models Recent Japanese import statistics indicate only the West Germans have been able to seize on a growing Japanese consumer preference toward luxury cars fueled by the stronger buying power stemming from the rising yen. Of the 97,750 foreign motor vehicles sold here last year, only 4,006 or 4.1 percent were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> made. West German makers accounted for sales of 74,289 units, or 76 percent. Analysts say sales of U.S.-made motor vehicles in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have been less than impressive since peaking at 16,739 vehicles in 1979. This week, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> will become the first Japanese automaker to import its U.S.-made cars when 540 Accords are unloaded from a U.S.-flagged ship at <LOCATION> Narashino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, has announced that this summar it will begin sales of the 2.2 liter-engined Ford Probe built at <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s new plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosoya </PERSON>, says his company is hoping to handle 3,000 to 4,000 Probes annually in the future after selling 800 units this year. Many observers see the Big Three's problems as stemming from a lack of commitment to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, not necessarily from current Japanese business conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Koichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshizawa </PERSON> said that, even accounting for export costs, it should cost as much to build cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as it does in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as long as the dollar remains near current levels. <PERSON> Takamori </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, says <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is suffering from an image problem, as evidenced by deep-rooted Japanese consumer distrust toward the Big Three's overall product quality as well as by commonly held views about poor after-sales servicing, bad fuel economy and high sticker prices. Other factors include the unsubstantiated association between their cars and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s underworld, the Yakuza gangsters. The Yakuzas are said to prefer driving large, luxurious U.S.-made cars. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> reports that parking lots in western Japanese cities, where certain powerful Yakuza clans are based, refuse to admit foreign cars, including Volkswagens, claiming they are a cause of trouble. To increase its market share in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an official at a leading Japanese automaker argues, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> should adopt a long-term commitment that can withstand short-term losses. `` If they want a bigger slice of the market, they'd have to, first, create Japanese sales subsidiaries and set up decent distribution channels and reduce their reliance on small-scale importers, and, second, market right-hand drive cars,'' he said. Analysts see recent moves by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to team up with <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, respectively, as a step in the right direction. One of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s two dealer networks early this year added the Ford Taurus to its product lineup and expects to sell 1,000 cars this year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s joint operations with <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, which is 5 percent controlled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, will market two <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> subcompacts starting in April or May. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> officials hope to sell 500 cars the first year, and to boost sales to 3,000 units annually in three years.

<TEXT>
 F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, faced with the prospect of becoming <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s latest takeover target, is shoring up its defenses. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that a partnership controlled by <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> _ who is fresh from an unsuccessful raid against <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> _ had disclosed it planned to acquire $ 15 million or more of the retailer's stock. The nation's 13th largest retailer, which built its reputation running a national chain of five-and-dime stores before expanding into specialty retailing, said its board approved a `` poison pill'' takeover defense after <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s disclosure. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that its board adopted the defense `` to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics.'' Wall Street indicated it expected the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> to make a bid soon for <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>. The retailer's stock shot up $ 8.87 -LCB- to $ 54.12 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. Based on Monday's closing stock price and the company's roughly 65.7 million common shares outstanding, <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> had a market value of about $ 3.6 billion. Less than a month ago, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> terminated a $ 1.03 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Boston-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop after its target agreed to a leveraged buyout by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md.-based <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> owns and operates <ORGANIZATION> Trak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The Hafts repeatedly have said they were serious about buying and operating a retailer, but doubts linger about their actual intentions. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover moves against such retailers as <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in recent years has given <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON>, reputations as corporate raiders. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has made millions of dollars from its takeover forays by acquiring stock and later either selling it back to the target company or to another suitor. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> was not available when a reporter called for comment Monday. A source close to <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> confirmed the partnership had disclosed in a March 18 filing with the federal government of its intentions to acquire a <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> stake. The source declined to say whether a takeover bid was in the offing. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, declined to comment when asked what steps the company might take if and when the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> make a takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill would make a hostile takeover more expensive by allowing the company's shareholders to buy its stock at a steep discount. It becomes effective when an investor acquires 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, on the commencement of a tender offer for 30 percent or more of the retailer's shares, or when a hostile bidder acquires at least 15 percent of the company's stock. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that if faced by a hostile buyout attempt <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> might consider going private under a leveraged buyout. Other options open to the retailer include acquiring another company itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s low stock price and the company's low-rental properties and successful specialty store formats make it an attractive target <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>, founded 109 years ago by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolworth </PERSON> as a five-and-dime store, has grown to an empire of more than 6,300 general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide. In recent years, the company has shifted its focus from its well-known <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> stores to its specialty operations, which include <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> shoe stores and Foot Locker and <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Foot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Locker </LOCATION> athletic footwear stores. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 251 million on sales of $ 7.14 billion.

But a senior official said the rise in food imports will be kept slow, despite increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to open up its agricultural market. Negotiations between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials on access to local markets broke down last week after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> refused to terminate stringent import quotas for beef and citrus fruits. An earlier four-year agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food imports expired March 30. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has maintained it only will increase its quota figures, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has demanded total liberalization. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they will petition the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international forum that oversees trade rules agreed upon by member nations, this week to convene a panel and have the quota system deemed illegal under international trading rules. <PERSON> Soshichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON>, director of the Research Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could not drop all food import quotas without causing widespread disruption. But he said the government expects to decrease its present beef self-sufficiency rate of 70 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 1995. Because domestic beef supplies are growing slowly, most of the increasing demand for beef must be accounted for by imports, <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> said. `` We will try to open our markets and improve access, but at the same time try to strengthen the structure and constitution of the competitiveness of the Japanese agricultural industry,'' <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing on the agricultural white paper, or policy document. While less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s population is engaged in farming, farmers provide a strong backbone for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Attempts to open up any section of the agricultural market traditionally have met with strong resistance. The white paper said the government's first major task in coming years will be to establish a self-supporting, highly productive agricultural industry. `` We are not saying that there should be self-sufficiency in food at any or all costs,'' <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> said, but `` the first priority or task is to make sure that there is a stable supply of food.'' The director said government will combine domestic production with `` an appropriate level of imports from overseas so that ... food supply will be secured on a stable basis.'' <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> also said the government will reduce its price supports for some products, such as eggs, because of the intense price war that has sprung up between domestic and foreign foods because of the sharp appreciation of the yen against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar since September 1985. But he added the yen's upward swing would have slow impact on products from land-based farming, such as rice. `` Therefore some price gap -LRB- between domestic and imported foods -RRB- would have to remain and we must gain the understanding and convince the public that the gap is inevitable,'' <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> said. `` And to the extent that some gaps remain, some protective measures will have to be kept in place for such commodities as rice and beef.'' <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> declined to comment on how <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would react if <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> ruled against the import quotas that are under fire from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The trade body ordered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in February to lift import curbs on 10 types of farm products to get into line with international rules, following a 1987 probe sparked by an American complaint. While <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accepted the ruling on eight of the products, it refused to lift curbs on starch and dairy products and to date has not stated any clear measures on eliminating the import barriers on the eight products, which include tomato ketchup, glucose and caramel. But <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was obligated to implement the findings of the report and will `` have to work with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to map out the specifics and substance of what should be done.''

<HEAD>Mexico Cheapest, Norway Most Expensive for US Employers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was the cheapest country last year and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> the most expensive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers who measure labor costs in dollars, according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In dollar terms, costs in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were $ 1.37 an hour in 1987, compared with $ 1.49 in 1986 and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average of $ 13.46. Wages more than doubled when measured in Mexican pesos, but the peso's foreign exchange value fell so quickly that labor costs in dollars actually declined <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s average hourly compensation totaled 118.52 kroner, or about $ 17.58. The figures released Monday take into account of the drop in the value of the dollar, changes in local pay rates, the cost of social insurance and other benefits. The calculations do not include the relative efficiency of workers in different countries. Wages and other benefits for workers rose in terms of Brazilian cruzados, but in dollar terms there was a decline to $ 1.49 from $ 1.60 an hour because of the low value of the cruzado against the dollar. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are the Third World's two biggest debtors, which tends to depress the foreign exchange value of their currencies. They were the only two nations where dollar-denominated labor costs dropped last year. Low wage rates in developing countries are considered a key competitive advantage for those nations in exporting goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Labor in the newly-industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> remained less than a fifth as costly as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Costs in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s `` four tigers'' _ <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> _ rose by only 1 to 4 percentage points relative to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of 22 countries, eight had costs higher than the $ 13.46 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hourly average. They were, in addition to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, 25.46 Swiss francs, or $ 17.06; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 30.26 marks, or $ 16.83; <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, 96.07 krona, or $ 15.14; <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 30.61 guilders, or $ 15.11; <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 563.37 Belgian francs, or $ 15.08 and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 99.20 kroner, or $ l4 .49 All 23 countries for which the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had statistics, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, showed higher labor costs in terms of their own currency. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relative cost level in 1987 _ of 84 percent _ greatly exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in 1986,'' said the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The increase in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s labor costs was due largely to the rise of the yen against the dollar. That also was the reason for most of the rise in European costs, although they also were affected by declines in working hours by <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the report stated.

<HEAD>University Setting Up International Computer Bank Of Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American companies soon will have access to a new computer database offering information about millions of products made by their foreign competitors, according to the head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> project. `` It is the only one of its kind in the country,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulds </PERSON>, assistant professor of international marketing, said Monday. `` It's kind of surprising given the emphasis on product quality now. The International Product Quality Database uses various consumer reports to come up with product quality rankings from on an item and on up to 48 specific product features, said <PERSON> Faulds </PERSON>. It also has marketing information on the products, he said. `` We're still compiling -LRB- entries -RRB- and trying to develop off-campus computer capability ... so <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies can tap into this by phone,'' <PERSON> Faulds </PERSON> said. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>, dean of the university's College of Business where the database was created, said the computer bank would give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers an edge in knowing the strengths and weaknesses of their international competition, thereby helping them improve their own positions in the marketplace. So far, the database has nearly a million brand names and rankings on products sold in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Faulds </PERSON> said the database should be available to American companies in less than two years, but the university had not decided whether to let foreign businesses have access. `` We're kind of debating that right now,'' he said. `` There is a political side.'' <PERSON> Faulds </PERSON> said he has spent five years collecting the product quality rankings and comments by such groups as automobile testers, government bureaus, engineering associations, independent and consumer product testing groups.

<HEAD>Chrysler Workers Gathering to Set Demands for Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers, anxious to receive the same benefits that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers received in new contracts last fall, are preparing contract demands for talks beginning April 18. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union's 140-member national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council were to begin arriving in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, today for a meeting with national <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders and elected union bargainers. By Friday, the council planned to have discussed and approved demands that will guide how the industry pattern contract, established at the two larger companies, can be installed at the smallest Big Three automaker. The Chrysler contract, covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers, expires Sept. 14. Talks are scheduled to begin April 18, instead of mid-July as usual. The two sides agreed to early talks to stem damage inflicted by friction over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s closing of an assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and the abortive sale of its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was stunned by the speed and severity of the union's opposition to the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale Angry workers at locals across the nation began preparing `` strike packages'' _ lists of grievances over locally strikeable issues _ and stopped cooperating in crucial management-union programs aimed at improving quality and production efficiency. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, who will lead negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, told workers at the time that he would give local unions with grievances permission to strike immediately. A few strikes at key assembly and parts plants could have crippled <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> as quickly as a national strike. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> quickly backed down from the proposed sale in early March and agreed to early contract talks, a request it had refused last fall after the union wrapped up contracts at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. Negotiators on both sides are limited to working within the pattern contract, which forbids layoffs except during declining sales of a particular product and requires automakers to continue paying workers whose jobs are lost to productivity improvements, new technology or transfer of work to outside suppliers. The pattern contract also includes joint six-month, plant-by-plant studies that will examine ways to strengthen operations and keep work inside each company. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> hopes the studies will make it harder for automakers to pit plant against plant in competition for a shrinking number of jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> is expected to seek a two-year contract instead of the usual three-year pact so that its contracts with all Big Three makers will expire together in 1990. The union also will seek more representation on the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> has a board seat, but the union believes holding more seats will give it more control over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> decisions. Bargainers will work against an artificial target deadline instead of a strike deadline, so <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> faces no risk of a companywide strike if talks fail. Industry analysts expect a quick settlement. But a failure at the table would sour relations and make talks more difficult when the two sides were forced to resume bargaining in the summer.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several unidentified suitors have made takeover proposals for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the filmmaker that was sold and bought back by financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>. The company's announcement Monday sent <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> stock up $ 3 for the day to close at $ 12 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The offers will be studied by a special committee of directors which was to be created at a scheduled board meeting today. `` We have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> declined to identify the suitors but analysts suggested <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns 79 percent of the company's 50.1 million shares, may be seeking to take <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> private. Other possible suitors, they said, are investors <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, whose separate bids for other companies are stalled and considered unlikely to succeed. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had no comment, a spokesman said, and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> was traveling and unavailable for comment. The company said it announced the proposals when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern over an unusual increase in trading of the company's stock. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> had been majority owner of the old <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> studios </ORGANIZATION>, then sold them in 1986 to media entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> for $ 1.5 billion plus assumption of some of its debt. As part of that deal, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> immediately bought back the <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> segment. Later, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> sold off all of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> unit, except its film library, which he retained for use on his Atlanta-based superstation <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> purchased the studio and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought some other assets. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> paid a total of $ 730 million to buy back the two segments. The new <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> has had spotty success. Its recent film `` Moonstruck'' is a box-office hit and has been nominated for six Academy Awards. Its new film, `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, ranked third in box-office gross for its debut weekend. Ticket sales still were being tallied. Last year, the company scored a hit with the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> thriller `` The Living Daylights.'' But <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> also has had box-office flops, including its critically acclaimed but poorly attended `` Masquerade,'' as well as `` Fatal Beauty,'' `` Real Men,'' and `` Dead of Winter.'' For its first quarter ended Nov. 30, earnings dropped 19 percent to $ 2.1 million from $ 2.6 million, although revenue rose 39 percent to $ 182 million from $ 131 million. The company cited continuing high start-up costs as well as an unspecified writedown on the film `` Real Men.'' For its first fiscal year ended Aug. 31, the company lost $ 88.1 million on revenue of $ 427.6 million. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has been seeking to get back into the entertainment business since selling 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> three years ago, is bidding $ 770.1 million for <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But that bid has been given short shrift by <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>, which is discussing a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, whose holdings range from cement production to the company that created `` The Dating Game,'' is offering $ 1.58 billion for <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns newspapers and radio But his overtures have been spurned by the company's founding family, which holds voting control.

<HEAD>Import Automakers' Study Refutes Big Three Dumping Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto importers have issued a study attempting to refute a Big Three review that found Japanese automakers were dumping compact pickup trucks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The importers' study found Japanese automakers continued earning profits averaging $ 1,000 per vehicle sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> compared with the $ 100 - $ 125 profit on each vehicle they sold in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Japanese companies were earning an average $ 2,000 per vehicle sold here when the yen began appreciating against the dollar in 1985, leaving a cushion that let them raise prices by less than the yen had appreciated while preserving profits, the study indicated. The study was prepared by <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, research firm, for <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of a <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> study released last week. The import association's members include <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> MVMA </ORGANIZATION> study, prepared on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm and found that Japanese makers were charging 10 percent to 48 percent less at the factory for small pickups destined for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market than for the same vehicles destined for their home market. The <ORGANIZATION> MVMA </ORGANIZATION> study also argued that the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers were being injured by the dumping because they were not able to make full use of factories and Japanese undercutting had hurt their profits. The importers' study looked mostly at cars because of the strength of the domestic truck market, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, the analyst who prepared it, said Monday. `` One reason we were n't concerned about doing a dumping calculation on trucks was because the -LRB- domestics makers' -RRB- market performance was so strong in terms of growth in sales and growth in market share,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. In 1987, sales of small pickups by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> grew by about 10 percent, or 135,000 trucks, while Japanese makers' sales fell by about the same in a steady market, he said. Truck buyers are motivated strongly by price, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said, so if the Japanese makers were pricing unfairly low they would have held or gained sales. The study, completed March 14, also indicated: _ About 25 percent of Japanese makers' costs, including advertising, marketing, distribution and freight, are incurred in dollars and are not affected by the currency's weakness against the yen _ Japanese companies have countered some of the pressures of the strong yen by improving productivity and transferring parts production from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to lower-cost countries such as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry charging foreign competitors with dumping, or selling products in this market for less than in their home market or for less than the cost of production, must prove it has been harmed by the practice before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will impose punitive import duties. In the study, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> stated domestic makers held their share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck market in 1987 despite a 1 million-vehicle drop in their sales and a 1.15 million-vehicle overall drop in the market. Much of the decline was borne by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, whose share of the domestic market fell nearly five percentage points in 1987 as its lost sales to domestic competitors rather than to foreign makers, the study found.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose against most major currencies in quiet early trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today when markets reopened after a four-day shutdown in most centers for the long Easter holiday weekend. Gold prices were mixed after the holiday break. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.58 yen to close at 124.43 yen, compared with 123.85 on Monday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 124.52 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound, which hit a six-year high of $ 1.8895 for two straight days last Thursday and Friday, eased to $ 1.888. However, many dealers expected sterling to push ahead later in the week. One <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer said general market sentiment toward the dollar appeared cool, despite the rises in early trading. `` Few people want to give dollars at this level,'' said the dealer. `` They are keeping an eye on the central banks and are holding back. No sudden fall, but the dollar may drift slowly lower.'' Other dollar rates at mid-morning today, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.6585 West German marks, up from 1.6565; 1.3658 Swiss francs, up from 1.3635; 5.6225 French francs, down from 5.6270; 1.8615 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8595; 1,230.20 Italian lire, up from 1,228.75; and 1.2415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2335. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 455.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 454.50.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises From Three-Month Low, Stocks Fall Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, recovering from a three-month low against the Japanese yen, edged upward today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Stock prices remained little changed in lackluster trading. After opening at 124.38 yen, the dollar edged up and ended the day at 124.43 yen, up 0.58 yen from the Monday's close of 123.85 yen. It ranged between 124.30 yen-124 .75 yen On Monday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, opened at 123.70, its lowest opening level since Jan. 5 when it started trading at 123 yen. `` The dollar gained ground following an overnight advance at Wall Street,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Iiya </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. There was nothing in particular to move market today, and participants were only `` adjusting their positions'' in trading currencies, he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 53.17 points Monday, slipped a modest 19.94 points, or 0.07 percent, today to move to 26,315.35 at the end of the day's trading. `` Market fundamentals are firm,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He said the small decline of the stock market's key indicator was prompted by participants having a wait-and-see attitude and profit-taking selling after a quick surge in early morning trade. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 92 points just 27 minutes into the seesion. Many investors stayed on the sidelines, cautious over what effect higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates may have on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stocks, another trader said. Share prices were mixed with the volume of the first section trade standing at a light 700 million shares, down from 1.1 billion shares Monday. Popular issues were textiles, foodstuffs and department stores. Among the losers were steel, shipbuilding, heavy electricals and some of the financials.

 A record $ 3 million libel award against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has refused to disturb is not likely to have widespread impact on the news media, says an authority on libel law. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the case does not establish a significant precedent because the facts involved are unique. But <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> did say that the case, stemming from a broadcast on a CBS-owned television station in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, changes the psychological landscape. `` This is the first libel award that has broken through the psychological $ 1 million barrier on appeal, the first that has been able to make it through the process intact,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, whose organization is funded by the news media, expressed disappointment along with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday left the libel judgment intact. News organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a First Amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. `` That opportunity has passed for the time being,'' he said. `` We're disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, associate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We believed these issues were important enough for review.'' The case stems from a suit by <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, which makes Viceroy cigarettes. It accused CBS and <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> of libeling it in a Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, in a nightly feature called `` <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s Perspective,'' said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes `` to pot, wine, beer and sex. He said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as `` an initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit pleasure.'' A federal jury awarded the cigarette company $ 5 million. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld $ 3 million of the award against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and $ 50,000 against <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. The $ 3 million award _ plus some $ 400,000 in interest _ is about four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news organization upheld on appeal. Awards upheld on appeal average between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> case, the appeals court rejected arguments that the broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous. The appeals court said the remarks about Viceroy were intended to be factual, even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like something else. The appeals court also rejected <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that the broadcast was truthful. There was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating cigarettes `` to pot, wine, beer and sex,'' the appeals court said. Finally, the appeals court ruled that <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> acted with `` actual malice'' in broadcasting the commentary. For a public figure to win a libel suit, it must be shown there was actual malice _ that statements were made with knowledge they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. The cigarette company was held to be a public figure.

<TEXT>
 Stock prices fell Tuesday, depressed by previous declines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and by the continuing strength of the British currency. Trading volume was light on the first day after the four-day Easter holiday. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was off 16.9 points, or 1 percent, at 1,725.6 at midday. Volume was a low 170.1 million shares, down from 175.0 million shares at midday Thursday. The market opened weaker on the back of previous declines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. After recovering a little during the morning, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market fell again as the pound resumed its recent rise against the West German mark. The rise has unsettled the equity market because of worries about its effect on the major exporting companies' stocks, which benefit from a weak pound.

<HEAD>Trade Journal: Japanese Imports Below Quota for '87 Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese automakers will fall short of their quota for car exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the fiscal year ended March 31, an industry trade journal says. Lagging sales by <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> will account for most of the shortfall, Automotive News predicted Monday The Japanese government limits its automakers' car exports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to 2.3 million a year. Automotive News predicted that a final tally of shipments will indicate a shortfall of 70,000 to 100,000 cars. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> shipped about 475,544 cars to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the 1987 fiscal year, about 66,200 below its allocation from the Japanese government, <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said, citing high inventories and slow sales of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> cars here. The Japanese government divides the total quota among exporting automakers, preventing companies that use their full allocation from shipping additional cars to take up the slack left by companies with slow sales. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import sales were off 17.2 percent from 1986 and had dropped a further 32.2 percent in 1988 as of February. Analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> sales have slipped recently because the automaker has introduced relatively few new products. Automotive News said <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which imports <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> cars, and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Subaru cars, were expected to have used their entire 1987 allocations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, has said that his company easily could sell more cars if it were allowed to use the left-over allocations of companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> had few unsold cars in their inventories, other makes had more than 50 days' worth, high for Japanese companies, and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> had an estimated 206 days' supply, the trade journal said. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, which sets the quota, is expected to maintain the 2.3 million level for fiscal 1988 despite pressure from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. The Big Three have called for a lower export quota to incorporate the growing number of Japanese cars built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> build cars here; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> will begin production this year in Bloomington-Normal, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> also will begin production this year at a new factory in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where it will build the Toyota Camry sedan, while <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> are building a joint-venture plant in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, These plants will have a combined capacity to build up to 2.5 million cars a year by 1990 at a time when the Big Three are closing plants because they have too much capacity.

 Directors of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spurned the latest takeover offer from entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, but formed a special panel to meet with <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to decide if an acceptable offer could be made. Although the action Monday appeared to open the door slightly to <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, Resorts Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who holds 88 percent of the company's voting power, also renewed his pledge not to sell his stock to the entertainer or to terminate a lucrative five-year management contract with the company. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also vowed to block efforts by <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to get the company to sell him 1.2 million new shares of Class B stock, which carries 100 votes per share. Such a move would give <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> more voting strength than <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns 95 percent of the company's current 572,000 Class B shares. The company also has 5.7 million shares of Class A stock, which carries one vote per share. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has said in the past that he would n't be interested in becoming partners with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is offering $ 36 a share for Resorts' Class A common shares and for the 1.2 million Class B shares that would be newly issued. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s holdings could be sold under the offer only if they were converted to Class A stock. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought his stock a year ago for $ 135 a share, but it has since lost much of its value. Last week, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> abandoned his own tender offer to buy the stock he does n't already own for $ 22 a share. Resorts said a special committee comprised of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and a Trump ally plus two outside directors would `` engage in discussions with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to explore whether an acceptable offer would be made.'' This is the first time that Resorts has indicated any willingness to hold talks with the entertainer's privately held investment company. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said he and the president of his company are to meet with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming officials next week on <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s takeover bid for Resorts. The meetings are the start of a licensing process that usually lasts a few weeks.

 The seven Japanese automakers' plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may cause 45,000 jobs to be lost in the domestic industry, far fewer than the number estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, a government study says. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study said that its estimate for job losses from 1985 through 1990 was based on worst-case assumptions, and the number of jobs actually lost could be less. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, requested by Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, R-Ill., placed the job loss at slightly less than a quarter the 200,000 lost jobs expected by the Imports, increased productivity and use of foreign parts will shrink the number of auto-industry jobs by 1990, according to the study, released Monday. `` The operations of Japanese-affiliated automakers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could result in even more losses because they use fewer workers and more foreign content than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers,'' the study said. Japanese auto plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were established in part to forestall protectionist legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers a chance to work in Japanese assembly plants. Japanese automakers have invested more than $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants since 1980. Besides the seven Japanese auto manufacturers, more than 100 Japanese auto parts suppliers operate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimate was based on what the study called unprovable assumptions about the extent to which U.S.-made Japanese autos cut into domestic manufacturing rather than displace imports. The worst-case estimate assumed 85 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production displaced production by the domestic automakers, a level the agency called `` relatively high.'' At a 70 percent displacement rate, the job loss shrinks to 17,000, and from 60 percent down the Japanese production creates more jobs than it eliminates, the study said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study also assumed half the Japanese makers' parts would be bought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production by Japanese makers would total 1.8 million vehicles in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> study produced a higher job-loss estimate because it assumed the Japanese manufacturers would build 2.2 million vehicles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, all of which would cut into domestic production, and would buy only 30 percent of their parts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s success in retailing home computers is not carrying over easily into the big-business market. The parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shack </ORGANIZATION> chain of electronics stores announced its big push into the Fortune 1000 last August and has relatively little to show for it so far. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are the only big customers that have so far allowed <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> to mention them by name. The Radio Shack name, a magnet in shopping malls, does not impress people who run corporate data centers. And some analysts believe the company lacks the technical and sales savvy to make it against industry giants like <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> has about 8 percent of the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer market, but only 2 to 3 percent of the Fortune 1000, according to <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based market researcher `` The old Radio Shack quality issue still hurts them,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Forrester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It's one thing to buy a tape deck that does n't work, but it's another thing to have the computer that you're running your company on break down.'' The knock on quality may be unjustified, based on independent evaluations. But Tandy still strikes some corporate buyers as a company for electronics hobbyists. Computers made up only about 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s business last year, outweighed by its sales of electronic parts and equipment, radios, telephones, video equipment, tape recorders, toys and communication equipment. Playing to its strengths, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> continues to focus most of its efforts on selling to small - and medium-sized companies, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Juge </PERSON>, the director of market planning, said in a recent interview `` We have not claimed to have made large inroads into the big corporate market. What we have said is that our level of penetration is much greater,'' <PERSON> Juge </PERSON> said. `` It's never been our intention to unseat <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Juge </PERSON> said members of the sales force are told that for every call they make on a Fortune 1000 company, they should be making about 70 calls to smaller companies. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s push to move in on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s established big-business market began in August 1987. It centered on creating <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> computer centers separate from the Radio Shack stores, spending $ 80 million to refurbish many of the 8,500 outlets and improving training for sales people. That sales force has encountered some resistance, but most companies are willing to try <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s systems, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s business products division. `` It has n't proven too difficult to have most of them take a unit for evaluation,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` If we can get them to compare our systems with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s, we compare very favorably.'' Some analysts say there is a perception in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> lacks equipment to connect its computers to each other. `` In the very large corporate market, connectivity becomes a very large issue,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, an analyst with Future Computing. `` When you think of networking or office integration, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> is not the first name that pops to mind.'' Last month <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to license its DeskMate interface to software developers, hoping to establish the look and feel of its personal computer screen as an industry standard. It said its computers can be easily hooked together in networks. But <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he thinks <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s problem has more to do with marketing than technology. `` Everything that's available in networking, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> has access to. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> has systems as good as any out there, but it needs to convince the large companies that it has quality products to offer,'' he said. `` Selling connected solutions in the next couple of years will be our thrust,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, noting the company's sales force has been successful in other areas. Sales at recently refurbished stores have risen about 4 percent faster than sales at stores that have not been refurbished, the company reported. Overall Tandy sales, meanwhile, improved to $ 3.66 billion in calendar year 1987, compared with $ 3.32 billion in 1986, and net income in 1987 improved to $ 289.8 million, compared with $ 216.4 million in 1986. Company executives also believe Fortune 500 companies, concerned about quality and value, will look at <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> products on an equal footing with other computer systems. `` The problem is simply one of penetration and presence,'' Future Computing's Cross said. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, when it came out with a personal computer, already had contacts with every company in the country with its mainframes.'' Industry rumors have it that <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> plans this month to unveil the first computer compatible with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2 computer, which was introduced in April 1987. Juge wo n't confirm or deny the rumor. The company has called a news conference for April 21 to introduce two products _ one a computer product and the other, `` an invention that will have impact on multiple areas in the electronics field.'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> waited to introduce high-end personal computers rather than put an inferior product on the market. `` We have a very broad-based distribution network and many repeat customers,'' he said. `` Often we will elect not to carry a product because we feel like some percentage of the market will not be happy with it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> also has begun fighting for a share of the market in portable laptop computers that can perform many of the same functions as an IBM-compatible desk unit. To help the company compete in the tough laptop market, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> recently purchased <ORGANIZATION> Grid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for $ 55 million. Grid, which designs, manufactures and markets rugged, magnesium-cased portable microcomputers, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>.

 Corporate raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> may not have hit pay dirt when prospecting for targets among gold companies, but that does n't necessarily mean he's lost his Midas touch. Last month, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> ditched its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after the company rejected a $ 1.88 billion buyout offer. An earlier Pickens-led run for <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also failed to pan out. `` The environment for takeovers and some of the rules have changed, but do n't ever shortchange this guy,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, vice president for <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. `` He's plenty savvy. That savvy helped <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> parlay a $ 2,500 investment into one of the nation's largest independent oil companies. It also earned the takeover artist who champions shareholder rights a reputation for making top executives squirm in their boardroom swivel chairs. `` Chief executives, who themselves own few shares of their companies, have no more feeling for the average shareholder than they do for baboons in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> once said. But executives are n't the only people who bristle at <LOCATION> Pickens </LOCATION>. Residents here sometimes dislike <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' dealings in his hometown, where his moniker is `` Attila of <PERSON> Amarilla </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was a behind-the-scenes mover in a group attacking the <ORGANIZATION> Amarillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe-News </ORGANIZATION> for negative coverage. After the group rallied and pulled advertising from the paper last autumn, the newspaper's general manager, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, announced his departure <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' forces celebrated their victory by draping a yellow banner that read `` Goodbye <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'' on the side of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s downtown building. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' multimillion-dollar endowment to <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school and position as board of regents chairman have n't won him many friends at the Canyon college, either. Some students and faculty have called for the ouster of president <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pickens </ORGANIZATION> candidate, and of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> himself. The two have been lampooned repeatedly in an underground newsletter published by faculty members. After the newspaper controversy and amid unrest at <ORGANIZATION> WTSU </ORGANIZATION>, reports surfaced that <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> may move his $ 315.3 million company from this Panhandle city of 195,000 to a larger <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' right-hand man, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, announced last week he is making his own move: to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he will start his own consulting firm. `` It's a significant sacrifice to live in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, comparing the city to `` a large truck stop.'' Analysts, meanwhile, say that although the 59-year-old <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has n't made stock market killings on the order of those past, he has n't lost his touch. `` Most of these -LRB- recent takeover attempts -RRB- for one reason or another have been unsuccessful, and that has I think created this image of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> being unsuccessful investors,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehl </PERSON>, who estimated <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> racked up $ 10 million in market profits last year. `` But I think they've had a lot of small, nice gains which over the course of time will add up,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> failed to return more than a dozen telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' 1987 dealings pale in comparison to his earlier conquests in the oil industry. In 1982 he reaped $ 31.5 million for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> after launching an attack on <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that resulted in a buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He followed that with a string of unsuccessful but profitable bids for <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, from which he gleaned more than $ 500 million; <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' 1986 bid for Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> forced a drastic restructuring of the company, splitting it into a refining and marketing company, <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M, and an exploration company, <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> still made several million dollars on that Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ivanhoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a Pickens-led investment group, made a $ 2 billion hostile bid to control New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>, a gold and uranium mining concern with interests in oil and natural gas. A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court thwarted the bid when it refused to rule illegal a `` market sweep'' in which <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, bought enough shares in a two-day September binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> and stave off the hostile bid. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's largest gold producers, recently rejected <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s offer to negotiate a buyout for $ 20 a share in cash. `` Admittedly, he has n't made a major killing in the stock market since <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, but they -LRB- <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> -RRB- have been very active investors,'' <PERSON> Kehl </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> is sort of two companies _ it's a gas producer and it's an investment company, and they've been in and out of many different stocks in the last year.'' Among his ongoing interests, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has thrice tried to buy <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, gas pipeline company, and he could take an active role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the former sewing machine maker-turned-defense electronics firm. <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> helped finance corporate raider <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s post-crash takeover of Singer by chipping in the last $ 150 million needed for the buyout. Fortune magazine reported that <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' conditions dictate that <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> must repay <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> within 15 months or <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> may take control of Singer's board. Analysts say <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s investments in Singer and other companies have enhanced the limited partnership's financial picture, but <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> may be stretching to pay its cash distributions this month. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s dividends have exceeded its operating cash flow, with the difference coming from the partnership's sizable investment holdings and lines of credit, <PERSON> Kehl </PERSON> said. But other analysts say that cash distributions may be cut soon to ease the burden for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, which had 1987 earnings of $ 31.9 million, down 12 percent from 1986, on revenues of $ 315.3 million. While <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is still acknowledged as a wily investor, companies have learned to fight back, and market conditions have become tougher for speculators like <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, market experts contend. `` After the stock market broke, the stock market players began to realize that you can win _ and lose _ at this game,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimmerlik </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 Boom times went bust here in the 1980s, yet glitzy, upscale shopping malls keep popping up along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, in the suburbs and in the shadow of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome. Some might say it's crazy to build retail developments in a city going through a slump often compared to the Great Depression. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> says its good business. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> is the regional development director for the <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeBartolo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is building the 8,000-square-foot, $ 100 million complex that will open next to the Superdome in August. It will compete for attention with the new Galleria in suburban <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, the year-old Riverwalk on the riverside site of the 1984 world's fair, Canal Place at the foot of the city's major thoroughfare and at least five other shopping developments that have been constructed or expanded in the area since 1980. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the failure of the oil economy in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which hit just as <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centre </LOCATION> was being planned, did not give his company second thoughts about the project. `` Frankly this has seemed like a very solid idea all along. We have a great location, and we're bringing in <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, two stores that people from this area have always traveled to other cities to shop in,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. For years, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> residents planned trips to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and other cities to shop, according to <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s economic development department. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was grossly under-retailed in the past,'' she explained. `` In 1980, our per-capita income surpassed the national average. That sent up a red flag that got a lot of attention from national retailers who had previously ignored <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' As retailers began to plan and build new shopping facilities in the area, however, the oil-based economy began to falter. The price of oil plummeted, oil-related businesses failed, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate soared above 14 percent In 1985, when the first phase of the Esplanade Mall opened, the economy was still in good shape. But by the time the second phase opened in 1986, mall general manager <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Grondin </PERSON> said things had changed radically. `` I wondered for a while if I'd be looking for another job myself,'' he said. `` We had a slow period, which is normal for a new mall, but I was reading all the negative economic news in the papers at that time, and I was worried.'' Mall managers and developers remain resolutely confident, however. While the local economy is still slow, most feel there are definite signs of recovery. `` The important thing about economic forecasts,'' <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said, `` is expectation. Expectation was very bad while oil prices were fluctuating. Now that they're fairly stable, even though they're not as high as people would like, things are improving. Another factor that's helping the local economy is tourism, and for the new shopping centers in the area, that's a two-way street. `` Definitely. We see people making trips here just to shop,'' <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianna </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We also see the effect of the new shopping opportunities on our convention trade. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is now No. 1 for spouse attendance at conventions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'm sure having all these great stores is one reason for that.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> agrees, saying now that national merchants are opening here, local folks are shopping at home, and tourists are in those same stores. `` That's not only keeping that money in the local economy, it's bringing it into the city from other areas Let's face it, if you live in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and you have a chance to go to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for a weekend of shopping, it's an easy choice. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> can now offer both the French Quarter and the stores people want. Where do you think people are going to be going?''

 Grain and soybean futures prices weakened this morning after a sharp rally in beans Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market moved higher today as a technical rally took hold, but light volume indicated market participants may be half-hearted in their enthusiasm for equities. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 13.10 to 1,993.70 at noon on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 13 to 9 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 773 up, 525 down and 52 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 63.78 million shares at midday. The Dow pierced the 2,000 mark at midmorning but then met with considerable resistance. `` This is the fourth time in the last week or so that the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> has tried to get up above the 2,000 level and has not made it,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daino </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The internal market is not showing much enthusiasm,'' he said, adding that the light volume indicated traders remain cautious. The market drew strength from a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, but traders said big institutional investors were not willing to commit themselves to equities and remain on the sidelines.

<TEXT>
 Corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has filed an appeal of a federal bankruptcy judge's approval of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan. But <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the filing, done late Friday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, will not stop the $ 5.6 billion plan, set to begin Thursday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, said he still opposed to two key parts of the plan. One was the release from any legal liabilities of all the participants in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s ill-fated 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He also opposed a default provision in a loan of up to $ 3 billion which <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will use to help fund the reorganization. Under a provision of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with a consortium of banks providing the money, the loans would be callable if more than half of its 14-member board is replaced by new directors, or if an investor obtains 30 percent of the company's stock. Two-thirds of the banks must vote to force <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to pay back the money, however. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 12 last year, claiming it was forced to do so to avoid having to pay a potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while appealing a $ 10.3 billion judgment held against it by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> won the judgment when a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had improperly interfered with a <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> attempt to acquire part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and bought <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself

<HEAD>Reorganization Plan for First City Vital for Its Survival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 1.5 billion reorganization plan for troubled <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is crucial to the company's survival, documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> indicate The bailout plan is being held up by debt-holders who are refusing to tender their securities for less than face value. First City has extended its tendering deadline for a fourth time and lowered the participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors are convinced that the company has no realistic alternative to the reorganization, and that the plan's failure would eventually mean the bank's failure. In an accompanying letter to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s operating losses for 1987 and 1988 have continued, credit quality has deteriorated and that the bank has borrowed substantially from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the reorganization is not successfully completed, these factors, among others, will create a substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue in existence,'' the letter said. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> also reported in the company's 10K report with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last week that it expects a $ 43 million loss by the time the reorganization plan is completed. The expected loss in 1988 represents a continuing deterioration of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s loan portfolio, plus operating losses and non-recurring charges related to the federally assisted rescue plan. In the first quarter of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> recorded a loss of $ 44.5 million, and it lost $ 232.4 million during the same quarter in 1986. For all of 1987, the company posted a loss of $ 1.13 billion, compared to a loss of $ 402 million in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> had forecast a $ 1.1 billion loss for 1987, based on an expected $ 852 million fourth-quarter deficit. But the company's fourth-quarter loss rose to $ 861 million <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. The bailout plan for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' fourth-largest bank-holding company calls for $ 970 million in assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by a group headed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who would become chairman under the plan, and a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets. First City extended its deadline for the tender offer until April 12 after only 62 percent, or $ 140 million, of the bank's $ 225.8 million in bonds had been tendered by March 29 Under the arrangement, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been offered 35 cents.

 The stock market reversed an early technical rally today, but light volume indicated the downturn was far from dramatic. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen as much as 20 points earlier in the session, was up 0.34 to 1,980.94 at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 726 down, 669 up and 501 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 95.25 million shares at midafternoon. The Dow pierced the 2,000 mark at midmorning but then met with considerable resistance.

<HEAD>Placement Pro Says It's a Tough Year for College Grads</HEAD>

 New college graduates this spring will face a tight job market, with competition-conscious companies less willing to offer extended on-the-job training, a veteran placement professional says. `` Employers, especially small - and medium-size companies which represent the areas of greatest job growth, today have neither the time nor inclination to ` bring somebody along' gradually,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Challenger </PERSON>, president of Chicago-based Challenger, <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which descibes itself as the nation's oldest outplacement firm `` Now, you either sink or swim, right away.'' An increasingly competitive marketplace is facing all companies, <PERSON> Challenger </PERSON> said in an analysis of the 1988 college graduate job outlook, released Monday. `` As a result, many of the larger firms have instituted corporate downsizing to pare their overhead and operating expenses, which has not only eliminated or combined many existing jobs but also prevented the creation of many new entry-level jobs. `` The two-year training programs for beginners are among casualties of world market competition,'' he said. `` Companies want results now, not in two years.'' Challenger, 62, founded his firm in 1962 and says it has helped more than 20,000 people who have lost jobs find employment. The firm has 14 regional offices in cities including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>. Challenger said the job market wo n't favor most graduates because companies are more selective. He said early indications suggest that fewer than the usual one-third of students getting four-year degrees will have jobs lined up when they receive diplomas. College placement officials say that just 20 percent to 25 percent of students graduating have jobs set, but things could change by the end of May, Challenger said in a telephone interview. The graduates likely to have the most luck finding positions are `` the A students and those with specialty degrees such as engineering or accounting,'' or those going into sales, Challenger said. `` Companies are always willing to take on sales trainees'' because many sales jobs are low-salary or operate on commission, he said. Some students are taking unpaid internships to obtain good jobs, Challenger said. Others may have to take part-time work as they search for permanent positions. Some placement experts disagree with Challenger's assessment. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, director of placement for <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, said his survey of employers indicates a better employment year spring graduates. He said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the university's survey last fall forecast a 10 percent increase in new-graduate employment over the previous year <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> agreed that takeovers and corporate restructurings have heightened competition for new jobs. `` If you were making $ 35,000 and you're offered $ 30,000 you might not like it, but it's better than unemployment,'' said <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>. But at the same time, he said, many companies `` are very, very heavily in the market -LRB- for new employees -RRB- and have made a big commitment to training. `` Not having a job by commencement is not necessarily the end of the world,'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said. `` There'll be more kids hired in June, July, August and September than there probably were in the previous four months. And there's nothing at all unusual about that.''

 Wheat futures rallied sharply and most other grain and soybean contracts also were higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market was slightly higher after slipping from an early technical rally today, but light volume indicated traders were short on conviction. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen as much as 20 points earlier in the session, was up 5.97 to 1,986.57 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

 The dollar surged higher against major foreign currencies Tuesday as traders decided Japanese investors were unlikely to unload dollars. Gold prices fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 452.65 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 455.85 late Monday. The dollar climbed about 1 percent against the West German mark, British pound and Japanese yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's strength prompted people who had been betting on a dollar decline to retreat by buying dollars to cover short positions. That contributed to the dollar's rally. The dollar had been depressed in March by fears that Japanese trust funds and securities firms would lighten their dollar holdings starting April 1 because they would no longer need to support it for accounting purposes. When Japanese dollar-selling failed to materialize, investors took courage, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Dollar buyers were also encouraged by news reports that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> expressed a strong desire to lower inflation, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gloyne </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tried to combat inflation through higher interest rates, it would raise the yield of dollar-denominated securities and make foreigners want to buy dollars. Interest rates finished Tuesday little changed. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.58 yen to a close at 124.43 yen, compared with 123.85 on Monday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 125.15 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 125.28 yen, up from 124.18 yen late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8800 from $ 1.8895 on Good Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.8790 from $ 1.8857 late Monday. There was spotty foreign-exchange trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday but no precious metals trading. The European financial markets were closed on Monday for the Easter holiday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's rates, were: 1.6706 West German marks, up from 1.6540; 1.3769 Swiss francs, up from 1.3639; 1.2418 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2370; 5.6645 French francs, up from 5.6085; and 1,237.75 Italian lire, up from 1,227.25 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's rates: 1.6690 West German marks, up from 1.6565; 1.3765 Swiss francs, up from 1.3635; 5.6605 French francs, up from 5.6270; 1.8700 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8595; 1,234.50 Italian lire, up from 1,228.75; 1.2395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2335. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at $ 453.40 a troy ounce, down from $ 456.70 late Monday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 451.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 454.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell, closing at a bid $ 453.50 an ounce compared with $ 457.50 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold markets were closed because of a public holiday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was bid at $ 6.65 an ounce, down from $ 6.789 an ounce late Monday.

<HEAD>Eastern, Continental Cut Some Air Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Two units of fare-wars veteran <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fired a spring salvo Tuesday by announcing price cuts on tickets purchased by April 14. The subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, may touch off a price skirmish only a few weeks after all the major carriers hiked fares steeply. But the cuts _ limited by the purchase-period requirements and hemmed in by other restrictions _ stop short of a full-fledged price war. Although observers believe the reductions made by Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are likely to be matched by other major airlines, they do n't see a major fare battle on the horizon. `` It's definitely not a fare war; it's barely a skirmish,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst for investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. If anything, the current climate for the industry appears to favor fare hikes rather than reductions. The major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers have posted an average increase in passenger traffic of 7 percent to 8 percent since New Year's Day from the same period last year. The robust demand prompted the big airlines to raise their first-class, economy and discount fares in mid-March by 15 percent to 85 percent, depending on the destination. The carriers also tightened restrictions on their popular `` MaxSaver'' discount fares, the cheapest available. The big fare hikes came several weeks before they normally do, as the airlines jumped the gun on the peak travel season that starts in April. Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth-largest and fifth-ranked airlines, respectively, said Tuesday they were cutting some fares in anticipation of a slack period coming up for leisure travel. `` The period between Easter and the start of summer vacations in mid-June is always a slack travel time, and an early Easter extends the off-peak period this year,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, vice president of marketing communications for Eastern. `` We hope to give leisure travel a boost with fares so low that people will take a trip they might not otherwise plan.'' With the new fares, the airline said, passengers will be able to fly midweek to more than 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities on Eastern for a maximum of $ 99 one way -LRB- based on a round-trip tariff of $ 198 -RRB-. Eastern's round-trip fare between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for example, will fall to $ 178 under the program, compared with the current `` MaxSaver'' fare of $ 208 Although there are some minor differences, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> introduced similar programs. The non-refundable tickets must be purchased by April 14 -LRB- starting Tuesday for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Wednesday for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and used for travel from April 18 through June 15. Passengers must travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday. Round-trip travel and a Saturday night stay are required. Those restrictions limit the program to eight travel days in April, 18 days in May and nine in June. And there are still more restrictions. For Eastern, tickets must be bought within 24 hours after making reservations. Continental is even stricter: It requires reservations and ticketing to be done at the same time. Both airlines prohibit schedule changes to be made the special fares and limit the number of available seats on each flight. `` It's pretty savvy of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a transportation analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It very effectively cancels out every businessperson'' from using the new fares. <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> suggested that the reduced tariffs could encourage people who had planned vacations to take them within the specified time frames.

The stock fell $ 1.37 -LCB- a share on Monday and dropped another $ 3.75 to close at $ 46.50 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> bought 54 percent of <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s stock, or 694,000 shares, for $ 41.6 million while Hallmark bought the remaining 600,600 shares for $ 36 million. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> had proposed a friendly buyout of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> shares that his group did n't own for $ 587.6 million, or $ 60 a share. After the company spurned the offer, <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> threatened a proxy battle to name two of his group to the board of directors at <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting May 3. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Spar </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>, said the investor agreed to sell because he could not convince <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> to accept his plans for gaining control of the company. `` There were several discussions with management, but we came to the conclusion that we would not be able to go forward on a friendly basis,'' he said. Hallmark's purchase will make it <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest stockholder, with 1.04 million shares, or 9.4 percent of those outstanding. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> greeting card giant said it liked <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term prospects and did not plan to take control. Hallmark previously owned 4 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s stock <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hockaday </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of Hallmark, held a smiliar post at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City Southern from 1981 until 1983. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wineland </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Waddell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the premium price paid to <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> reflected the threat he posed to the company. `` It's called greenmail. Just on the face, you'd have to say it was worth that much to get <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> out of the way,'' <PERSON> Wineland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, of the investment firm C.J. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called the deal `` the most blatant case of greenmail I've seen in a long time.'' He said the price Hallmark paid for the stock was not justified by <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s expected earnings <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION>'s main holding is the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 14th largest railroad.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Move Lower</HEAD>

 Energy futures retreated Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, depressed by what are regarded as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ineffectual moves to stabilize the market. Among other commodities, precious metals declined, wheat futures rallied sharply and livestock closed on a firm note. The oil market had a case of the jitters over a planned meeting Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' pricing committee <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said their had been speculation early in the day that the meeting would be called off. This was quickly denied, but the reaffirmation that the meeting was on did n't seem to put much inspiration into the market. `` Obviously if the meeting is not on, this would be more negative for the market. But the bottom line is what the meeting will accomplish _ essentially nothing but propaganda,'' said <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>. `` The perception is that whether the meeting is on or not, it's not really going to accomplish anything.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee probably will probably end up blaming non-OPEC producers for the turmoil in the market, rather than making any moves to bring some firmness to prices. `` It'll take a little more than that to bring some stability,'' he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 14 cents to 22 cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 16.79 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 45.20 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to .71 cent lower with May at 48.64 cents a gallon. Precious metals prices gave back Monday's gains and then some on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Events of the day `` defused inflationary expectations,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The market weakened early on the strength of the dollar, she said. `` Then,'' she said, `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> governor -RRB- <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> talked about last week's favorable unemployment data not really being that inflationary. And he felt inflation should be lower.'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> referred to data released Friday showing the jobless rate at 5.6 percent, the lowest since 1979. Ms. <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON> also noted that lower energy futures and a weakened CRB Index also pointed toward lower inflation. Gold settled $ 3.30 to $ 3.60 lower with the June contract at $ 456.20 a troy ounce; and silver was 14 cents to 14.6 cents lower with May at $ 6.685 a troy ounce. Wheat futures rallied sharply and most other grain and soybean contracts also were higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat showed a little early enthusiasm, reflecting coming export business and an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was authorized 1 million tons of subsidized wheat, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But the market took a sharp turn upward when a professional fund manager bought a huge amount of wheat. `` They probably bought a total of 20 million bushels,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They apparently were trying to get a positive trend going.'' Wheat settled 6 \ cents to 8 -RCB- cents higher with the May contract at $ 3.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.08 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with May at $ 1.66 a bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.70 -RCB- a bushel Cattle futures recovered from Monday's sharp losses on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said trading `` began real nervous,'' opening lower then falling even more. But the downturn did n't take hold and `` the market finished higher and fairly firm,'' he said. Much of Tuesday's selling was profit taking, rather than an indication of some fundamental weakness in the market, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> added. Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .73 cent higher with the April contract at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15 cent higher with April at 79.55 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .25 cent higher with April at 45.42 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.80 cents lower to .13 cent higher with May at 53.20 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.55 points higher at 259.50. The underlying spot index closed 2.42 points higher at 258.51.

 The stock market spun into a late rally Tuesday after seesawing in a directionless session marked by low volume and investor caution. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 16.91 points to 1,997.51. Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 911 up, 585 down and 467 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 135.29 million shares, against 182.24 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index rose 1.12 to 146.29. The Dow average dipped into negative territory at midday as traders moved to cash in on an early technical rally that pushed the key index up about 20 points in the first few hours of activity. But analysts were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the market's overall tone because trading volume remained among the lightest levels so far this year. `` The overriding issue is that the volume is not particularly convincing, and that's leaving the market fairly directionless,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, there was `` a lack of strong fundamentals to sustain a move in either direction,'' he added. Analysts said professional traders were the main players in the market, with individual and institutional investors remaining on the sidelines while they await clearer signals on state of the overall economy. Traders are more interested in capitalizing on short-term movements, while investors typically take a longer-term view of the market, noted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is one of those low-conviction markets where traders dominate the arena,'' he said. Much of the session's activity centered on F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>, a component of the Dow average and the most active issue of the day. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> finished up 2 -LCB- at 56 | after jumping 8 ~ on Monday, when <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it was interested in acquiring a stake in the <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> had been up as much as 4 during the session, but fell back amid profit-taking. Analysts said the stock's movements had a fairly significant impact on the Dow throughout the day. Among other actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 107 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was up -LCB- to 40 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 44 -LCB- <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, the target of a takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, fell 1 to 56 \ Airline issues were mixed amid analysts' speculation that carriers would move to match lower discount fares announced by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> units. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 42 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> fell -RCB- to 51; <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 82 ~ and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> rose -LRB- to 2 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 19.67 billion, or 0.77 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 158.46 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.02 to 300.17, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 to 258.51. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index rose .06 to 295.07. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 373.41, up 1.52.
