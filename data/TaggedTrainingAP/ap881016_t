<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fought to make up ground on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Saturday, declaring he has reduced home-state crime through a commitment `` right out of my gut'' while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> merely postures on TV. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, leading the presidential race with just over three weeks to go, said, `` I'm not going to mess up.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received endorsements from Hispanic law-enforcement groups in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and spoke at a rally there before flying to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for more campaigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accompanied by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> actors and two of the Beach Boys singing group, led a bus tour of rallies in seven <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, said Saturday that despite polls showing Republican gains `` the momentum is ours.'' But he also brought up a story generally cited only by political longshots _ the 1948 newspaper headline incorrectly declaring Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> had defeated Democratic underdog <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. `` I ca n't help but remember <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> out there when the press had written him off,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a crowd at a farmers' market in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> managers held a day-long meeting in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and set out an 18-state strategy, focusing largely on economic issues, for improving the Democratic nominee's election chances, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. `` The issues at stake are too important for the press and the Republicans to shut this election down three weeks before it happened,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. Under the strategy, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign plans an `` all-out'' drive in 18 states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is favored or competitive, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. Those 18 states collectively have 272 electoral votes _ two more than needed to be elected. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, telling cheering supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> that the state `` is going for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>, he ran into demonstrators carrying signs questioning his military record. He brushed past them, saying, `` See you after the election.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff welcomed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a rally and presented him with a green medical uniform sporting the words `` Dr. Spin,'' in keeping with the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's vow to give his own `` spin,'' or interpretation, to campaign developments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been striking back aggressively since Thursday night's debate, an encounter that polls indicate put him farther behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He also has been hurt by tough <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> television ads accusing him of presiding over a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner-furlough system that gave a weekend pass to a murderer who later attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said little about such charges for weeks but now addresses them vigorously and at length. On Saturday, he called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` cynical and hypocritical'' for seeking political gain from what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> calls a tragic incident. He spoke of murders in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by inmates on furlough during <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s governorship. And he said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been vice president there have been thousands of federal prison furloughs and an incident last year in which an inmate on furlough raped and murdered a mother of two in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also speaks of a murder and rape committed by a man who escaped from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> halfway house <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported. The governor said that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took responsibility for their programs but that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to take blame for his failures. `` Talk versus action, TV commercials versus results, that's what we're dealing with here,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, comparing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and himself. He noted his state's 14 percent decline in the rate of major crime, and its lowest homicide rate among industrial states. That progress, he said, resulted from his personal involvement in a statewide anti-crime council. `` I did n't learn my lessons about crime from a <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> movie,'' he told the law-enforcement officers. `` I've been out there with you.'' `` This is an issue that is very close to me,'' he said. `` It comes right out of my gut.'' In his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appearance, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke warmly of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator who is his running mate. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I have formed a partnership _ a partnership for the future, a partnership that will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first economically and militarily,'' he said at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> rally. `` The two go hand in hand. You ca n't have one without the other and we'll have neither if we elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to lead our country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> all week, campaigned Saturday with actors <ORGANIZATION> Telly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savalas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and singers <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of the Beach Boys. He told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was going to `` go the extra mile to fight hard'' in the final 24 days of the race and would n't `` mess up.'' `` We're going to take the high road and leave the pessimism and the tearing down of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to somebody else,'' he said. `` Here we go ... entering the home stretch of this national presidential election,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared at a noisy kickoff rally in an airport hangar in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>. He is pushing for an advantage in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the election is still considered too close to call. In particular, he is trying to energize Republicans and to keep the support of Democrats who may have dropped their allegiance in order to vote for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used his weekly radio address to praise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and ask voters to support Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. `` If we do n't want a tax-and-spend liberal in the White House, should n't we give the president a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that will work with him?'' he asked. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, giving the Democrats' response, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would do more than the Republicans to answer Americans' most pressing concerns. He dismissed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a silent partner'' in a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` riddled with corruption, corruption that has reached into the president's cabinet, to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, from defense contractors to Wall Street.''

 Two masked men in overalls burst into a pub in east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Saturday, shooting to death a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary leader and another man and wounding four others, police said. Police identified one of the dead men as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. British television reports named him as a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The second dead man was identified as <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Raimey </PERSON>'s age was unknown. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> seeks to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the neighboring <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Police said the gunmen, wearing blue overalls, entered the Castle Inn in the heart of Protestant east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and ordered the customers to lie on the floor. The gunmen then opened fire indiscriminately and fled, the police said, adding that at least one of the wounded was in critical condition. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have been accused of taking part in racketeering throughout the province. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and two other suspects appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 on 33 charges related to extortion of money from building contractors. However, the charges were later dropped. In the last 10 months, two leading members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have been slain. Vice Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMichael </PERSON> was killed last Christmas by a booby trap bomb attached to his car outside his home in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antrim </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quee </PERSON> was shot to death Sept. 7 outside his grocery store. In the border area near the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, meanwhile, police said a gun and grenade attack was launched on the Royal Ulster Constabulary station at <LOCATION> Lurgan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, causing slight damage but no injuries. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Resistance leaders rejected an invitation Saturday to join fellow rebels who say they are ready to talk about peace with the government and lay down their arms. Those who formed the new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> coalition are `` pseudo-leaders,'' said Nicaraguan rebel <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> in a recorded interview. Members of the Nicaraguan Resistance in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the umbrella group for the rebels or Contras, played it for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The new coalition of some Nicaraguan Resistance leaders was announced Friday. At a press conference in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the group will propose a Nicaraguan peace plan to the leftist Sandinista government that will complement a regional plan proposed by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> coalition is `` a new effort to trick the rebels which will only help consolidate -LRB- the power of -RRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> directorate </ORGANIZATION> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> coalition is not breaking away from the Nicaraguan Resistance. He said it will try to win over other members to its ideas. The new group includes four political opposition parties, in addition to <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>'s Southern Opposition Block. However, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> discounted the group's importance. `` It acts as infiltrators to undermine the resistance,'' he said. One rebel official involved in the coalition said the new group was formed in part with an eye to the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which has backed the rebels since 1981 in their bid to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The two sides agreed March 21 to begin a truce, which has been periodically extended despite complaints of violations from both sides. Talks have remained at an impasse, particularly over the Sadinista demand that the rebels give up their arms as part of a permanent peace.

<HEAD>Survey: One In Six Britons Can't Find Own Country on Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One in six Britons questioned in a survey could n't find his own country on a map, and more than 40 percent had a big problem figuring a simple restaurant check, a newspaper reported Sunday One person even thought President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leads <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, although 90 percent correctly identified the opposition leader as <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, the survey found The survey of 994 people, published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted last month by Market and <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper commissioned it to test knowledge of geography, mathematics, common foreign language phrases, spelling, history, science and current affairs. The newspaper said the 18-question test was `` simple,'' but `` many of the replies were enough to break traditional teachers' hearts. The survey found 83 percent of the sample population could find <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on a world map, but 7 percent had no idea where to look. Others placed it off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Asked to spell `` embarrass,'' `` satellite'' and `` exercise,'' one in 10 immediately `` threw up their hands in defeat,'' the newspaper said. Fifty-nine percent spelled `` embarrass'' and `` satellite'' incorrectly, and 28 percent failed `` exercise.'' Mathematics added to the problem, the newspaper said. Asked to add menu prices for the total cost of a hamburger, french fries, apple pie and coffee, 42 percent got it wrong or were unable to try. People aged 15-24 fared the worst in the survey, the newspaper said, and women generally did worse than men, except in spelling. Professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargreaves </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying the poor results by young people showed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was `` in danger of producing a generation of ignoramuses.'' Education Minister <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbold </PERSON> was quoted as describing the results as `` most depressing.'' In July, the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> released results of a geographic literacy test that showed that the Britons polled placed seventh among the nine countries surveyed. Americans tested finished sixth in the survey. Three out of four Americans in the Gallup survey could n't locate the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, most had no idea of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and the majority were lost when it came to finding <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Communist Says KGB Could Learn Something From FBI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police could learn from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> by telling Soviet citizens when they are being followed or monitored by its agents, one <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member says. The campaign for `` glasnost,'' or openness on selected topics, has allowed the publication of some unusual items in Soviet media recently. But a letter in the latest issue of the Ogonyok weekly is believed to be the first suggestion to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police officers to look to the West for inspiration. Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the government reportedly is working on a new statute regulating the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> from its Russian-language initials. But the powerful and secretive agency itself remains virtually above criticism in the state-run press. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachkov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, who identified himself as a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, wrote to tell the weekly that one of his friends, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON>, started to wonder why he was never sent abroad on business trips by the government agency he works for. When <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> signed up for a tourist trip to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the vacation reservations were canceled two days before departure `` under a clearly invented pretext,'' <PERSON> Rachkov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> came to believe that someone made a `` slanderous report'' about him to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> that ruined his chances of ever traveling outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But he had no way of making anyone in authority tell him whether his belief was true, <PERSON> Rachkov </PERSON> said. `` He could n't penetrate the wall by banging against it with his head,'' <PERSON> Rachkov </PERSON> said. By contrast, the <PERSON> Muscovite </PERSON> wrote, a recent Soviet press report said an American who thought he was being followed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sent the bureau an official request to explain its actions. `` After a time, he received a reply containing an official notice that a file had been opened about his ` anti-American activities,''' <PERSON> Rachkov </PERSON> said. `` Maybe I'm mistaken, but it seems to me that this is a proof of democratization,'' the Soviet wrote. `` Moreover, I'd like to suggest that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> legalize in this country, too, the same possibility of sending a formal request to the -LRB- government -RRB- organs, so that a citizen of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> could protect himself, if necessary, against false reports and arbitrary sanctions.''

 Vandals bombed and destroyed a statue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> on an island where he led Allied troops retaking the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during World War II, police said Sunday. The 10-foot statue of marble, granite and cement fell to the ground face down. Most of it was blasted to pieces by the explosive device, which police had not identified. The bombing occurred before dawn Saturday at <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> town on the central island of <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION>, about 350 miles from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported that the blast was heard more than seven miles away. The statue was one of six erected in 1976 on the shores of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> to commemorate the <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> landing, but only <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>'s statue was damaged. The bombing occurred five days before the 44th anniversary of the landing of Allied forces he commanded. Their return fulfilled the famous pledge `` I shall return,'' which <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> made to Filipinos when his troops fled Japanese attackers at the beginning of the war. No suspects were caught in the bombing, and no motive was discovered. However, the island is a stronghold of communist rebels who have been fighting the national government for two decades.

<TEXT>
 Rival Moslem militias fired mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in a five-hour clash in which six people died and 25 others were wounded, police said Sunday. They said Saturday night's firefight between Syrian-backed Amal militia and militants of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> _ the first major clash between the two groups in nearly five months _ ignited blazes in numerous apartment buildings in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Syrian soldiers deployed in densely populated districts of <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> stopped the fighting. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God; and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for Hope, have been vying for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> stationed troops to the devastated suburbs on May 27 to put an end to a three-week bloody confrontation between the two militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded. It was not immediately known what set off the clash. Each side accused the other of starting it. The conservative Ad-Diyar daily quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> source as saying <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militants kidnapped five members of Amal and released them several hours later after beating them. The source said two were hospitalized with various injuries. The same newspaper, based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> sources as saying the fighting erupted when <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militants tried to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen from raiding an apartment belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> `` sympathizers,'' claiming they wanted to search the flat. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> sources said the Amal fighters fired a rocket into the apartment when the Hezbollahis tried to defend themselves, the newspaper said. There was no way to confirm either report.

In addition, the president suspended all hearings before the special courts set up to try the youths, most of whom were arrested for looting and acts of vandalism during the unrest that began Oct. 4. The government has said 180 people died in the rioting, but unofficials reports said at least 500 people died and more than 1,000 were injured. The government also ordered the release Sunday of all those imprisoned during the unrest who were not directly involved in the revolt and those `` arrested for crimes of opinion.'' More than 3,000 people were reported arrested in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and provincial cities during the riots over shortages, high food prices and the government's program of austerity and economic reform. Schools reopened Saturday, and the country was relatively calm. Those still held in prison will `` benefit fully of the rights of defense in accordance with the law,'' the government said. `` No judgment will be pronounced other than in the strict respect of legality.'' <PERSON> Miloud </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahimi </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, last week protested the special tribunals, which he charged with violating the fundamental rights of presumed innocence. Also on Sunday, Interior Minister <PERSON> El-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> announced a nationwide revision of electoral lists as a first step to the Nov. 3 referendum that is to launch Bendjedid's program to democratize his country. In the referendum, the citizens will be asked to approve a revision of the constitution that would make the future prime minister answerable to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Other, more far-reaching reforms are to be discussed in December at the national congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. No one except foreign-based opposition groups has publicly proposed the introduction of a multiparty system. The official <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the referendum `` introduces the fundamental problem of the full participation in the political life of the country for all citizens.'' The news agency said the reforms to be introduced would permit the removal of top officials `` who have impeded the changes by inertia or incompetence.'' One of the likely victims of these changes is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherif </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaadia </PERSON>, who has not been heard from publicly for nearly two weeks. Many other personnel changes are expected in the government, including the possible replacement of Prime Minister <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahimi </PERSON>.

 It's been a down-and-dirty presidential campaign, from gleeful Democratic denunciations of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a wimp to the Republicans' skewering of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over crime, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and the Pledge of Allegiance. While the dismal tenor of this year's campaign discourse has elicited groans from past presidents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, political analysts credit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with tapping some of the same emotional issues that helped <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> capture the White House in 1968 and 1972 and laid the groundwork for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s twin landslides of the 1980s. Some experts say it is a serious mistake for the Democrats, who have lost four of the past five presidential elections, to underestimate the seriousness with which the electorate responds to emotional appeals to its patriotism or fear of crime. The gut issues, symbolic or not, are real issues for many voters. `` Politics is a matter of gut responses, otherwise known as emotions,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of government. `` It's not just media manipulation,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> associate professor of government and expert on media and politics. `` If the Democrats continue to believe that symbolic issues do n't matter, they're going to foul up time and time again.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said symbolic issues loom larger in this election because `` American politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The candidates seemed quite deliberately to choose not to face up to the pragmatic issues.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the race unfolded during a time of economic prosperity when there were few differences between Democrats and Republicans on dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` When you subtract the issues of peace and prosperity, you leave very little, so we are left to fight on those gut isues of symbolic issues,'' he said. Conservative analyst <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, publisher of the American Political Report, said, `` The Republicans have replayed the key cultural and patriotic issues with the swing voters that got the Republican presidential majority started in 1968 and 1972 and 1980.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign flogged the crime spree of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lifer who escaped while on a weekend furlough from prison, and pummeled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being a self-proclaimed, card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. In doing so, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s people succeeded in rekindling in the minds of wavering <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats the emotions that `` pulled them to vote for Republican presidents in earlier years,'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to develop rival issues to appeal to the same swing voters. In their final debate last Thursday, both candidates sounded apologetic about the low-road campaigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, recalling the almost non-stop attacks the Democrats unleashed against him at their July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard -LRB- but -RRB- he started it.'' `` It was both ways,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Two months ago, the best issue that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ` wimp' and the best issue <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was ` L-word' -LRB- liberal -RRB-.'' The Republicans `` went after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on all the L-word stuff, which they had some nice symbols for _ prison furloughs and <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegiance </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and stuff like that. But it was n't about those issues,'' said <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` The reason they played was because they resonated in terms of 20 years of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> history as too liberal,'' he said. `` It's not a small issue. It is haunting this party. It is which direction the plurality party in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants to take the country.'' On the other hand, the Democrats' wimp charge quickly lost its punch as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerged from the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as `` Captain Marvel,'' said <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said, `` By going hard-line on the cultural and patriotic issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drove down the wimp factor. ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put on a bit of a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> outfit.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s highest negative rating in polls remains the perception that he is too close to the wealthy and too far from the middle class. But <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to `` come on hard and tough and use economic populism and nationalism to get the guys in the bar in the ethnic sections of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> or your dirt farmer in rural <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> angry at the Republicans.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, `` In a time of real prosperity, questions of economic justice and hostility toward big business do not cut it with the American public.'' As for such emotional issues as flag and country, `` you ca n't pretend that something that is an issue is not an issue,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said `` It hurts the Democrats when they try to dismiss this in some way as bigotry or tasteless or un-American.'' `` It is an issue to Americans whether you wear your flag on your sleeve or whether you wear it on the seat of your pants,'' he said. `` Republicans are not only willing to wear their flag on their sleeves, they're willing to wear it on their foreheads. The Democrats are willing to move it off their keester, but they still want to keep it half covered, and Americans do n't like that.''

<HEAD>NRA Slamming Dukakis in Radio Ads He Says Are `Outrageous

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is saturating more than a dozen states with radio commercials slamming <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on crime and guns as `` up-North nonsense'' that should n't spread beyond his native <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, says the advertisements are an `` outrageous distortion'' of his positions. His campaign has asked the gun lobby to pull them, and is counter-attacking with its own radio and TV ads. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, general counsel for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, told the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> by letter that it was wrongly attributing statements to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and ignoring an issues questionnaire the governor had filled out, according to campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s lobbying arm, said the ads were factual. He accused the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign of `` a heavy-handed attempt to keep us from relaying the truth.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> started running the radio spots a week ago in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, among other states. `` We're covering those states from one end to the other _ probably thousands of stations,'' said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>. He declined to say how much the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> had spent on the radio ads or on a companion direct-mail campaign. La <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> said `` there is tremendous support for gun ownership and hunting'' in the target states. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strident position as governor ... could very well cost him those states. He's making a last-ditch, desperate attempt to say he's really pro-sportsmen and pro-firearms ownership,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to defuse the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> ads last weekend before they began, calling them `` another outrageous distortion of what I believe.'' His campaign is counter-attacking with its own radio ads and, in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with two television ads on the crime and gun control records of Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, operating independently of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, is running three 60-second radio spots. One quotes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as saying he was `` going to do everything I can to disarm this state.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> narrator says, `` Do n't let this up-North nonsense go nationwide.'' Another NRA spot features actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, who says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` opposed mandatory jail time for drug pushers, vetoed the death penalty for cop killers, gave murderers weekend vacations from prison. He also did everything he could to take guns away from honest citizens. ... <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not just challenging your rights. He's taking on the Constitution.'' Another ad is aimed at Pennsylvanians. A `` sportsman'' says he loves the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> woods and accuses <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of raiding his state's conservation fund to pay off state debt. `` Protect our outdoor heritage. Defeat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' an announcer concludes. In his letter, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denied ever saying he was going to try to disarm his state. He also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had completed a questionnaire for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> in which he said he supported firearm ownership for personal protection, hunting, competitive shooting, informal sport shooting and collecting. `` He did support a ban on ` Saturday night specials','' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. One of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> TV spots running in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> says only one candidate for president has voted for federal gun control _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The ad cites a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vote as a congressman and adds, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen. Do n't be confused.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> TV ad says `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat by while a federal furlough program released thousands of prisoners, many of them drug dealers _ almost 14,000 in 1987 alone. And now suddenly <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is attacking <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for just one case in his furlough program. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took action and changed that program, in his state he's reduced crime by 13 percent and the murder rate is the lowest of any major industrial state.''

<HEAD>Congress Aims To Finish Campaign-Year Bills; Leave Town</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, running behind schedule, is trying to finish work this week on election-year bills dealing with drugs and taxes so members can return home to campaign. Some legislators were so itchy to leave town that on Friday they sported buttons reading, `` Free the 100th.'' `` I certainly would hope we would n't have to stay beyond Wednesday. But nobody can predict that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> originally aimed to quit Sept. 30, but bogged down in a fight over the The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finally passed its $ 2.6 billion version on Friday. The bill calls for the death penalty for drug traffickers who murder, funnels more money to treatment programs and creates a new, Cabinet-level drug `` czar'' to coordinate the federal government's anti-drug effort `` This has taken more time than we expected, but it was very complicated and a lot of issues had to be considered,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., one of the chief authors of the anti-drug package The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its drug bill Sept. 22. Senators hope <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members will accept some version of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation rather than appointing a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. `` If we have a conference, we'll be here until Thanksgiving,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION> `` We wrote our bill with an eye toward language the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> might accept.'' Election-year demands from voters to do something about drugs have driven the bill, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. `` People want us to respond, they want leadership from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Also unfinished is a compromise tax bill, but <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiations broke off in disagreement Friday, imperiling chances of reaching a plan both chambers can accept. The measure includes a package of corrections to the landmark 1986 tax law, some new tax cuts along with other tax increases to offset the reductions, and a taxpayer `` bill of rights'' for persons facing <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enforcement actions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan raises taxes between $ 7 billion and $ 7.5 billion over the next three years, compared to the price tag of just under $ 3 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> package. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators proposed a compromise $ 3 billion package, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> responded Friday with a $ 4.5 billion counter, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side turned that plan down, and the talks stalled. `` We have not selected the pallbearers yet,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team He said the two sides would try to talk again Monday. Also pending on the legislative agenda are a variety of other bills, including one that would elevate the Veterans Administration to Cabinet-level status. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved that bill Oct. 6. Supporters of the legislation say upgrading the agency's status will give the nation's 27 million veterans direct access to the White House. It would be the government's 14th Cabinet department. When the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meets Tuesday, one of its first votes will be on a bill requiring full disclosure of credit card information to consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which returns to work on Monday, passed the bill last week. The proposal requires banks, department stores and other firms which offer credit cards to tell consumers about annual fees, interest rates, late fees and other information. Only a few states now have laws requiring public disclosure of such information before consumers receive the cards. Another piece of unfinished business is legislation providing the first-ever restrictions on lobbying by former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a plan that is part of a general tightening of federal rules against influence peddling by top government officials. Differing versions of the legislation have passed each chamber and the discrepancies must be worked out before it can win final approval.

 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials engaged in quiet discussions last week about a man who, although unseen by the outside world for nine years, is at the heart of a diplomatic debate over one of the world's most unfortunate countries. He is <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, whose 3 -LCB- - year rule in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during the late 1970's led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million of his countrymen before he and his <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> allies were driven out by Vietnamese invaders <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON>, an authority on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> is believed to be operating out of a small town in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> border, plotting a return to power once the Vietnamese carry out their stated intention to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1990. Hawk has written on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based human rights group, and formerly worked for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been using diplomatic pressure to encourage the Vietnamese to fulfill their promise to withdraw but is trying to find a way to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from retaking power once that happens. This issue is a major concern of pro-western countries in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and was discussed this past week during a visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by former Cambodian head of state Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The dilemma facing the administration is that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, with help from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is by far the strongest of the three rebel groups fighting the Vietnamese occupation forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is providing non-lethal equipment to the other two groups _ one led by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the second by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that his solution is the formation of a national reconciliation government after the Vietnamese forces leave. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` moderates'' would be allowed a role, while <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and other top leaders would be sent into exile, possibly <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, insist they recognize their past excesses and have now become `` liberal capitalists.'' <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> actions at the refugee camps they run along the Thai-Cambodian border suggest little has changed since their 1975-78 period in power. `` All evidence points to the fact they are the same as they were,'' Hawk says. `` If you look at treatment of civilians under their control in resistance base areas in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, their basic pattern of rule by terror and denial of human rights is still present.'' Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., said in a speech last month that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and, to a lesser degree, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, bear responsibility for the continued existence of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> as an effective fighting force `` Ten years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> were all but dead,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. `` But because of questionable regional strategies and the self-imposed silence of the American government, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> beast was nursed back to health by Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and now the resolution strategy for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has to deal with the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are poised to return to their old ways of torturing and terrorizing the people of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sees <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as a strategic issue. Worried about encirclement by pro-Soviet countries, including <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s highest priority is to hasten <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from that country by assisting the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> The degree to which the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> engaged in terror was outlined in a book written by a survivor of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule. Writing under her adopted name in `` The Stones Cry Out,'' <PERSON> Molyda </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymusiak </PERSON> recalled the inhumanity of that era: `` It has rained over the past few days, and the ground is so soft that corpses not buried deep enough are rising up out of the earth ... I start praying as I walk along.'' In an article in a 1987 issue of Commentary Magazine, <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puddington </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official as saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> atrocities `` were the most serious committed in the world since Naziism.'' <PERSON> Puddington </PERSON> wrote that one of the most important objectives of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> training was to infuse young cadres with `` a callousness toward violence, pain and killing. `` A key technique was the torture game. Animals, including domestic animals like dogs and monkeys, were systematically dismembered or burned by children-soldiers.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> himself, who was under house arrest in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> era, once recorded his own reaction after witnessing these activities. `` The screams of the poor beasts were heart rending,'' he wrote. `` The sights and sounds of them were unbearable. But the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> youths could n't get enough of it.''

 For <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, playing <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> did n't just mean looking or sounding like the great jazzman. It meant making sure everything fit. `` I was nervous. I was scared,'' admitted <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who stars in `` Bird,'' <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed film biography of the late jazz saxophonist. `` I was going into areas I had n't really dealt with. It was a most challenging role. As a person, I felt really honored to bring the character to life. It was so fortunate that it happened.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who died in 1955 when he was just 34, moved into musical areas that few touched. With such musicians as <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, he revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, helping create the style called be-bop. A brilliant and troubled man, he was no less overwhelming as a person. `` I think he embraced life,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` He took whatever pleasure he could find in it. He was n't afraid to do that. It held a lot of bad consequences for him, but he did that and that's where he hurt himself.'' Where <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> primarily hurt himself was by a heroin addiction that plagued him for much of his life. `` He was trapped and he started very young,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` I think it has to do with his particular way of life. He was very sensitive about a lot of things. I think he knew it was destroying him. He did n't want other people using it.'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, awarded this year's prize for best actor at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, gives a performance that should get Academy notice. He was born in <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and originally studied opera. But he became interested in acting and began appearing in local equity productions. His involvement with movies came later. `` I was probably going to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and work on stage and that was it,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It just so happens I was working on a play and it turned into an opportunity to do a film.'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> at pool in `` The Color of Money,'' and played <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' protege in `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' He has been directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>. `` They all have a very keen sense of focus, although their focuses are different. Some go out in a circle and encompass everything. Some just focus on this little tiny thing.'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> had not even met <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> when he was given the part. `` I did n't know he had any interest in jazz whatsoever. I did n't have any preconceived ideas about him I never expected to see Dirty <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> walk into that meeting. He turned out to be a real jazz aficionado and really easy to work for.'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> is something of a rarity in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, a successful black actor. He had always been aware of the difficulties in getting good parts, but was not deterred from going into films. `` I'm fortunate because I never wanted to do film. I'm real fortunate that I never really thought about it. That fear was n't there because there was n't a great need at first,'' he said `` A lot of the roles I've played have not been written for black actors.'' As part of his research for `` Bird,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> talked to those who knew <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, including the jazzman's wife, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>. He discovered that no one really `` knew'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` It seemed they did n't know what was going on with him. That helped me immensely to understand where he was coming from,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` What did he really say to them? What did they really know about his fears, how he felt about this? When they told me what they knew, it was more important what they did n't know. Someone would say he had no fear and that would tell me how much they knew.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was true to the spirit of his music, spontaneous and emotional, given to extreme highs and lows. Understandably, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> was drained by the effort to sustain those feelings. `` There are scenes in the latter part of his life when he's closer to death, when he's lost almost everything He's walking around like a lost soul, the only thing that's moving him around is a little pilot light,'' the actor said. `` That was difficult to understand, trying to find that place where you're still alive but you have nothing left.'' But how well could anyone really understand <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>? `` Bird has disentegrated into pure sound,'' a musician once said. Was Parker beyond words? `` He was pushing towards sound,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` The sound was totally coming from emotion. More than words can express. I think that was something he felt, understood and put in his music.'' But <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> believes he shares an important philosophical goal with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` I think he had a quest for understanding, openness. I believe I have that, trying to figure that stuff out, being open to all kinds of different things.

 Thieves who stole eight snakes from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> zoo picked the most valuable snakes and the easiest to handle, authorities said. The snakes, worth about $ 8,000, were reported missing Saturday morning. Workers found no sign of forced entry at the Bird and Reptile Building and lids still covered the snakes' cages, some of which were found latched, suggesting the snakes did not escape. `` The thing is it's just these specific snakes that were taken,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Furber </PERSON>, zoo spokeswoman. `` We figure that somebody knew what they were doing and just went after some of the most valuable snakes in that section.'' Gone were three ringed pythons, three carpet pythons and two endangered Dumeril's ground boas. <PERSON> Ardell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, animal care manager for the zoo's reptile department, said the snakes probably were taken for resale to underground pet traders or collectors. `` These little snakes that were taken may bite, but it would n't hurt at all So they took the easy ones to handle,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The stolen snakes were between 2 and 3 feet long. The loss of the boas, which were brother and sister, especially worried zoo officials, Ms. <PERSON> Furber </PERSON> said. The snakes came from <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and are listed as an endangered species because their forest habitat is being destroyed. `` They're pretty valuable animals,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` I'd hate for them to go off and sit in someone's garage somewhere.''

<HEAD>Congress Moves To Tighten Up Safety At Nuclear Weapons Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, disturbed by evidence the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors, has passed a law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those applied to reactors used to produce electricity. Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation is needed in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s acknowledgement that its aging reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed radioactivity into the environment. `` The main difficulty is that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has been its own policeman,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, one of the authors of a bill passed in September creating the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to monitor the operation of weapons reactors. The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has the authority to inspect the facilities at which the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> manufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon. It will make recommendations to the secretary of energy, the president and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but it will not have the power to close down facilities which are operating unsafely. In the past, the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent has overridden concern over the environmental hazards posed by weapons reactors. Finding a means to balance those concerns will be expensive. The cost of building a new generation of safer nuclear weapons reactors is between $ 3.2 billion and $ 6.8 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say. And it is expected to cost more than $ 110 billion to clean up contamination from the reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> and other facilities near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` We quantified that as best we could, the tens of tens and tens and tens of million dollars that this government, this department, has to address in the future if it would in fact meet what we believe is a moral obligation to rectify past sins,'' Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> and other department officials say they are delaying until early next year the reopening of the first of three reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, where they manufacture nuclear weapons materials for the Pentagon. And they announced the appointment of an extra layer of managers at the site to draft safer operating procedures for the start-up. By the end of next year, they said, all three reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> should be in operation. Meantime, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>, chairman of the E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said the government has exaggerated the problems with the nuclear facility. `` The plant is not in disarray,'' <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` These facilities are safe, will work and will produce and meet the nation's requirements. The operators are well qualified and well trained.'' <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility since 1950, has opted to let its contract lapse. The plant will be taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on April 1. <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> claimed the government wants to criticize the plant so that <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> will look good in comparison when it begins operations next year. Pentagon officials say national security could be endangered by a prolonged delay in manufacturing one of the materials, tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which boosts the power and efficiency of nuclear weapons. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are warning, however, that they want prior assurances about safety procedures before production resumes at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. And some lawmakers may demand the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> boost expenditures to clean up past contamination. One idea circulating on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is to require that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reactors be monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Safety, an adjunct to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which licenses civilian atomic plants. A panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> also recommended, in a report released in March 1987, that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operate under standards as strict as those of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. But even some of the staunchest advocates of nuclear safety say that may not be the best immediate solution. Although the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has years of experience with reactors used by utilities, it has little with reactors used in making nuclear weapons materials, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> chairman who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s independent <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said it could take four or five years to draw up a set of requirements for weapons reactors that would be as detailed those developed for civilian reactors. `` However, some of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> criteria can be applied,'' he said. `` The first criteria is that the plant should be constructed and operated in such a way as it does not release radioactivity. Production goals should not be the first criteria.'' Until those standards are worked out in more detail, and until the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is appointed and hires its authorized 100 employees, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they will oversee the safety of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reactors. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Environment, Energy and Natural Resources, have vowed to key a close eye on efforts to restart the facility.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s no-holds-barred campaign on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was partly inspired by the lessons of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s loss in the 1960 election, says one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s closest aides. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said that `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and I spoke several months ago, and I asked him to give his historical perspective _ what -LRB- President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did and did n't do for him.'' It is n't known how much 1988 campaign strategy figured late last summer when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to the White House for dinner. But history shows that <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did little to help his vice president, which embittered <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who narrowly lost the 1960 election to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. After remaining steadfastly neutral in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries this year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has steadily increased his role as Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s celebrity surrogate in the campaign against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has left no doubt in anyone's mind _ as <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did _ on his feelings about his vice president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name in official statements whenever he can. Last Friday, for instance, he sought to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some credit for the successful flight of the space shuttle Discovery and for enactment of legislation intended to lessen American reliance on gasoline as a motor vehicle fuel. The president has worked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name into ceremonial bill signings that otherwise were bipartisan events, such as the recent signing of a fair housing bill which congressional Democratic sponsors attended. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has hit the road to campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among so-called Reagan Democrats, conservative-minded Democrats in key states who helped elect the president in 1980 and 1984. `` I think it's fair to say that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has campaigned for his vice president in an unprecedented manner,'' <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` I think the president's thriving. He's enjoying himself. He thinks he's making a difference.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is enjoying his campaign role `` at a time when people said he was a lame duck and had no authority.'' It remains to be seen how much <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aggressive campaigning will benefit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president has n't always demonstrated an ability to transfer his personal popularity to others. He was unable to prevent the Democrats from seizing control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, even though he campaigned vigorously for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates that year. `` If <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> goes out and says, ` This guy is a bad guy and this guy is a good guy,' is that going to move those people? Who knows?'' said Republican consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>. Yet, campaign aides say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speeches amount to a powerful `` reinforcing mechanism'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign messages. This happened recently when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went into ethnic strongholds of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to urge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election a couple of days after the vice president had campaigned there. In the past three weeks, the president has visited <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and he'll take his peace-and-prosperity pitch into <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in the coming week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s standard stump speech argues that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will safeguard conservative gains of the past eight years against a threat from liberal Democrats to raise taxes and weaken the national defense. Republican strategists initially envisioned using <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mostly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the Sun Belt and, of course, in his home state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strengthen solidified in those regions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concentrated instead on other, more closely fought swing states in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Northeast. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s value to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has soared as troublesome issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair and ethics questions centering on former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> faded into the background as time passed. `` They have had a marvelous campaign in which they have integrated the message themes very well,'' said Democratic consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said it is `` just right'' to redirect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearances where they might count the most. `` You're sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles,'' he said. `` There's no surrogate bigger than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 A flood has severely damaged one of the world's greatest ancient cities, and the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> government has appealed for help in repairing the ruins of the once-glorious Roman metropolis. A torrent of water rushed over <LOCATION> Leptis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, about 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, in November after several days of heavy rains sent water over a dam three miles from the ancient trading center on the Mediterranean coast. For three days, the rampaging river carried tons of dirt and uprooted vegetation through the ruins, leaving mud yards deep in such remarkable areas as the Roman Emperor <PERSON> Hadrian </PERSON>'s baths and one of two forums. Most heavily damaged was the <LOCATION> Colonnaded </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a 400-yard-long road on which visitors strolled from the bath complex to the ancient port. Much of the stone carriageway, lined with more than 200 marble columns with lotus designs, broke under the weight of the floodwaters. The port end of the street disappeared and is now covered by a small river. Near the heart of the ancient city, the waters reduced the path to a jumble of stone blocks and columns fashioned from Egyptian granite and Italian marble. Only the ancient market, theater and forum were spared the wrath of the flood. <PERSON> Sandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Stucchi </PERSON>, an Italian archaeologist who surveyed the site, estimated restoration would cost $ 33 million and take 10 years. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almahgiub </PERSON>, superintendent of the archeological district that includes <ORGANIZATION> Leptis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> government is hoping to restore the site with help from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. `` We want to make an appeal to all people who love monuments,'' said <PERSON> Almahgiub </PERSON>, looking at the weeds sprouting from several inches of sun-baked dirt covering the base of the basilica's pulpit. <PERSON> Almahgiub </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Leptis </LOCATION> and whose father was a caretaker of the site, said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> would provide the personnel to do the manual work but does n't have the technical expertise. <PERSON> Bekaddour </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouldali </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the organization has asked <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ which colonized <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> until World War II _ to provide funds for a archaeological supervisor, preferably <PERSON> Stucchi </PERSON>, and has provided earth-removal equipment and a pump in case a flood strikes again An Italian Foreign Ministry official, <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Incisa </PERSON>, says his government is willing to help but is waiting for a more detailed report from <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>. Little is known outside <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> about the disaster because <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s magnificent archaeological inheritance is not easily seen Tourism per se does n't exist in the state ruled by Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. A recent summer Tuesday brought only about a dozen visitors to <ORGANIZATION> Leptis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, almost all of them foreign diplomatic, construction or oil employees. In addition, lovers of archaeology must step delicately in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, whose regime frequently rails against foreign imperialism. For the more militant <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> supporters, reminders of ancient colonialism like <ORGANIZATION> Leptis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> are unwanted souvenirs to be destroyed. Italians began excavating the sprawling city about 1912, the same year the Rome-based government of dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> occupied <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> controlled until the arrival of the Allied forces in 1943. The flood halted dreams for extensive excavation of the harbor, considered one of the best preserved in the ancient Roman world and expected to yield many relics from Leptis' beginnings as a key Phoenician port and later a prosperous Roman city. <PERSON> Leptis </PERSON> was founded by seafaring Phoenicians from <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> as a trading post in the first millennium B.C. As merchants developed a brisk business in ivory, ebony, slaves, gold and precious stones from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the site was established as a colony of <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> about the 7th or 6th century B.C. In 101 B.C., <PERSON> Leptis </PERSON> became an ally of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and its residents gained full rights of citizenship. The city prospered during the reign of Emperor <PERSON> Septimius </PERSON> <PERSON> Severus </PERSON>, who was born here in A.D. 193 and whose arch of triumph greets visitors. With the decline of the Roman empire, <PERSON> Leptis </PERSON> eventually succumbed to the raids of Germanic tribes that maintained a kingdom in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the 5th century, then to Byzantine rule in the 4th century and finally to an Arab invasion in 642. Its name may derive from a Phoenician combination `` li'' and `` bada,'' meaning town at the edge of the desert. `` Magna'' _ meaning great in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> _ has been added to distinguish the town from another <LOCATION> Leptis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s rich collection of archaeological sites include prehistoric cave paintings in the south, the ruins of a Greek site called <LOCATION> Sabratha </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, and various relics from the series of conquerors.

<TEXT>
 Here he's called `` <PERSON> Mikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Maus </PERSON>,'' and the 60-year-old American has surprisingly good rapport with Soviet youngsters for an international film star making his first live appearance in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Sunday evening at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 2,500-seat Rossiya Theater, with a police cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside, the first Soviet festival of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> animated classics opened with a showing of `` Fantasia'' and a visit by <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> himself. Standing about 5 foot, 6 inches in his clunky black patent leather shoes, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> <PERSON> Spieth </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s West German office, strolled waving down the theater aisle to the strains of `` <PERSON> Heigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, It's Off to Work We Go.'' In a juvenile version of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> superpower summit, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> was given a big hug and a keg of honey by <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> the Bear, mascot of the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Olympics. The lights dimmed, and the Rossiya's screen filled with the image of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> in the 1941 short subject `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s Crime,'' in which he purloins the contents of a piggy bank to finance a nightclub outing with <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON>, then suffers pangs of conscience. In a Russian-language voiceover, minus the squawking tones in which <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> usually speaks in English, French and other Western languages, the duck concluded: `` Crime does not pay.'' There was delighted laughter and applause from the audience, which included <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> and many other Soviet VIPs and their families. As well as `` Fantasia,'' which was first released in 1940, the Disney animated films `` Snow White and the Seven Drawfs,'' `` Bambi'' and `` 101 Dalmatians'' will be shown to children and their parents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> is accompanied by a contingent of executives from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> here to investigate the business possibilities created by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and social reforms, which have also loosened controls on the media and the movies. `` ` Fantasia' is almost 50 years overdue in coming to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> company and nephew of its founder, pioneer animator <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, told the audience. `` Through the universal language of animation ... I feel we are taking one more step toward bringing our countries together,'' he said. Disney and other company executives played down the business end of their trip, but the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said they were talking with the Soviets about cooperation in making and distributing films and in jointly building a `` Wonderland,'' a Disneyland-style theme park already planned for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is virgin territory for the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> company and its enormous stocks of cartoons, feature films and television shows. Characters like <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, Chip and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> and other Disney creations that are childhood companions of hundreds of millions in the West mean nothing to many Soviets. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> is; I have never seen him,'' said <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON>, 3 -LCB-, who was brought to the Rossiya by his mother, <PERSON> Varya </PERSON>, only because she had seen Disney cartoons on videocassettes and at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> movie theater that specializes in cartoons. Although <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> and their friends may not have instant name recognition in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> yet, their faces adorn T-shirts, badges, children's clothing and hundreds of other items made by cooperatives or sold on the black market. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s creators do not get a single kopeck in royalties for such exposure. According to <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, the first Disney cartoons were shown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> film festival in 1935. The cartoons, which included `` The Three Little Pigs'' won an award. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organ that commonly devotes its news columns to weighty matters like the national grain harvest, said, `` Disney is a remarkable master and a genius second to none. `` Who does not know, for example, his hero, a little mouse named <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> who really became the first ` star' of the world screen, or his inseparable friends _ the shy cow <PERSON> Clarabella </PERSON> with the langorous eyes, a hot-tempered but handsome little duck, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>; a muddle-headed dog named Goofy, or a careful doggy named Pluto?''

<HEAD>Trial Starts For Two Accused In Government Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two men charged in a government corruption scheme were described by prosecutors as greedy crooks, but defense lawyers say they are humanitarians who helped bring 20th century progress to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>, 70, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>, 55, are charged with bribery, extortion and other crimes stemming from their involvement with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION>, the Eskimo-led government for the vast northern region of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. They are accused of scheming to influence the awarding of contracts during the borough's $ 1.2 billion public works construction effort during the administration of borough Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> from 1981 to 1984. The project included schools, health clinics, airports, utilities and streets in the borough's seven villages <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> worked as a lobbyist for the North Slope Borough, while <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> worked as a public works consultant to <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>. `` This is a case about fraud, bribery, kickbacks, extortion and corruption,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaan </PERSON> as <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>'s trial opened Friday before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. Testimony is expected to begin Monday. Dischner and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> used their influence to defraud the borough of $ 21 million, <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said, and they were able to do it through <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, the young and inexperienced mayor they helped elect. `` This influence was based on friendship and trust and was cemented by bribery,'' <PERSON> Spaan </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, said the case was brought `` because the prosecution misunderstands the situation on the North Slope.'' The government is confused about the law, he said, and the duties that <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON> had as lobbyist and adviser to <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> and his public works program. `` This is a case about a man, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dischner </PERSON>, with a strong sense of values, a strong sense of what is right, being unfairly prosecuted for his strong commitment to his dream.'' That dream, said <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, was that the Inupiat Eskimos of the North Slope deserved the same basic standard of living and opportunity to work enjoyed by the rest of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Life on the North Slope was as savage as those of us would imagine it would be. The weather was cruel there,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Finegold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> helped bring dramatic, if expensive changes, his attorney said. `` I'm not saying the permafrost is flowing with milk and honey as a result of the work of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, but it is more livable now.'' <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> and other officials were also indicted as a result of a federal investigation into the public works program. <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, two of his administrators and two engineeers have pleaded guilty to various charges in a plea-bargain arrangement and will testify for the prosecution. Dischner and <PERSON> Mathisen </PERSON> are accused of bribing <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> and other borough officials with boats, cash, clothing and a $ 45,000 diamond ring; demanding kickbacks totaling $ 9 million from six contractors doing business in the borough; taking an additional $ 9 million through companies they themselves controlled; and extorting additional money from other contractors.

<TEXT>
 Fourteen of the 23 members of the ruling Politburo could be removed at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting this week, a Politburo member said Sunday. The party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gathers on Monday for what is billed as a historic session that may include the most sweeping personnel changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since it came to power after World War II. Four members of the Politburo have announced their intention to resign at Monday's meeting. They include two former heads of the party, <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON>; Franc Setinc, a leading Communist from liberal northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kolj </PERSON> <PERSON> Siroka </PERSON>, a senior ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> from the troubled province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Politburo member <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupurkovski </PERSON> told reporters that 10 other Politburo members also may be replaced. The other nine members are party chiefs from each of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two provinces and a representative of the armed forces. They can be voted out of office only by the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION>, provincial and armed forces party organizations that elected them to the ruling body. They include Serbian Communist party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, whose push for greater Serbian control of its two provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has stirred up the current political crisis. Most political observers expect at least some Serbs from the Slav minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to rally in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> outside the modern conference center where the Communist party starts meeting at 9 a.m. on Monday and is expected to last at least two days. The changes to be made are in response to widespread calls from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and workers angered by government austerity measures for the resignation of top party leaders they see as inefficent and corrupt. The criticism has touched even national party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who clashed last week with <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and touched off a wave of requests from <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party organizations for his resignation. In the past two years, 16 Politburo members and 44 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have come under fire in public, <PERSON> Tuporkovski </PERSON> said. Of the 165 members that comprise the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, one has died and two have resigned since the body was last elected by the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, leaving 162 members at present.

 Five black men were killed in a series of attacks, including four in violence-plagued townships outside <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, police said Sunday. Two men were killed and 11 men and women suffered burn injuries when attackers threw gas bombs at a home in the <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> township near the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, police said. In the same township, police found the body of a man who had been stabbed to death. Police also found a man who had been fatally stabbed in the nearby township of <LOCATION> Hammersdale </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the main township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, a man was shot dead, police said. All the attacks were listed in the police report, which describes incidents the previous 24 hours, but the report provided no additional details. The townships outside <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> have been the site of the worst black-on-black faction fighting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in recent years. At least 600 people have been killed in black-on-black fighting the last two years, according to most estimates.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday he's ready to `` hit the ground running'' as president and to designate a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> swiftly, but that he wo n't be lulled into regarding an election victory as inevitable. `` There was speculation that I was dead three months ago,'' the Republican presidential nominee told reporters, trying to discount recent polls showing him with a widening lead over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He vowed to wage a spirited battle against the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor in key states right up to Election Day on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scoffed at reports suggesting he had already decided on most of his prospective Cabinet. `` I am not going to do something that dumb and shift gears,'' he said. `` And yet, should I win, it would be a matter of urgent priority. I'd want to be ready to move early on the priorities that I've established.'' He said `` there is not one scintilla of overconfidence'' that he has all but won the election. At his first news conference in more than two weeks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his election should drive interest rates down, claimed that the Iran-Contra affair was behind him, and took aim at a familiar target _ <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's an elite inside the elite there. And everyone knows who I'm talking about,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Campaigning Saturday in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't wnat somebody from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> telling me what I can do and what I ca n't do. Asked about that statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking `` How can I, a nice guy from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, feel that way about <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>? Now come on.'' `` I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in -LRB- recent -RRB- Democratic administrations that come out of the same liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the past has accused his rival of having a `` Harvard Yard boutique'' mentality. While spending the day in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> visiting with his son, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, and his family, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also attended a professional football game between the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION>. He planned to spend most of this week campaigning in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from last Thursday's presidential debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In his meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once again declined to say where he would make spending cuts to bring down the federal deficit under his `` flexible freeze'' plan to balance the budget by 1992. Although he has spelled out areas where he would spend more money, including education, child care and cleaning up the environment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would list corresponding spending cuts only if elected president. His proposal calls for overall federal spending to be limited to the rate of inflation, with specific cuts offsetting each new spending item. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that, for his scheme to work, interest rates would have to decline by several percentage points from current levels. `` A lot of the interest rates are psychological,'' he said. `` I believe they will come down.'' He suggested that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency would send a calming message to world financial markets, largely because they would see he had a deficit-reduction plan that would work, and that in turn would ease interest rates. Spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, was asked why markets would respond more favorably to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget plan than they had to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's past deficit-reduction plans. `` Because he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- means it, he means what he says,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that, though he did not want to be premature, he already has named a team headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> to study the transition to a possible <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. `` He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You have to hit the ground running.'' `` There are no names ... or lists against these slots on the management wiring diagram. I just can not get diverted into thinking about that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He added: `` We're going to keep on with our original game plan, keep working hard, keep traveling to key states. We're going to keep moving forward. ... All I know is to just drive right down to the wire.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asserted that the Iran-Contra affair was `` behind me'' as an election issue, because most Americans believe his insistence that he had no advance knowledge of the arms-for-hostages deals. The vice president said that, if elected, he would put running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of coordinating drug enforcement and other important assignments to show world leaders that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` full confidence in the vice president.''

 Soldiers erected roadblocks throughout the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Sunday to prevent dozens of Jewish settlers from choking major roads to protest Palestinian violence.

Hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> policemen from the territories resigned last March after they were accused by fellow Arabs of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. The incident Saturday night took place in <LOCATION> Jaljoulya </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> village bordering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army blocked settlers from protesting on two main <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> highways against increased Palestinian attacks on Jewish targets, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The action came a day after an Israeli man was stabbed and wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. Hundreds of soldiers mobilized at dawn and turned back dozens of cars driven by the Jewish militants on roads linking the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, military sources said. Near the Ariel settlement outside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a group of settlers fired their guns into the air and smashed the windows of several Arab vehicles before troops arrived at the scene and turned them away, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. The army had no reports of shootings and said the troops kept roads open throughout the morning, permitting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> laborers to travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. About 65,000 settlers and 1.5 million Palestinians live in the territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Since the revolt against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8, 299 Palestinians have been killed. Six Israelis have died in unrest-related incidents during the same period. In political developments Sunday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he would be willing to give up the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in exchange for peace if his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wins the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. Speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also repeated his willingness to give up some territory in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said he would immediately call for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference if he is named prime minister. `` We do not want to dominate one-and-a-half million Palestinians against their will,'' he said, referring to the population of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` We must let them run their own lives.'' Asked specifically about <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s Plans for the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, he replied: `` We have in mind to evacuate the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip within an overall arrangement. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> will be demilitarized.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he favored returning to the year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with a <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation through an international conference. He said he still believed he could bring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> into negotiations despite the king's statement this summer that he was breaking his ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> held from 1948 until 1967. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' opponent Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes an international peace conference and wants a settlement in line with the 1978 Camp David accords, which would offer limited autonomy to the Palestinians with their future to be worked out later.

 Democrats found inspiration Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>' win in the first game of the World Series, saying that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can still pull off a come-from-behind victory over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the remaining three weeks of the presidential campaign. `` I think we're going to be like the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> last night,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` It looked like they were down and out, and all of a sudden they hit a home run and won it. I think we can do that in the next 24 days.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, alert to that possibility, said that despite polls that show him widening his lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` we're going to keep on with our original game plan, keep working hard, keep traveling to key states ... keep moving forward.'' `` All I know is to just drive down to the wire,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that he is entering the last leg of the long campaign as an underdog, but advised Republicans not to pop champagne corks too early because `` we're going to be the ones celebrating on election night.'' He said he will continue fighting for the values he believes in. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as vice president, `` sat on the sidelines for eight years while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> got beaten in world markets, while they mortgaged our children's future to a mountain of debt, and a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was being sold off every day at bargain basement prices.'' The World Series analogy was used by several Democrats. `` It's an extremely close race,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> ` s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>. `` You're going to see <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> come on like <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> in the bottom of the ninth inning last night in that game with two outs ... he could barely walk around the base path, but he knocked a home run to win the game,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>, 5-4, in that first game of the Series. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that he already has a team studying the transition to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency and that he is ready to name his Cabinet quickly. Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> heads the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team. `` He has drawn up wiring diragrams, what we should do if we win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You have to hit the ground running.'' The vice president, however, scoffed at suggestions that he already had decided on most of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members he would choose. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' said the Democratic ticket has been the target of character assassination by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We were subjected to what I think was the most demagogic attack that I've ever seen at the presidential level,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` To talk about, question the patriotism of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is outrageous ... but that's what they did, and that's wrong and we must not let them win on that kind of basis.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp was trying to put the best face on what many perceived as a clear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory in last Thursday's debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program that `` there's a lot of time left in this race, there's a lot of volatility in the electorate, and I find it amazing that all of these people are writing this race off.'' But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, a Republican strategist, said that `` over the last three months, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made the sale; he has convinced the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public that he has the strength and the ability to lead this country.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>: `` It's just a question now of getting the voters to the polls on Election Day.'' According to a published report, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to concentrate in the three weeks left before the Nov. 8 election on 18 states with 272 electoral votes _ two more than needed for election _ to pound home basic economic themes and to make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign style an issue itself. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign vehemently denied the account by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in Sunday's editions. `` We are not writing off whole regions of the country,'' said campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. `` We're very, very competitive in a large numbers of states.'' Communications director <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said he thought the use of 18 states by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was misleading and said the newspaper's grouping of states does not represent where the campaign will concentrate its resources Those 18 states, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region; <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. In those states, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> managers believe the Democratic nominee is either favored or competitive with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Their list gives priority attention to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where they believe the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is trailing but competitive. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, will concentrate on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, regarded as close. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up editorial support Sunday from the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times, which said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running on a platform which `` would perpetuate too much injustice, and the deeds and examples of his campaign have been anything but inspirational.'' The newspaper, which recommends candidates rather than endorsing them, also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose a man. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose a boy,'' the newspaper said. `` Either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has delusions of immortality or he simply does not care into whose incompetent hands his untimely death or disability would deliver the nation. Neither explanation speaks well of his own fitness for the presidency.'' In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, a random telephone survey for the Sunday <ORGANIZATION> Rutland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barre-Montpelier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> indicated a 43 percent to 42 percent lead for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The random telephone survey of 502 registered voters had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said Sunday that it will complete its planned withdrawal of 50,000 military personnel from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on schedule in December. That would leave about 50,000 Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will remove all of its military forces from the neighboring country by 1990. The beginning of the formal withdrawal was conducted at a ceremony in June when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced the withdrawal of its military command and some 13,000 soldiers. It said other army units left <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in July, August and September. A joint communique issued Sunday by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government said: `` The remaining units will be withdrawn monthly from now to the end of 1988, and the last contingent of the 50,000 volunteers to be withdrawn in 1988 will be repatriated by land and water during the month of December.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, ousted the radical communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime and installed another communist government. Communist forces defeated U.S.-backed governments in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the spring of 1975. The joint communique, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed representatives of foreign countries, international agencies and news organizations to observe the final stage of the first half of the withdrawal plan. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is expected to pass again this year, for the 10th consecutive year, a resoludion demanding the pullout of all Vientmaese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. But a new element in the draft of this year's resolution calls for `` effective international supervision and control'' of the withdrawal. More than 1 million Cambodians were killed during the harsh rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and there is widespread fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will regain power if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls all of its forces out of the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> began a guerrilla campaign after it was ousted in 1978 and has the strongest military force in a coalition of groups fighting the Vietnamese and Cambodian grovernment troops.

<TEXT>
 An earthquake struck western <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> Sunday afternoon and government officials said at least 25 people were injured as buildings collapsed and landslides ripped down the mountain slopes. The Environment Ministry advised people not to return to hundreds of damaged buildings. State television said about 30 tremors of lesser magnitude rumbled through the same region throughout the afternoon. `` As far as we know a total of 25 people were slightly injured by the quake,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said. `` The state apparatus is on full alert and all the necessary material, such as tents and drugs, have been sent to the area.'' The quake measured 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. It said the initial quake occurred at 2:34 p.m. and the center was 150 miles west of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in the Ionian sea between <LOCATION> Killini </LOCATION> and the resort island of <LOCATION> Zakinthos </LOCATION>. `` People panicked tremendously and rushed out into the streets as soon as it happened, `` said <PERSON> Aleka </PERSON> <PERSON> Markoyiannaki </PERSON>, a local government official. `` In some villages almost half of the buildings collapsed,'' she said. `` It was really very disastrous and the damage is very extensive.'' Almost 80 percent of the villages of <LOCATION> Bartholomou </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kastro </LOCATION> were destroyed, police in <LOCATION> Killini </LOCATION> reported. `` Streets are filled with rubble and plaster and there's lots of broken glass from shattered shop windows everywhere,'' said a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police on <PERSON> Zakinthos </PERSON> said the quake caused landslides in the island's hills. Western <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has been hit by several quakes during the past month, and two days ago one registering 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale rattled the same region. A devastating earthquake struck the Ionian islands in 1953, killing 400 people and destroying thousands of homes. After that most buildings on the islands were contructed to resist tremors of up to 7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on seismographs. Each increase by one number means a tenfold increase in ground motion. A quake registering 6 can cause severe demage while one recorded at 7 is consdered a major quake capable of widespread heavy damage.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> returned to his boyhood home Sunday to dedicate a regional cancer center in honor of his parents. About 750 people attended the ceremony outside the <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s $ 650,000 gift last year pushed the hospital's fund drive over its $ 1.3 million goal, hospital officials said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he felt an obligation to respond to the fund drive, especially in the face of hard economic times that have hit <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> communities. `` If you're lucky enough in this life to accumulate enough funds to live better than you have any right to, then you have a moral obligation to pay back to the community or to the country or to the place that brought you up,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` I'm honored to be from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> family lived in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> from 1933 to 1947. The comedian said his parents would be very proud to have the center named for them. Utility executive H.L. `` Kit'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> died in 1964, and his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, died in 1985. `` My dad would probably say, ` Ooooh boy, <PERSON> John </PERSON>,' and my mother would say ` Do you think that really looks like me?''' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, referring to a bronze likeness of his parents unveiled. The 3,000-square-foot center houses a radiation therapy linear accelerator for the treatment of cancer. Hospital officials say the center will be able to treat about 300 patients yearly.

Rain showers were scattered from the northern Rockies west through the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> as a cold front settled across the region. The front was associated with a developing low pressure system that was moving southeast across central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Winds gusted to 62 mph with blowing dust around Cody, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and high winds were also reported in the northern <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> panhandle.

<TEXT>
 An expected purge of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership will at best be only a start in trying to ease <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s worst crisis since World War II. The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets Monday to argue and approve what are billed as the most sweeping personnel changes in more than four decades in power. A Politburo member said Sunday that 14 of the 23 members of the ruling Politburo may be removed at the meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Four have announced their intention to resign and Politburo member <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupurkovski </PERSON> told reporters 10 others may be replaced. However radical the changes are at Monday's meeting, they will be only a stage in what one best-selling writer and dissident called the `` long agony'' of breaking with founding father <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> dominated <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> for 35 years, ruling supreme until he died in May 1980. His portrait still hangs in almost every public room in the country and is carried fondly by some of the Serbian nationalists who have staged mass rallies throughout southern and eastern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in recent months. Their devotion to <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> is in some ways ironic, since they hope to restructure the ineffective political system <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> bequeathed his nation. Their demand for greater Serbian control over the Serbian republic's two autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> prompted the current political crisis. Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has skillfully exploited the mass rallies. He has achieved national prominence on the wave of indignation Serbs feel about the alleged harassment of their fellow <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavs </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the ancient Serbian kingdom that is now dominated by ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who are mainly Moslem. In exploiting the rallies, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has broken the order laid down by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who gave broad autonomy to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two provinces and annually rotated national offices among them to prevent one region from dominating the others. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s drive has alarmed non-Serbian Communist leaders who fear the nation's largest ethnic group wants greater control over <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> affairs. Yet they can not ignore his popularity in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and the broader appeal of his calls for changes in the aging and sometimes ineffective ruling elite. On television and in newspaper columns last week, leaders engaged in an unprecedented public dispute over which leaders from which region will stand or fall when the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> replaces up to one-third of its 165 members at Monday's meeting. `` In these circumstances, it is easier to teach a whale to play the tambourine than to carry out the personnel changes,'' commented the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION>. The ethnic arguments are only part of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s problem. Unwise borrowing in the 1970s and the lack of a strong federal government to manage the economy have led to economic crisis, with the foreign debt at $ 21 billion and annual inflation at 217 percent. Living standards have fallen by one-half since 1980, and austerity measures adopted in May have slashed salaries while prices continue to rise. Striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing numbers, prompting the alarmed government to seek permission from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to relax the austerity program. The ethnic and economic arguments sometimes obscure the growing calls to abandon one-party rule and state-run economic management. The corruption in each Yugoslav republic angers the impoverished workers, and the verbose and tangled Communist jargon that surrounds most political pronouncements annoys even Communists themselves. After watching members of the national party Politburo and the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> leadership debate for seven hours in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, on Tuesday, the party leadership of the Serbian town of <LOCATION> Titovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzice </LOCATION> commented, `` if the debate at Monday's meeting is dominated by the tenor of the one in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> ... then it had better be canceled.'' This frustration indicates the pressure for change in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. But writer <PERSON> Dobrica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON>, a wartime hero and former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> purged by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> in 1968, predicts that rearranging its political system will be a `` long agony.'' `` For decades, we have lived in a false situation,'' <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON> said in an interview. `` False standards, a false economy, a false unity, a false freedom. ... At some moment, the potentials of that fiction are exhausted, and that moment is approaching.''

<HEAD>Soviets Publish Picture Of AIDS Victim, Asks Finns To Do Same</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> newspaper printed the photo of a local prostitute that it said was the first Soviet citizen to die of AIDS, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Sunday. The news agency reported Soviet authorities also wanted the picture to be printed in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> newspapers because it claimed the woman's last customers were Finns. There was no immediate response from Finish authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> identified the victim as <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayevskaya </PERSON>, 29, and said she died Sept. 5 in the <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refresher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. It said the cause of death was confirmed as AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The woman's picture was printed Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Leningradskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> newspaper with a warning to any Leningraders who had had sex with her that she was carrying AIDS. It urged those people to report immediately to the city's AIDS testing center, which the report said is open 24 hours a day to administer anonymous tests. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the photograph was published `` on the demands of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Leningradskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- readers and following heated debate among medics, lawyers and the police that it should be reprinted by newspapers in neighboring <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>.'' `` It is Finnish tourists who have been of late the most frequent clients of the prostitute,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said Ms. <PERSON> Gayevskaya </PERSON> sought medical help, complaining of persistent colds and a weight loss of 26 -LCB- pounds, and she was hospitalized in August with pneumonia. Soviet authorities once maintained AIDS was an exclusively Western problem, linked to the moral decline of capitalist countries. But in the last two years, health officials have said the disease is a serious threat although they say the number of cases is far lower than in the West. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Aza </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakhmanova </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s chief specialist on infectious diseases, reported tests on tens of thousands of people showed 24 <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> residents, including nine Soviet citizens, were carrying the AIDS virus. `` What is particularly deplorable is that one of them is a 6-year-old girl who contracted the disease from her mother,'' the agency said. AIDS is an incurable disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers It is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a tap of his hand, Mexican matador <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> symbolically killed an 842-pound bull, drawing a chorus of `` ole'' at a bloodless bullfight Sunday. His sword had a Velcro tip and the bull's horns had been clipped to eliminate any possibility of bloodshed from man or beast. But the bullfight still prompted efforts by city officials and animal rights activists to halt what they claim is an inhumane activity. Outside the International Amphitheatre, about 30 members of Trans-species Unlimited, an animal rights group, marched with picket signs to protest the bullfight, the second in six weeks, as a mariachi band hired by the organizers entertained arriving spectators. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, director of the group's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter, said `` bloodless bullfighting'' is banned in 43 states, and should be prohibited in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Bloodless bullfights are staged in parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and annually in <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` It's just another form of animal abuse and exploitation ... and we are trying to prevent it,'' she said. `` We have nothing against Latino culture. This is not a racial or a cultural issue, but an ethical issue.'' <PERSON> Homero </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Meda </ORGANIZATION>, a Hispanic self-help organization that co-sponsored the exhibition, defended bullfighting as an important part of Hispanic culture dating back to the Middle Ages. `` Why do n't they stop the rodeo, or the circus, or the pigs fighting with a man at the State Fair in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>,'' which are crueler to animals, said <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> said the organizers spent about $ 150,000 to stage the event, including legal fees and the cost of bringing in six professional matadors from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and six California-bred bulls. Any profits will be used to buy food and Christmas toys for poor Mexican families in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he said. The bulls were to be slaughtered to provide meat for <ORGANIZATION> Meda </ORGANIZATION>'s food bank program. <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> said his group would like to sponsor six to eight mock bullfights a year in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and similar shows in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other states with large Hispanic populations. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>, executive director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, said he was determined to make this the last bullfight in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` In <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> they eat dogs, in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> they fight cocks ... do we want to do this in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>?'' asked <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>. `` There's a long list of animal exploitation among different cultures ... and we do n't want to expand it.'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said he was pleased only about 200 people turned up at the 9,000-seat amphitheatre for the first of two bullfight shows Sunday. The city's first bloodless bullfights were held on Sept. 3 at an outdoor arena over <LOCATION> Poholik </LOCATION>'s objections and drew about 1,100 people. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> granted permission to stage the fights, ruling that the confrontations were no more cruel than rodeos, which the city allows, and that the city's animal cruelty law is vague <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said city attorneys were drawing up a proposed city ordinance banning the bullfights.

<HEAD>Three Escaped Prisoners Holding Family Hostage Die In Shootout</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto SEL-1</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three escaped prisoners holding a family hostage died and a fourth was captured Sunday in a dramatic shootout. One prisoner remained at large climaxing a week-long manhunt involving tens of thousands of police. The five prisoners were among 12 who opened handcuffs with a makeshift key during their transfer in a prison bus Oct. 8 and fled with a loaded pistol. Seven prisoners have been recaptured or surrendered. Saturday night, four fugitives armed with the pistol and knives raided the home of <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-soo </PERSON>, a 50-year-old office worker, in northwestern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and held <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>'s wife, four daughters and a son hostage. Ko returned home early Sunday, but said he escaped and called police after the drunken guards fell asleep. More than 500 armed policemen immediately sealed off the house and anti-terror units huddled under the walls. During their confrontation with police, the prisoners fired several shots, threatening the lives of hostages. They ignored appeals from their relatives to surrender, but released <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>'s wife and 11-year-old son. Shortly after noon Sunday, there were several minutes of screams and gunfire, and police rushed into the house. One prisoner was dragged out and another, bleeding from his neck and body, was taken out on a stretcher. Police said the other two prisoners were found dead, without elaborating, but news reports said they killed themselves. Police said the injured prisoner, <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kang-hun </PERSON>, died about three hours after he was taken to the hospital. Police said <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> cut his neck with broken windows, when officers broke in and opened fire. Police said all hostages were rescused unhurt. The prisoners had raided at least six homes, held families hostage for food, sleeping and bathing, and dissappeared with extorted money and valuables. Their continued flight and sporadic appearance across <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> had frightened many <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> residents, although they did not hurt anyone held. The escapees, each sentenced to seven years or more for murder, rape or robbery, often told hostages they had escaped because their sentences were too harsh. On Friday, four escapees invaded a western home to evade an extensive manhunt when one colleague was caught. Police launched a house-to-house search, but the four managed to flee shortly before police arrived.

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday began a three-day visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where he is to discuss an East German offer to pay reparations to Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> arrived in a private jet and was greeted by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Nier </PERSON> at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schoenefeld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Later at his hotel room, he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he believed the East German leadership was sincere in offering reparations but he could not provide details. `` Judging from the reception at the airport and the schedule that has been put forth I'm optimistic,'' he said. `` Of course there has to be some earnest money. But I have said the money is a token thing. What is at stake here is moral culpability.'' `` I am the first World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` I think this is good for <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communist authorities said in June the government was willing to provide `` humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust but they gave few details and there have been negotiations on the amount and methods of payment. Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is considering paying up to $ 100 million. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> signed an agreement in 1952 with the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to compensate Holocaust victims and their relatives and since then has provided about $ 48 billion. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> is to meet Monday with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. An agreement for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to pay reparations would mark a major change by the government. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has argued it bears no reponsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities because the nation was not founded until 1949 when the victorious World War II Allies acknowledged the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into East and West. It also has taken the stand that both communists and Jews were victims of the Nazis. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>'s arrival was the top item in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news media. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency also carried a lengthy article about the opening of an exhibit devoted to the history of Jews in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their persecution by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Decade-Old Tax Revolt Will Be Tested in November</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Voters in half a dozen states face an eclectic mix of tax measures Nov. 8, from a steep hike in cigarette taxes to tax cuts reminiscent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s decade-old Proposition 13. But there are signs the anti-tax fever that gripped the nation after Californians enacted Proposition 13 in June 1978 has cooled as inflation has eased, the economy has improved and taxpayers no longer feel so squeezed. Only in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> will voters decide issues this November that would force deep cuts in taxes. `` Voters are protecting what exists, but not going further. And in some cases, it looks like the electorate is willing to approve, more so than in the'70s or early'80s, very specific taxes for specific purposes,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, editor of the Free Congress Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly newsletter published in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Californians, for example, will consider a measure to raise cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack, using proceeds to promote health. The tax revolt peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when voters passed tax-limiting measures in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 21 state legislatures enacted taxing or spending limits, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Some key tax issues facing voters this November: _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>: Dakota Proposition II would roll back property taxes on agricultural property to 1 percent of 1984 values, and 2.5 percent on non-agricultural property in stages by 1991 It would limit increases in property valuations to 2 percent a year. Local governments could impose special taxes if two-thirds of the voters approve. Supporters argue the state overrelies on property taxes and never lived up to promises to reform taxes after a similar ballot proposal was rejected in 1980. Opponents, including Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, cite a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> study that warns that local governments stand to lose from $ 18 million to $ 112 million a year, and that schools would be hardest hit. _ <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>: Having survived legal challenges, Amendment 6, the so-called Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment, will appear on Nov. 8 ballots It would require voters to decide all future tax increases except in emergencies, would cut the income tax by about 10 percent and would limit residential property taxes to 1 percent of market value. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said the measure would be `` like throwing a bomb'' at state government. He and other political and business leaders who oppose the issue say it would cut state revenues by $ 65 million in the first year and $ 130 million the second. _ <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>: Voters face three tax initiatives that together would reduce state and local revenues by $ 329 million One would limit property taxes, a second would roll back 1987 tax hikes on income, sales, gasoline and cigarettes, and a third would give tax credits for private education. A poll this month forecast an uphill battle for the initiatives, which are opposed by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, his Democratic challenger <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, and a wide range of agriculture, education and wildlife groups. _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: A tobacco industry-led coalition has spent $ 10 million to defeat Proposition 99, which would boost cigarette taxes for the first time since 1967, from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack Opponents call it an unfair tax that would trigger a wave of cigarette smuggling. The measure, which could raise $ 600 million a year, would finance anti-smoking programs in schools, medical care for the uninsured and tobacco-related medical research. It is backed by a variety of medical and health care groups as well as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>: The `` Fair Tax Amendment'' backed by Gov <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> would make it easier for the Legislature to enact personal income tax increases. Income tax increases currently require a 75 percent majority vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>; the amendment would lower that to 60 percent. The state has had an income tax since 1929 but it has been raised only once in history, in 1971. Anti-tax activists have filed a lawsuit challenging the amendment, and representatives of some business groups oppose the idea of making income tax increases easier. But <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said that if the amendment passes, the state `` will still be one of the hardest states in the country to raise a tax in.'' _ <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>: Question 9 on the ballot seeks to impose a constitutional ban on personal income taxes, even though the state does not have one The gaming industry is backing the measure on the theory that if new taxes ever became necessary, the measure would force the Legislature to look for other ways to spread the tax burden through corporate income taxes as well as existing property, sales and gaming-related taxes. They argue existing state taxes place too big a burden on the gambling industry while other forms of industry have relatively light tax loads.

 Cuban authorities have broken up a black market ring that operated out of a major <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> food store, a government news report said Sunday.

 The leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main Christian militia has tightened his grip on power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave with the aid of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and reportedly <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well. But <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> faces trouble with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which blames him for a political crisis that threatens to formally partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and scuttle <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s hopes of controlling its unruly neighbor. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is also alarmed at political and military support for the Christians from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its archrival in the Arab world, after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, a 38-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, sabotaged parliamentary efforts to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> before his six-year term expired Sept. 23. He opposed Damascus-backed Christian candidates who he said would turn <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into a `` Syrian satellite'' if elected. Under an unwritten law since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> became independent from the French in 1943, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president has been a Christian. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s heavily armed Lebanese Forces militia, with about 6,000 hard-core fighters and 30,000 reservists, this month took over <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s 3,500-man militia and his news outlets and confined him to his east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, a former medical student, was left as the undisputed leader of the Christian enclave, home to about 800,000 Christians. Moslems make up about 55 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s population. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers have reported the Israelis, who occupy a border strip in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, sent <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> a shipload of weapons through <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s militia-controlled port last month. There has been no independent confirmation, but the Israelis have aided <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> in the past. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, who coordinates Israeli policy on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not involved in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> outside the border buffer zone, but stressed it has `` an immediate and fundamental interest in what happens -LRB- in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB-. ... <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a partner in the game.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> enraged <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> by recognizing the Christian government of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named as caretaker prime minister, rather than the rival Moslem cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Both cabinets now claim they are <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s legitimate government until a new president is elected. Informed Arab sources said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has shipped the Christians ammunition, rocket launchers and U.S.-made armored personnel carriers captured from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Some have been seen in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, who has gained supremacy in bloody showdowns with his rivals over the last three years, has survived a dozen assassination attempts as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sought to impose its will on the Christians. Lebanese Moslem and leftist officials who visited <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said he raged when <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> usurped <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Tishrin, the Syrian government daily, accused the `` Geagea group'' of `` preventing <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from achieving a constitutional presidential election ... and seeking the partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' It warned that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` will not allow any partition situation to be imposed.'' But after a 13-year civil war, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a state in name only. The Syrians, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, want to impose a settlement through the election of a Christian ally who would reduce the Christians' traditional privileges and give the majority Moslems an equal share of political power. But <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> and other right-wing Christians, who have seen their people driven out of the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains and the coastal plain south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into the shrunken 390-square-mile enclave, reject any surrender of political power. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> favors a federal arrangement with the Moslems, who with the Syrians control about 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He has forged an alliance of expediency with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, another Maronite. But how long that will last is questionable. The two men long have distrusted each other, and their forces have skirmished repeatedly over the last three years. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, believes that some understanding must be reached with the Syrians, if only to get them out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has an estimated 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, mostly in Moslem areas.

<HEAD>Protestant Extremists Claim Responsibility for Killing Two</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist group said Sunday its gunmen killed a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> because he betrayed the association's cause in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> said its members killed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> at east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Castle Inn pub on Saturday. Four other people were wounded as the killers sprayed the crowded room with gunfire. In a statement to the news media, the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, 47, was the target and claimed the other victims were shot when <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> tried to attack one of the gunmen. Initially it was suspected that guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> carried out the attack. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has been been fighting for years to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the mainly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Protestant extremists formed organizations to battle the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is not illegal but the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> is. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1971 as an umbrella organization for Protestant vigilante groups and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news reports have said the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> is the association's military branch. Some east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> residents suggested that <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s killing involved racketeering. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the ruling council of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last year ordered an investigation into <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s activities. It said he had been accused of skimming money from the estimated $ 5.2 million raised annually through rackets operated by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists. In 1985 <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and two other men appeared in the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Magistrates' Court to face 33 charges related to extortion from contractors. Witnesses who testified wore hoods to avoid reprisals. The case was dropped before going to trial.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, marking the 10th anniversary of his papacy, beatified three 19th century priests Sunday and called for `` authentic sovereignty'' for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during a meeting with pilgrims. About 50,000 well-wishers carrying candles jammed St. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s Square Sunday evening to take part in a prayer vigil and celebrate the anniversary The pope leaned out the window of his private studio and blessed them. `` Ten years ago the church of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> received through divine providence the bishop that now thanks you, the man who came from afar,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in Italian. `` He saluted you the first time with these words: Praised be <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. I do that again this evening, and I salute, with you, the entire world.'' In the afternoon, he told 5,000 cheering Polish <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> officials and pilgrims at a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> auditorium that `` the independence of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not be measured by geopolitical criteria, but only with the criteria of authentic sovereignty for the nation.'' His remarks, in Polish, were reported by the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. The three who were made blesseds of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> included the Rev. <PERSON> Venceslao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozminiski </PERSON>, a Polish priest who founded 20 religious orders and associations; and two priests, the Rev. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestrelli </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Houben </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kozminski </PERSON>, born Oct. 16, 1829, in <LOCATION> Biala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Podlaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, founded an order of nuns in 1855, three years after he became a priest. He founded a monastic order three years later and before he died had began 20 different religious congregations or orders. <PERSON> Silvestrelli </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1831, headed the <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> -LRB- Holy Staircase -RRB- passion congregations for 25 years and under his direction the monastic order grew from six to 12 congregations. <PERSON> Houben </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Munstergeleen </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1821, was sent to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where he spent much of his time as a missionary to coal miners. Beatification in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is a step toward possible sainthood. The ceremony Sunday took on added interest because it came on the anniversary of the day 10 years ago when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> became the surprise choice of the conclave to succeed Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, who died after just 33 days on the throne of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded Sunday night as an armored car of the paramilitary civil guard passed by, killing one guard and injuring seven, police reported. They blamed Basque separatists for the attack and two other bombings that killed one person and injured three. Police said the car bomb contained up to 66 pounds of explosives and as many pounds of shrapnel. It exploded near the provincial jail in this northern city. The blast destroyed or damaged 15 parked cars and shattered windows in six apartment buildings. The slain guard was identified as <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, 31, the driver of the armored car. Earlier Sunday a bomb exploded outside a tunnel near the railroad station of <LOCATION> Lepazpia </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, killing <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, 26, a member of the autonomous Basque police, and injuring three other people, according to police. They said a second bomb exploded inside the tunnel but caused no casulties. No group claimed responsibility but police suspected guerrillas of the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, a Basque language acronym for Homeland and Liberty. The deaths brought to 13 the number of victims blamed on ETA this year. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has asserted responsibility for more than 600 killings, with most of the victims police and military officers, since it took up arms in 1986 to gain independence for the three-province Basque region in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 A fourth person has been charged with murder in the beating death of an 8-year-old girl at a house run by a religious center founded to train and discipline inner-city youngsters, authorities said Sunday. The 59 children found since Friday in the rural house where the girl was allegedly beaten to death were in state custody, said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branch manager of the state Children Services Division. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was charged Saturday with murder. He was initially taken into custody Friday on a charge of hindering prosecution, according to <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> Three other staff members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also face murder charges in the death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>. Her father, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is founder of the association and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Officials said several adults from the center brought the dead child to a fire station in a rural area 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> early Friday. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was beaten on her head, chest and extremities and died of `` multiple blunt-force injuries,'' said state Medical Examiner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewman </PERSON>. Investigators found 53 children crowded into the four-bedroom farmhouse on Friday, some with scars that might indicate physical abuse, said sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Detloff </PERSON>. All are reportedly from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said at a news conference Sunday that six other children ranging in age from 1 -LCB- months to 12 years were removed from the home Sunday. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the children placed in care of the state `` seem to be in good health.'' `` Based on everything we know right now, we'll recommend continued custody'' at a preliminary hearing Monday afternoon in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said. `` We've had little contact with the parents,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We've not heard from very many of them.'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was interviewed Sunday by sheriff's investigators. He declined to appear at the news conference. In an interview with KATU-TV of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> accused the news media of slanting stories about Ecclesia. `` Now, murder's involved,'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> said. `` And I accuse you on national television of murder in the first degree.'' `` Now my little girl is dead,'' he said. `` And that our whole group has been pressured into all manner of activities we would not have had to do had we been understood a little better.'' <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, said Friday night from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that the group sometimes uses `` physical correction'' as a form of discipline, but denied the punishment was cruel. Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp at the same site to train children for the Olympics. But it was not clear if the children found here last week were engaged in a similar training program. The children, ranging from 3 months to 16 years of age, were hungry but otherwise healthy, according to officials who admitted them to state juvenile facilities over the weekend. They spent Saturday talking with pediatricians, playing with donated teddy bears and enjoying peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, authorities said. `` The kids are starting to open up and have become fairly animated,'' he said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, acting director of client services for the state Children's Services Division. `` They were quite hungry when they arrived. It seems that they only had a tomato apiece on Friday.'' The other three persons charged with murder are <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipporah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28, both of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. All four suspects were in custody Sunday at the county jail. Two other adults connected with <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s group were charged with hindering prosecution and jailed in lieu of $ 100,000 bail each. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, was a star basketball player at <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in the 1970s. He founded the controversial athletic association in 1975. The organization brought an estimated 70 to 100 men, women and children from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to the Sandy area in April 1987. They returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in June 1987 after neighbors opposed Ecclesia's applications for zoning permits to allow 55 children and 45 adults to live in tents and use portable toilets and showers.

<TEXT>
 Five nuns remained locked inside the infirmary of their monastery Sunday to protest changes in their way of life, and no progress was reported toward a solution to the dispute. `` The television and radio reporters are all outside waiting around but basically everything's at a standstill today,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a lay worker at the Roman Catholic Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. She has acted as a liaison between the nuns and the media. `` Nobody is speaking today,'' she said Sunday. `` We think it will be quiet until tomorrow.'' The changes made at the monastery include the introduction of sweets, radio and television. The five barricaded nuns think the 13 nuns at the monastery should strictly adhere to the traditional Carmelite life, which stresses prayer and silence. The nuns locked themselves in the monastery's infirmary on Oct. 4. They say they acted out of fear that the Diocese of <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> would evict them. They have said they will not give up their vigil until their case is considered by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which under canon law is the official arbitrator in intra-order disputes. On Saturday, the Rev. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Culligan </PERSON>, a Carmelite friar from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, met with the sisters but was rebuffed when he could not prove through documents that he was the designated representative of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> the nuns say they want. His official position gives him authority over Carmelite friars but no direct power over nuns of the order. Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>, head of the diocese, has said the nuns could be relieved of their vows for their actions.

 Hundreds of rioting students burned furniture and clashed with police in a second night of homecoming weekend violence that resulted in 50 arrests by officers clad in riot gear, police said Sunday. At least six people, including a police officer and a person found in a trash carrier, were treated at a hospital for minor injuries suffered Saturday night and early Sunday, said hospital nursing supervisor <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. As many as 1,500 people, including many St. <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, were involved in the rioting in a four-block area on Friday and Saturday nights, Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said. Students set off firecrackers and some played the Beatles' song `` Revolution'' on a stereo as police swept through the crowd, estimated at about 700 people Saturday night. Other people tore down street signs and jumped on cars, or threw beer bottles and pieces of lumber. About 60 officers, including some from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and neighboring counties, shot tear gas to disperse the crowd and made 46 arrests, most on misdemeanor charges of unlawful conduct or criminal damage to property, <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said. After a lull of a few hours, 150 officers were sent in early Sunday to break up crowds of 150 to 200 people, some of whom had set fire to furniture and a trash carrier that had been dragged into the street, <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION> said. `` It's like a battle between the police and the students,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, the managing editor of the student newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, who watched the disturbance from her dormitory room. The riots broke out in the midst of homecoming celebrations by the school's 16,400 students. Witnesses said the problems began when officers tried to break up loud parties and fights. `` The catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people with a lot of booze in them,'' <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said. `` They're not experienced enough with alcohol and they just go kind of crazy.'' <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said that in his 31 years on the police force, the weekend's violence could be topped only by demonstrations against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Student <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> said officers backed off several times Saturday night to avoid a potentially disastrous confrontation. `` It was mob mentality,'' he said. Many people had been drinking heavily and were enjoying the havoc, he said. `` A lot of kids thought they were being cool and funny. The students were acting stupid.'' Some of the handful of people arrested Friday night probably will be charged with felony assault for throwing beer bottles, and the arrests Sunday morning will result in several more misdemeanor charges, <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said. Thirty-four of the 50 people arrested were university students. University President <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said he would appoint a task force to investigate the violence and met with school officials to discuss the situation further.

 About 100 demonstrators gathered outside a jail Sunday to protest what they said was the refusal of the city to let a jailed Roman Catholic priest celebrate Mass. The Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weslin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was one of more than 300 people arrested Oct. 4 at three <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> abortion clinics on the first day of a week of anti-abortion protests. Sunday's demonstration was in the form of an ecumenical church service led by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> ministers. The ministers, some of whom were jailed during the demonstrations or a similar series of sit-ins and protests last summer, said the alleged refusal was a serious breach of freedom of religion. <PERSON> Weslin </PERSON> is one of the about nine protesters who remain in jail, mostly because of refusal to sign a bail bond or to give their true identities. <PERSON> Weslin </PERSON> said in a statement read to the group that he has been in solitary confinement since he tried to celebrate Mass for prisoners Oct. 11. He denied a city claim that he was forcing the Mass on people and blocking passageways. He also rejected a city argument that he is free to leave jail at any time. `` I can not, in good conscience, pay a bail bond for attempting to save a child's life. If I am released on my own recognizance, I will leave here,'' said <PERSON> Weslin </PERSON>, who said he is on a fast of coffee and water. More than 1,200 people have been arrested since the protests began July 19 at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> abortion clinics. The protests have been organized by the New York-based Operation Rescue. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, police arrested 45 people who blocked entrances to an abortion clinic Saturday. `` We do n't want to telegraph our punches, but we want people to know this is n't a fleeting fad,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Devault </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and one of the coordinators of Saturday's demonstration All those arrested outside the clinic were charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine up to $ 1,000.

Participants at a convention workshop on Saturday said law enforcement officials need to cooperate with community leaders and educators in the fight against gangs. `` It's the short-term efforts, like -LRB- gang -RRB- sweeps, that get a lot of attention,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, deputy police chief in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` But it's the active role of communities that can help. `` There -LRB- have -RRB- to be a good number of changes in the schools and in adult education,'' he said. `` The responsibility has to be spread to all areas.'' Parks said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police had on file names of some 26,000 gang members, more than double the number in the 1970s. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> said, his city is unwilling to shoulder the blame for the spread of gang violence. `` Many communities that experience the gang problem find it all too convenient to blame it on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said Parks. `` There is a lot of mimicking by kids in different places. It does n't necessarily mean they come from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Unseasonably heavy rain in the Cascade mountains flooded rivers throughout western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, chasing about 45 people from homes and a campground on Sunday. Rain was tapering off late Sunday, but more was predicted Monday night and early Tuesday with the approach of another storm system, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers fed and arranged shelter for 30 people evacuated from trailers in the <LOCATION> Snoqualmie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campground </LOCATION> in the Cascade foothills, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. Some of the campground occupants lost everything they had with them, <ORGANIZATION> KOMO-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported. About 15 people apparently were staying with relatives after being evacuated by boat Sunday morning from houses in <LOCATION> Sultan </LOCATION>, a town of about 1,500 residents in forest land 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a dispatch supervisor for the <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office. Floodwaters from the <LOCATION> Skykomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> closed five roads in the area, she said. The Snoqualmie, Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers also reached flood stage at upper elevations Sunday, the weather service reported. A flood warning for the <LOCATION> Nooksack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was canceled late Sunday. Heavy rain washed enough logging debris down the <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to cause a partial dam to form at a <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern railroad bridge, but no major problems were anticipated, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheahan </PERSON>, management director of the <ORGANIZATION> Skagit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Several logging roads were temporarily washed out and <LOCATION> Hanson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> flooded, but damage was minimal and no evacuations were required, he added. Several roads were closed in the Cascade foothills east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> because of flooding around <LOCATION> Snoqualmie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogershok </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. Some sandbagging was done in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> area, nearly 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but no evacuations were required there, she said. Floods usually follow warm rains on a late fall or winter snowpack, but heavy rain over the weekend in the <LOCATION> Cascades </LOCATION> was enough by itself to send rivers over their banks, she said. During the 48 hours up to 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service reported 1.64 inches of rain in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, 1.39 in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION> and 1.04 at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. More than 6 inches of rain fell at <LOCATION> Stampede </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Snoqualmie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> and about 50 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Planes brought food supplies to starving refugees Sunday, but a relief official said it would take at least two weeks to reduce deaths and help emaciated people so weak they ca n't protect the corpses of loved ones from scavenging hyenas. Another relief official said the $ 1 million, 10-day airlift to the war-ravaged south, which began Thursday, came too late to save thousands of younger children. Twin-engine Cessnas are carrying 90 tons of food to about 40,000 southerners facing starvation in <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>, 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. They are hoping to provide stopgap relief for those who left behind their crops and cattle to escape a civil war in the region. A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks before the impact of the U.S.-financed supply mission could be felt. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight to 10 people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment and a long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.

 A year after Wall Street's crash, Americans widely view the stock market as a risky investment, and fully a third see a good chance it will plummet again soon, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Although respondents doubted the market's stability, 75 percent said the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, had little or no effect on their lives, and only about one in 10 said their finances had worsened in the past year. But the crash did have one apparent impact: Of the 1,125 adults in the national telephone survey, more than six in 10 said they were being more cautious with their money now than they were a year ago.

 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union remained locked in labor talks past a Sunday strike deadline as 17,500 blue-collar workers in five states awaited word from the bargaining table. No strike was called as both sides tried to find common ground and avoid a walkout. `` There has been a little bit of movement, and that small movement is enough to warrant continuing the talks,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the site of the talks in a <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hotel near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` We're going to remain flexible to see if that leads us in the direction we want to go. Negotiations are continuing. We ca n't predict how long it's going to go,'' he added <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON> described the talks as an `` hour-by-hour situation'' and said the labor contract was not extended past the 9:30 a.m. Sunday deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said he had nothing to add to <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON>'s statement. The contract between Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> originally was scheduled to expire at midnight Sept. 30. But the two sides agreed to extend talks indefinitely pending the outcome of talks between the union and <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> settled without a work stoppage when the two sides agreed to a three-year contract that included a 3 percent pay increase, boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security It was the first general pay raise for <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> workers since 1981, and the union hoped to use the <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> contract as a pattern for its Caterpillar talks. Caterpillar workers were poised to strike factories and warehouses at 12 cities in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Negotiations started Aug. 4 between the union and <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment with 58,800 employees in several countries. Union representatives had asked the company for merit pay, 100 percent job security, a reduction in overtime and the recall of 1,000 laid off <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members. They also sought an early retirement program and an increase in pension benefits for those on early retirement. The union reportedly was seeking a three-year pact and a 3 percent wage increase in each year of the contract. In past talks <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> officials have sought more flexibility in job assignments and scheduling, as well as a simplified grievance procedure and new guidelines for overtime. The average factory worker at <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> earns $ 14.61 an hour, or $ 30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With fringe benefits, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> calculates its current labor costs at $ 26 an hour per employee. In 1986, negotiations between the two sides were extended four times before a settlement was reached.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on the verge of emerging from six years of bankruptcy court protection, on Sunday reported its net income increased 9 percent in the third quarter as sales of the company's fiber glass and forest products rose For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said net income totaled $ 53.5 million, or $ 1.96 a share, up from $ 48.6 million, or $ 1.76 a share a year ago. Net sales during the period rose 7 percent to $ 584.3 million, from $ 547.9 million in the 1987 third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> noted the positive performance `` was achieved despite the continued competitiveness in most construction related markets.'' Sales of the company's fiber glass and forest products rose 7 percent in the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1982 while being deluged with asbestos injury and property-damage lawsuits. By 1986, property damage claims alone had come to a staggering $ 85 billion, or about 40 times the company's total assets. The company also faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in the billions of dollars. Earlier this month the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the last challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan, virtually assuring the company's emergence from protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The plan calls for establishing certain trusts to settle claims of asbestos health victims. `` With our strong operating performance and solid balance sheet, we're ready to exit Chapter 11 and move forward,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. For the first nine months, net earnings were $ 122.3 million, or $ 4.31 a share, down 8 percent from $ 132.6 million, or $ 4.73 a share. The current period includes certain charges and costs associated with the restructuring. Excluding the effects of the restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said net earnings would have totaled $ 136.2 million for the first nine months, compared with $ 120.1 million in the year-ago period. Net sales during the first nine months totaled $ 1.65 billion, up 7 percent from $ 1.54 billion in the year-ago period.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Refrigerators, irons, washing machines and a host of other electric appliances have vanished from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stores partly because production has stagnated amid rising demand, a Soviet newspaper reported Sunday. The article in Trud, the labor daily, was the latest in a series of recent exposes on what the Soviets call `` deficits'' _ the disappearance of goods from stores. Muscovites are now coping with deficits on hard-to-find products ranging from razor blades to detergent. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said improving the array of goods and services available to Soviet consumers is necessary to show that his economic reform plan has taken root, but problems with both quality and quantity are still rife. The Trud report said that in some cases, Soviets are now buying 10 irons at a time when they appear on the market out of fear of future shortages. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korobkov </PERSON>, the head of a research institute on consumer demand, told the paper that rumors of a pending price rise linked to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms had triggered a buying boom. `` People have rushed to buy vacuum cleaners and refrigerators in reserve before they rise in price,''' <PERSON> Korobkov </PERSON> said. He also said economic cooperatives were buying up to 20 percent of some products, apparently also contributing to shortages. Production of many electric appliances has also stagnated, Trud said. The number of refrigerators produced is in a `` frozen state,'' the paper noted. Last year about the same number were built as in 1980. Trud said that of the 315,000 refrigerators needed to satisfy the anticipated demand in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year, orders had only been filled for 186,300. The capital received 258,000 vacuum cleaners, instead of the 540,000 needed, and only 804,000 irons, instead of the more than 1 million required, Trud said.

 Saudi Arabian Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> called for `` solidarity to bring us all good'' as he opened a meeting Sunday with five other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The minister's statement, carried by the official Saudi press agency, said that low oil prices brought on by overproduction require joint action `` to bring prosperity to our nation and countries.'' The report did not outline what plan <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> might present during the meeting, called to forge a joint strategy to help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prop up deteriorating oil prices.

The meeting at <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here began early Sunday evening. The ministers did not speak to reporters before the single session began. A worldwide oil glut has sent crude prices tumbling as much as $ 8 below the $ 18-a-barrel <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark. Much of the excess crude comes from <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> producers, including <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members collectively are pumping more than 3 million barrels in excess of the aggregate ceiling the cartel agreed to in late 1986 to try to defend the $ 18 price. Many producers have openly ignored their quotas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, for example, renounced its 948,000-barrel-a-day quota and is pumping about 1.5 million barrels daily. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced it will no longer cut production and sacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has exceeded its quota of 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure other overproducers into respecting the quota system. Industry executives and Western diplomats believe that the <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> ministers have to discuss their own quotas and consider means of coercing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into cooperating. The two countries are emerging from an 8-year war; both have said they will pump as much oil as they deem necessary to finance billions of dollars in reconstruction. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has suggested it will cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliamentary speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said Friday that there was `` no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast of the Gulf'' over the oil market `` If we quarrel, the situation will remain as it is now. Why should oil sell at $ 10 or $ 11?'' The Saudi newspaper Arab News noted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> want `` really high revenue, be it by pumping or through high prices by cooperating and cutting prooduction.'' The paper said producers are considering raising the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ceiling by raising members' quotas, but such an arrangement has to wait for the upcoming meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy committee. If all these efforts fail to stem the overproduction problem, `` we are poised for another price crash,'' a senior oil source told the paper.

 Eighty-four demonstrators, including at least two children under 10, were arrested Sunday in a protest against the long-delayed <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Those arrested had climbed a fence with handmade ladders or had blocked plant gates during the finale of a two-day protest against possible low-power testing of the $ 5.6 billion plant later this year. Attendance Saturday was more than 300, and the Sunday figure was about 200. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedum </PERSON>, 88, of <LOCATION> Sanborton </LOCATION>, who had four generations of her family at Sunday's protest, wanted to go over the fence, but held back because of a bad knee. `` If I did n't -LRB- have the knee problem -RRB-, I would have gone over the fence,'' she said. `` This is a very decisive time,'' she said. `` There is so much at stake. They want to start the low-power testing, and I do n't believe in that. Police said nine juveniles among those arrested were not charged. They said the other 75 were charged with criminal trespassing, a violation comparable to a speeding ticket, and released. The first arrests Sunday occurred when about 39 protesters used homemade ladders to scale the 10-foot fence and sat inside plant grounds. Some walked with police officers to a waiting school bus, while others went limp and had to be dragged away. During the fence scaling, more than 100 other demonstrators, including women with infants in strollers, stood outside the fence chanting and beating drums to support those who went over. The protesters also clamped several huge padlocks and chains onto a plant gate, and police brought out a heavy duty bolt cutter to get them off. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has been a target of protests since before construction began in 1976. It was completed in 1986, but has been unable to get a federal operating license. Federal regulators have yet to approve evacuation plans for surrounding communities, including some in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and sort out the financial problems of owners, including main owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January. The protesters marched peacefully from nearby <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Saturday, then held an all-night candlelight vigil outside the gate. In terms of arrests, the protest was the largest since May 1987 when 130 people were arrested at the gates. The biggest was in 1977 when 1,414 people were arrested. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is close to winning a low-power license following recent Nuclear Regulatory Commission decisions. Plant officials hope to start the reactor for low-power tests for the first time later this year. Three people were charged with trespassing Saturday when they joined a tour of the plant being conducted by the pro-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. The three sat in at the plant's reception center and refused to leave at closing Plant officials had a low-key reaction to the protest. `` We agree with the rights of this small group of demonstrators to their protest; we disagree with their position that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is not safe,'' spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. `` The fact is, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has consistently received high marks from federal evaluators.''

<HEAD>Lower Fuel Costs Offset Sharply Higher Food Costs in September</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A large drop in energy costs in September outweighed sharply higher food prices and kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at a moderate 0.4 percent, the government reported. While the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lauded Friday's report as signs that inflation was not heating up, some private economists expressed worries about what could happen if world oil prices suddenly rebound. The September increase represented a drop from an August increase of 0.6 percent. For the first nine months, wholesale prices have been rising at a rate of 4.3 percent. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the inflation report showed a `` clear downward trend'' indicating inflation was under control. The government also reported Friday that retail sales fell for the second straight month in September, declining 0.4 percent because of weakness in auto sales. In another sign that the economy was slowing, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in September, the first month industrial production has failed to increase since last February. The financial markets took the data in stride. Stock prices rode out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little changed, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing 0.18 to close at 2,133.18. An initial rally in the bond market ran out of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose. In the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the economy was not in danger of overheating. Those worries earlier in the year had prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, in an inflation-fighting move, to tighten credit conditions and push interest rates higher. `` The good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked and should decline in coming months,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bad news is not all that bad. The economy is slowing, but only slightly.'' Other economists agreed, although some said they were worried that the underlying inflation rate, after removing the volatile food and energy categories, jumped by 0.6 percent in September, double the rate of increase in August. Some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election and then resume pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen consumer demand. The big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 3.3 percent drop in energy costs, the biggest decline since January and a reflection of the rrent battle among oil-producing nations over production quotas. Offsetting the drop in energy costs, food prices jumped by 1.2 percent last month, three times the rate of increase in August. Another factor pushing prices higher was a 1.8 percent increase in new automobile prices.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Leap Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices have leaped again in reaction to speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil producers would reach an agreement on production cuts at meetings this coming week. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 71 cents Friday to settle at $ 14.92 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Since Tuesday, the November contract has leaped $ 1.37 a barrel, reflecting a sharp turnaround in the mood of the market. A proposal on the table would cut production by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to between 18.5 million and 19.5 million barrels a day, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production recently has been about 21 million barrels a day even though the official ceiling is about 19 million barrels `` It's not a fait accompli,'' said <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, who said he got his information from sources. `` These numbers may not come into existence.'' Oil traders pushed prices so high in anticipation of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> accord that if one fails to materialize, prices could fall back quite rapidly, analysts said. The heaviest buying Friday was by traders who had speculated on a decline in prices and were forced to bail out when the market turned against them, said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a trader and analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The six-member <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which includes four <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, is scheduled to meet Sunday in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee and long-term strategy committee are scheduled to meet jointly in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The price of oil skidded in recent weeks _ trading below $ 12.30 a barrel at one point last week _ because of continued overproduction by cartel members, and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to construct an agreement that will lower output and push prices higher. In other trading on the exchange Friday, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.27 cents to 45.42 cents a gallon. The November contract for home heating oil rose 1.46 cents to settle at 43.21 cents a gallon.
