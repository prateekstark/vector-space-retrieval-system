<HEAD>Crowds Grow As Heavy Metal Trial Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-ager testified Wednesday in a $ 2.6 million lawsuit against the heavy metal rock group <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crew </ORGANIZATION> that flying pieces of dry ice from a flaming special-effects pot on stage split his lip during a 1985 show. `` I could feel straight through to my teeth,'' said 19-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. On Tuesday, the second plaintiff in the case, 17-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said lost an eye to flying debris during the concert in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. Named as defendants in the suit are the band, the city of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Von </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, promoter of the concert. Attorneys for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> contend illegal fireworks were used as special effects, and that city and civic center officials were negligent in allowing their use. About 30 teen-agers cut class to catch a glimpse Wednesday of the band's bass player, <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON> needed a police escort to reach his car after testifying Tuesday. Some 300 fans stood outside as he departed that day. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> testified that he was standing about 20 feet from the stage when the accident took place. He said <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crue </PERSON> had just begun the song `` Shout to the Devil'' when he saw flames shoot up on either side of the drummer. Then, he said, `` something come out and hit me,'' splitting his lip before he could cover his face. He said when he looked down, he saw blood and what looked like crushed ice. When he stepped on it, he said, his foot slipped as if the object were melting. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> testifed Tuesday that he heard a `` big boom'' and saw flames just before something object struck him in the face during the concert. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 14 at the time and attending his first rock concert, said his first thought was that the lights at the arena had been turned off. `` But when I reached up and felt my eye,'' he said, `` there was nothing there.'' <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON> testified Tuesday it was `` impossible'' that the teen-agers were injured by the band's special effects. <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON> said the band continued to use the pyrotechnic displays in concerts after the incident in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. `` I do three to four hundred shows with the stuff right next to me. It has to be safe,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> returned to television Wednesday despite a writers strike, giving a monologue of his own making in which he wisecracked that astrology in the White House finally explains `` the loony tunes things that have been coming out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` The Tonight Show'' had been in reruns since shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> struck the film and TV industry March 7. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> announced last week that reruns of the show would end and he would return to the air, writing his own monologues. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, who is not a member of the guild, said at that time possibilities of reaching an agreement with striking writers had been exhausted. On Wednesday, he said the real reason for coming back stemmed from the brouhaha over revelations about the influence of astrology in the White House. `` I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` I'm a Scorpio on the cusp. ... You know, we finally have a clue now as to what the hell -LRB- are -RRB- the loony tunes things that have been coming out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> referred to revelations by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> that first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consulted an astrologer to determine the timing of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s movements <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he had not been aware there was a new Cabinet position, Secretary of Health, Education and Soothsaying. He also made brief mention of the strike in both a sincere and joking tone. `` We're glad to be back. As far as the writers strike we're not going to discuss it,'' he said. `` I have a lot of friends who are writers. We hope they join us soon. It is not fun to come to work when you see your friends who you've known for many years standing out on a picket line. Then he quipped, `` And it's a weird picket line. The writers are out there holding up these signs and there's nothing on them.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> explained to out-of-towners that there had been excitement in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because of persistent rumors that Nostradamus, a 16th century astrologer, forecast an earthquake for a city widely believed to be <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> observed. `` If Nostradamus were alive today he would be <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>,'' he said, referring to the TV personality who opened <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s vault to great hype but found next to nothing. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s production company, <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was rebuffed in efforts to get either a waiver from the guild or reach an independent agreeement that would permit the writers to return to work.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration intends to sell advanced F-18 fighter-bombers to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a deal that would make the tiny <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state the first <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to have them, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Citing unidentified sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and State departments, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> wants to buy 40 of the aircraft and the administration will notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon of its intention to proceed with the sale. The deal could be worth $ 680 million to the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Several <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night said they were unaware that any decision had been made. One noted that Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had told a congessional panel Tuesday that `` there was a request from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to look at the possibility of selling F-18s.'' Another source, who also spoke on condition that he not be named, said, `` I'm not aware that any decision is imminent.'' `` There's no more than the possibility of a sale,'' he said, adding that he was skeptical that such a decision would have been made so quickly. `` I would doubt it very seriously,'' he said. `` There's interest, but a lot of discussion needs to go on before any decision like that would be considered I think it's awful early. I would be very surprised if it's true.'' The source noted that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has talked to several countries, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, about the possibility of buying advanced aircraft. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had told the congressional panel Tuesday that the administration had alerted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was interested in the F-18s and might prefer them to the less sophisticated F-16s. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could block the sale. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is selling F-16s to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, but it has n't sold F-18s to any Arab nation, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have created an increasingly close security relationship since last year, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committed naval forces to protect U.S.-flagged ships traveling through the war-torn <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Initially, 11 Kuwaiti ships were re-flagged under this policy and were given protection by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recently revised its policy in the gulf, announcing that it would offer help to other ships that were attacked by combatants in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war

<HEAD>Church Universal and Triumphant: A Threat in Paradise Valley?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Here in a mile-high valley called Paradise, a religious group is building its home, a retreat for thousands that some local people say threatens the pristine environment bordering Yellowstone National Park. The group is the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triumphant </ORGANIZATION>, a `` New Age'' sect that moved its headquarters in late 1986 from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to a 12,000-acre ranch it had bought five years earlier in southwest <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. With that move came 200 followers, doubling the number already there, construction plans for a self-sufficient community, and the promise of more church members moving into a valley with a population of about 1,000. Next door is <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, whose wildlife herds often migrate into the valley during the winter. `` This is a place of international significance,'' says <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rate </PERSON>, a local resident. `` If they do what they say they want to do, that value is going to be diminished _ not only for our time, but for all time.'' Rate and others fear the group's building plans and its summer conclaves that attract thousands will cause environmental damage in the valley. Some critics say they're uncomfortable with the group's beliefs. The church was founded 30 years ago in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, who said he received messages from spiritual figures of the past, including <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON>. Upon his death in 1973, his widow, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, became the leader. Church members believe a human soul is continuously reincarnated until people realize the God within themselves. They use praying or chanting to attempt to influence world conditions or personal concerns. Tobacco, alcohol and drugs are forbidden. Ms. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, 47, says her visions suggest a war between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before the end of this century. The church supports President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative and a nationwide civil defense system. `` We have a lot of down-home, nice type of folks on this ranch who are just like the people that are our neighbors,'' Ms. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON> says. `` I do n't think that all the hullaballoo that's been made in the press is the reality here.'' Critics draw comparisons between <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the tiny town of <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, taken over in the early 1980s and then abandoned by followers of the Baghwan <PERSON> Shree </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>. Church Universal and Triumphant bought some modular housing from the defunct Rajneeshee community, but church leaders say the similarities end there. Since the church bought the ranch in 1981, its leaders have hit the local Rotary and <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> club circuit to calm fears that it is a far-out religious cult bent on political control. Church vice president <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, married to Ms. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, says church members' political persuasion generally resembles that of the area _ conservative and Republican. Not everyone is reassured. `` I'm concerned about the numbers,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, whose 2,000-acre property borders the church's <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>. `` No matter what they happen to believe, it's still an awful lot of people to bring into a fragile area.'' Church officials counter that they chose the valley because of its natural beauty, which they want to preserve. The church bought the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 from magazine publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> for a reported $ 7 million. Since then, the church has purchased an additional 21,500 acres in the <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, including 5,200 acres of hilly prairie near Emigrant intended for settlement by church members, about 25 miles north of the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>. It also owns a printing shop in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION> that employs 100 people. The church wo n't reveal its income but says it comes from members' donations and various business ventures, largely the sale of religious books and videotapes. It also leases land to members. The church has advertised the ranch to its members as a spiritual retreat offering protection from economic collapse, civil disorder or war. Thousands of followers gather each summer for an annual conclave in a spectacular mountain valley called the `` Heart of the Inner Retreat.'' Ms. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> say the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> will become a monastic, self-sufficient community for 500 or so church members. With the help of ranch `` staff'' _ church members who receive room, board and small monthly salaries _ the church has installed an extensive irrigation system, grows a wide variety of vegetables and grains, operates a dairy and raises 2,500 head of cattle and sheep. Members also began work in 1986 on the development's central complex. Located near the west bank of the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> several miles north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, it would include housing for 260, a church, school, kitchen, dining hall and recreation facilities. But that work halted in November 1986 when the state, prodded by local residents, launched an environmental review. A draft of the review, completed in March, said the project should be able to proceed without damaging wildlife, water quality or aesthetics, as long as the church takes several steps to cushion impact of the development. The state found no threat to the environment that would justify denying sewage and water permits, if the conditions were met. Following a public comment period _ `` We were overwhelmed with comment, both for and against,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilcher </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> _ the state is completing a final report. The draft said the church should build a bear-proof fence around a tree farm and vegetable fields, monitor groundwater, maintain minimum flows in three creeks crossing ranch property and postpone any use of a geothermal spring near the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The church wants to pump water from <LOCATION> LaDuke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for use at its central complex. Park officials are concerned the pumping might affect <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> nine miles to the south. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> says the church is willing to accept the recommendations, but a number of groups have suggested the state review is inadequate. Since the 1970s, the church has occupied and later abandoned land in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ `` a series of steps to get here,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> says, adding that the church has no intention of moving again. But critics say the church has not been forthcoming about its plans in the past. `` Basically, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>' credibility with me is zero,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, owner of an outdoor equipment shop in nearby <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a local environmental group. `` If he told me it was Thursday, I'd check the calendar.'' When Church Universal and Triumphant bought the ranch, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said its rural nature would not be changed. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> maintains he has been largely consistent: `` I feel that a 1 percent use of property in this area for anything other than open space and wildlife is appropriate and not something that should cause a lot of alarm.'' Parks says the church `` changes the ambience of the whole area,'' bringing the impact of a development but no direct economic benefits. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> contends that what's really bothering the critics is simpler: They just do n't want others to have a piece of their paradise.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s statue still dominates a square in central <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, but the man who towered over <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> for 32 years has slipped into oblivion six months after his ouster. His successor as president, <PERSON> Zine </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Abidine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, has proclaimed a `` new era'' for the North African nation, appealing to the nation's Islamic and Arabic heritage, a stand that has won him immediate widespread support. <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>, who had set the nation on a Western course after he won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1956, now is 84 years old and confined to a chateau outside <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. He was declared no longer capable of governing when he was removed from office Nov. 7. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> took power during a tense crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists and is universally credited, even by political opponents, with sparing the nation from a more serious upheaval. He has sought to make peace with the Islamic fundamentalists and others in the Bourguiba opposition. Newspapers once banned by <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> are back on newsstands. Many people say they no longer fear the police. <ORGANIZATION> Tunis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, disrupted three days a week last year by demonstrations, is quiet. About 5,000 prisoners, many of them members of an outlawed Islamic fundamentalist group, have been pardoned. The national legislature, dominated by <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s ruling party since <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s independence in 1956, has moved toward pluralism with a new law on political parties. In his most risky move, however, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has extended a hand to the growing Islamic fundamentalist movement, <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s chief target in his waning years. Television and radio now broadcast the five daily calls to Islamic prayer. Islam has alway been the official state religion, but <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> maintained a secular character in government and daily life. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a military man once in charge of the crackdown on fundamentalists, invokes Allah -LRB- God -RRB- at the start of his speeches. `` It's life that's changed, not just politics,'' said <PERSON> Chakib </PERSON> <PERSON> Douss </PERSON>, a brassware merchant in the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> bazaar. `` Now everyone is free. We feel it every day, every minute. It's not something you read about in the newspaper. It's something you touch.'' Many in the opposition approved of the new climate, if only for now. `` Incontestably, Nov. 7 was a comfort to everyone,'' said a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It's still the honeymoon, so everyone feels obliged to publicly approve him,'' commented <PERSON> M'hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaibi </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the weekly Maghreb, reopened in September after being shut down four years ago. `` I hope this is a temporary situation,'' he said of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s popularity `` Otherwise, we'll be back in the old system with a president who thinks he is infallible.'' That was an allusion as well to <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>, who had become so dominant that he was declared president-for-life, a benign dictator in charge of a nominal democracy. His Destourian <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controlled all seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. None of the three legal opposition parties had a meaningful voice. But <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has promised that his new era would `` open the horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life.'' Since taking office, he has moved to abolish the lifelong presidency, change the electoral code and press laws, dismantle the feared state security court and given <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, a permit to operate here _ its first in the Arab world. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has also restored diplomatic relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and stresses closer ties with the Arab world. While citizens appear won over by the changes, some opposition politicians remain cautious and fundamentalists are reserving full judgment. The final year of <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s leadership was marked by a battle against the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tendency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, culminating in a trial in September of 90 fundamentalists on charges of plotting against the state. `` The Islamic dossier remains the hottest one on <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s desk,'' said <PERSON> Hassen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghodhbani </PERSON>, an Islamic lawyer who defended some of the 90 in the trial He contended the measures taken by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> remain insufficient. `` Islam is n't just prayer and pilgrimage. It's an entire life system,'' he said. In late April, the legislature quashed any hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tendency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> might become a legal opposition party _ one of its demands. A new law allowed new political parties but forbade those based on religion, language, race or region. `` The government has adopted a double attitude toward Islam,'' said the opposition politician who spoke anonymously. `` It is a position both clever and dangerous.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s shipbuilding orders decreased more than 40 percent so far this year from the same period in 1987 because of a rapid appreciation in the country's currency, industry officials said today Orders received so far consist of 626,300 gross tons of export ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships, the officials said. But they added that despite the sluggish orders, local shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6 million tons, enough to keep them busy until the first half of next year. The value of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> won has risen 7.43 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar so far this year. A higher won makes South Korean exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of foreign imports.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won back first place in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television ratings from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and became the first network in more than seven years to claim the nine top shows. Because of the May sweeps, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> broadcast mostly original programs for the week that ended Sunday. They face summer reruns and a drought imposed by the scriptwriters' strike. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> finished more than four ratings points ahead of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in gaining its 28th victory in 33 weeks. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won the previous week largely on the strength of the final episode of `` Magnum, P.I.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also won the top nine places, the first time a network has done that since <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for the week of Nov. 3, 1980. `` Cheers'' took first place. The only non-NBC show to make the top 10 was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' Besides regular series, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The Taking of Flight 847: The <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> Story'' was seventh and the first half of the miniseries `` Something Is Out There'' was ninth. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Bourne Identity'' was in 11th place with its opening chapter. It teamed up with the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday show `` Something Is Out There'' to send the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> drama `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' to 58th place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s average rating for the week was 15.6; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' was 11.5 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11.2. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. In the May sweeps, which helps determine advertising rates for local stations, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> took over first place from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. The ratings in the Nielsen sweeps for April 28-May 8: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.9, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 13.1, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.4. The Arbitron sweeps for April 27-May 8: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.8, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 12.9, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.7. `` The Cosby Show'' was the only rerun in the top 10 and, in fact the only one in the top 36 shows last week. More than half the shows in the bottom half of the ratings also were new. Here are the top 10: `` Cheers,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Night Court,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Monday Movie, `` The Taking of Flight 847: The <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' `` Amen,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday Movie, `` Something Is Out There,'' Part I, all <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> kept its lead among the evening news shows. The ratings: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.2, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 9.3, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 8.6.

<HEAD>Agnes de Mille's `The Informer' Ballet Opens in NY</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Informer,'' a new ballet choreographed by <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mille </PERSON> for American Ballet Theater, is a gripping anti-war work certain to become a favorite of audiences for years to come. It's a strong ballet, crisp, clear and deeply felt, with light moments and ominous ones, danced against sets with glowering gray skies. Based on the 1935 movie about strife in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> between 1916 and 1921, it is set to Celtic songs, and every wave of the hand, flip or sweep of a scarf and every jig-like jump is identifiably Irish. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was danced with muscular eloquence. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> danced the wounded veteran, <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Renvall </PERSON> the young fighter and red-haired <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> the girl. A corps de ballet of 20, as Dubliners, danced superbly. Miss <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mille </PERSON> had <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> as Irish step-dancing consultant. The choreographer used the timing of quick Irish dance steps, as well as the way feet turn and legs cross each other. The story is crystal clear, almost all of it in dance with very little relying on mime. The young fighter, whose steps are carefree, likes the girl _ and other girls. She likes him but when he leaves with somebody else she flirts with the veteran, who holds one gloved hand, presumably artificial, close to his waist. The veteran is self-conscious, has intense feeling for the girl _ he lifts her with one hand _ and is jealous. So he points out the young fighter to unseen English soldiers. Women mourn the young fighter, heads thrown back then down, mouths silently screaming. In one enormously effective scene, the veteran is alone as dawn comes, revealing silhouettes of men hanged by the English. The veteran tries to strut but is stiff, unable to free his body from his realization of what he did. In the next scene, the girl finds consolation dancing with the veteran. But he confesses to her and she runs in horror to her friends. They shun her at first but take her into their measured line dancing. When the veteran arrives, there is a long silence before two men walk him into the wings. At the end of the half-hour dance Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mille </ORGANIZATION>, who suffered a stroke in 1975, walked on stage arm in arm with company artistic director <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>. The audience, which had watched the ballet in rapt silence, stood to applaud, and bravos rang out. `` The Informer'' was premiered in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in March.

 More than 1,000 employees stopped work at a construction plant in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and demanded their March wages and a pay increase, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.

 A Japanese monkey on the loose for 10 months in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is feasting on bananas, peanut butter and cat food this week while authorities try to figure out how to capture the wily fugitive. `` He's been here twice today so far,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, who spotted the Japanese macaque last week and began feeding it. `` He ate peanut butter sandwiches yesterday because I was out of bananas,'' she said Tuesday. `` He liked them real well, except he got real disgusted when he got peanut butter between his _ I guess you would call them his fingers.'' The Japanese macaque, dubbed `` Jack the Macaque'' by Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, stands about 3 -LCB- feet tall, weighs about 30 pounds and has a silky, tan coat. Macaques are generally found in southern <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the East Indies. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, a resourceful little primate, survived the winter apparently by foraging. Conservation officers say he runs away as soon as someone in uniform appears. `` He's a pretty smart monkey,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ault </PERSON>, conservation officer at <LOCATION> Paynetown </LOCATION>. `` He's kind of allergic to uniforms.'' He escaped about 10 months ago from the Reptile Kingdom in <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 35 miles from Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>' home here near the Hoosier National Forest. Attempts to recapture the monkey have failed. On Friday, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> turned up his nose at three tranquilized bananas in favor of a dish of cat food behind the <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>' house. `` He had n't done that before,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. `` Then he went out and sat down by the bananas and took a couple of bites and spit them out.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> was a little woozy, but made it back to the woods. When Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> first saw the monkey last Wednesday she called her husband, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, who was at work. While he phoned the sheriff's department, she offered <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> some apples, carrots and bread `` He just kind of looked at me like, ` Oh, please.' I did n't really know what to do,'' she said `` I did n't want to scare him away, so I did what I thought -LRB- ape researcher -RRB- <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodall </PERSON> would do, I squatted down low so that I was about his size.'' When the police car pulled up, the monkey grabbed an apple and carrot and ran for the woods. The animal is n't considered especially dangerous, though Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said owner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> told her the monkey might attack if he felt threatened. `` He's just as cute as he can be,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, adding that she wo n't be too disappointed if future attempts to recapture the monkey also fail. `` I know the owner wants him back,'' she said. `` But I just could n't stand for them to drug him.''

 A man accused of killing 16 people, including 14 family members, grinned as he squeezed off shots during a 45-minute rampage at four businesses, according to people he allegedly shot or tried to shoot. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, a 47-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant, is being tried in the fatal shootings of former co-worker <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, Dec. 28 in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Four people were wounded. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is scheduled to face a separate trial July 18 in the slayings of 14 relatives. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, who told the jury he would ask for the death penalty, said in his opening statement that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, a legal secretary, was shot at least four times in the head as she sat at her desk. Officials have said she had spurned <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' advances a year earlier. Police have said <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> was a chance victim of shooting several minutes later at <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, several blocks from the law office. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had once worked at the oil company and had been the boss of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, whom he allegedly wounded there. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, shot in the forehead at a small market he owned and where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had once worked, said that when <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> `` squeezed the first shot, he was grinning.'' A witness in the convenience store shooting, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Carta </PERSON>, said he saw <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> lean over a counter of the market and shoot cashier <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolery </PERSON> in the face. The bullet went in her mouth and out her jaw. Both <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who showed their scars to the jury, identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> as the man who shot them. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered after another shooting at a motor freight company, where he allegedly wounded a woman who once had been his boss. Earlier, <PERSON> Juli </PERSON> <PERSON> Money </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> at the oil company, testified that she saw <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> shot on what was her first day at work. She said she heard shots, then saw a door fly open as <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> reached for it. `` I saw an arm raise up through a window in the door. It shot and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> went down,'' she testified. Ms. <PERSON> Money </PERSON> said she was trying to see what was going on and `` wondering whether it was a practical joke'' when `` <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> stepped over his body, took a stance, and pointed the gun at me. I screamed, ` No,' and dived behind some boxes. `` He was grinning. He had a horrid grin _ it looked like he had false teeth _ and his eyes were wide open.'' She said she grabbed her head because `` I thought I had been shot because I felt the heat from the bullet'' as it whizzed past. She was uninjured. After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered, the bodies of his wife and 13 other relatives were found on his property in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, 47 miles east of <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION>. If convicted of murder, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> could be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> asked for the maximum penalty on all charges, while <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Doc </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, urged that the jurors `` not be bullied by public opinion, by what the press may say or by what the public may say.'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> asked jurors to consider conflicting statements given by witnesses in describing the gunman. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> testified Tuesday that she was in the law office on business when <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> came in and stood in front of Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>'s desk. The man had his hands in his pockets but jerked his right arm up and started firing a pistol, she testified. `` He missed her at first,'' she said. `` She just stood there. He kept shooting. Finally, he hit her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she was afraid to move and put her head down. When she looked up, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> glanced at her and walked out, she said. Asked by <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> why she had not identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> when she saw him at the police department on Dec. 28, Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had kept his head down. She identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on Jan. 13 from photographs. About 60 spectators were in the courtoom, including relatives of some of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' family members. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, 36, of <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, whose brother was among the dead family members, said, `` We've got our grief to deal with and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has got God to deal with.'' <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON>, 51, sister of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' late wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shields </PERSON>, 53, both of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Payne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said they sat in the front row because they wanted to make certain that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> saw them. `` It's hard for us not to have some hate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes For Panel To Determine Military Closings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has decided to create a buffer against the political consequences of deciding which of the nation's 3,600 military installationver the proposal that was tacked onto a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. Studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have estimated that between $ 1 billion and $ 5 billion a year can be saved if unneeded bases can be closed. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, summed up the political dilemma Tuesday when he told colleagues: `` The real issue is one that concerns each of us _ and that is the potential loss of jobs in our states and resulting economic dislocations. These are very real concerns.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., said, `` There is a perception in the country, and I think it's accurate, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not act to close a single base because of the political ramifications. The Pentagon has not closed any major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations since 1977, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> erected a series of stiff legal barriers to the periodic attempts to pare down the nation's military infrastructure. The Pentagon last proposed closing bases in 1985, when it said 22 facilities could be shut down. But that idea ran into a storm of opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and was later dropped. As it works through the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is also trying to answer another politically tricky question of whether to have the military more deeply involved in the anti-drug fight. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday he opposes such moves. `` I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, is appropriate'' for the military, he told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` I think it is unwise to get the military into the law enforcement question. ... Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-23 last week to order President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the military seal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against drug traffickers and a similar plan is expected to be offered to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders are searching for a compromise on some type of anti-drug plan, much as the base-closing commission proposal was hammered out among congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in recent months. Legislators agreed that base closings should be considered in the effort to stretch increasingly scarce dollars in the federal budget, but wanted to be sure they had a say in the process. The original commission plan proposed a nine-member panel, but Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., opposed that, saying it would give `` absolute power to the Department of Defense. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., agreed, noting that `` the publics in our communities rely on these bases ... When these bases are closed, it better not look political.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> admitted that closing bases, and the resulting loss of jobs, is politically sensitive. But he added that `` I hope we can close some. ... I know there are some that are unneeded.'' The 15-member commission would include the nine members already announced by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and six more <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will appoint with the approval of key legislators. The commission is supposed to finish its work by Dec. 31, and if it proposes a list of installations to be closed, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will have to accept or reject the entire list. His decision can be blocked only by a vote of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., said, `` In light of our current budgetary deficit, the need to save $ 2 billion a year is clear and obvious. The commission proposal is not in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget measure, but that chamber is expected to consider a separate bill which includes the commission. The competing bills that will be approved in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> eventually will go to a conference committee to reconcile differences, including the base-closing plan. Both bills authorize $ 299.5 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Administration Lowering Expectations for Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is adopting a `` What, me worry?'' attitude on whether <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> inaction on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty will cloud the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit due to start May 29. And according to several private experts, the stance may be justified. Not more than two weeks ago, summit planners were confident that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be able to crown three years of summitry by exchanging the final, fully ratified documents of the INF treaty the superpowers had been negotiating off and on since 1981. After all, the pact had run the gantlet of hearings, past senators eager to hack away at the treaty, and it emerged with only a few dents. Head counters expected that only a dozen or so senators would vote no on final ratification and that the vote could occcur before the summit. To complete the INF process in time for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meetings seemed doubly important because it had become clear that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were still far from reaching their goal of a 30 percent to 50 percent cut in long-range missiles and bombers _ the so-called START agreement. The leaders would be saying, in essence, `` Well, we've stumbled a bit on START, but let's not dwell on it; signing this final, ratified, INF pact will give us a chance to remind the world we can make progress on arms control.'' In the past two weeks, however, glitches have emerged in the INF treaty, mostly over the meaning of verification provisions, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has decided to postpone ratification work indefinitely. The administration is optimistic it will clear away the differences in time for the summit, but that is unlikely to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> time to act. Is the administration worried the failure will hurt the summit? `` Of course not,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said on Tuesday. Like other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the differences between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets are merely technical and will be resolved. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fails to act in time for the summit, it can do the work afterward and the ratification documents can be exchanged later in the year. The treaty will eliminate ground-launched missiles with ranges between 315 miles and 3,125 miles. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today to meet Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to try to resolve the INF differences and the administration officials predicted that if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his negotiators are willing to shake hands on a settlement, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will go along. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, believes that with the failure of the superpowers to reach agreement on long-range systems, the spotlight at the summit will be on human rights and regional issues rather than on arms control. Theoretically, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could try to win propaganda points by raising the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s ratification delay as an alleged example of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hesitancy to end the arms race, <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON> said. `` But that's not likely, because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants the summit to be a success for domestic and international reasons,'' <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON> said. `` We do n't need an INF treaty ratified in time for the summit, we just need it not to be scuttled and that's not going to happen,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> consultant and expert on Soviet military affairs. `` Remember, the vast majority of people in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> want to ratify the INF treaty eventually,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, a foreign policy analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, asserted that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s inaction on the INF treaty reflected members' unease with the treaty despite overwhelming constituent support for approval. The last-minute disagreements over verification `` give them a chance to keep nit-picking so they do n't have to ratify it.'' <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> added: `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants the summit to show his nation he is a commanding figure on the world stage. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to put on a show to keep his approval rating high for as long as he can. `` If they ca n't sign an INF treaty they'll find something else to do with some pizazz.''

<HEAD>Plastic Handgun Ban Clears House, Prospects Good in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to ban undetectable plastic firearms could clear the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this Thursday, just two days after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a similar bill with a calm that rarely accompanies gun control measures. A smooth ride for the legislation was virtually assured two weeks ago, after Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and law enforcement groups agreed to a compromise version _ and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> went along. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to avoid a bruising gun control battle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it became clear that no existing handguns would be prohibited under the agreement. Plastic guns are not yet a reality, but chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Tuesday the firearms could be a weapon of choice for terrorists in the future. His colleagues agreed, passing the bill 413-4. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, meanwhile cleared a similar bill by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> for action by the full committee. The full panel meets again on Thursday, and the gun bill is on the agenda. The Hughes bill would make it illegal to manufacture, import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm, defined as a weapon with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. Maximum penalties would be five years in prison, and fines of $ 250,000 for individuals and $ 1 million for organizations. The bill contains a `` sunset'' provision that would repeal the criminal provisions after five years, enabling the law to keep pace with any advances that may occur in firearms detection technology. Voting against the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure were Republican Reps. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' bill was introduced before the administration-police compromise, but embodies the same concept. The more precise language is in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, which would establish a detectability standard that would permit detection of the same weapons as the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> bill. However, it does not provide for a minimum content of metal in the gun. Both measures would detect all existing hanguns, thus keeping them legal for law-abiding owners. But plastic weapons that failed to meet the same metallic standard would be prohibited. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote `` a major step in the right direction. I look forward to working with Congressman <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sends the president the strongest bill possible,'' he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he saw no problem in working out a compromise between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language. A Winter Park, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, company that claims to be the leader in plastic firearms technology says it has no plans to produce plastic handguns. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunoehler </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was working on a plastic machine gun grenade launcher that it hopes to sell to the Marines. `` We see the military business as where we want to be,'' he said, adding the company will be working on that project for at least the next two years. He said the company also has pledged never to make an undetectable plastic weapon.

<HEAD>Wheat Harvest Forecast Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1988 winter wheat harvest could be around 1.62 billion bushels if the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s initial forecast is borne out, up 4 percent from last year's production. Based on surveys May 1, the average yield of this year's harvest is expected to be 40.7 bushels per acre, compared with 39.8 bushels per acre in 1987 when winter wheat output was 1.56 billion bushels. Farmers are expected to have about 39.8 million acres for harvest this year, up 1 percent from 39.3 million in 1987. `` As of May 1, over 60 percent of the winter wheat in the major producing states rated in good or better condition,'' said the department's report Tuesday. `` Another 28 percent is rated in fair condition.'' Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production. The outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened, reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in once-awesome <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles. In a related supply-and-demand report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected total wheat production this year, based on historical trends, at 2.17 billion bushels, up slighly from 2.1 billion bushels in 1987. That would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for harvest later in the year. The report also projected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile is expected to decline further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the coming marketing year on May 31, 1989, compared with more than 1.23 billion bushels of old-crop wheat expected to be carried over this June 1. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asssociation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said the expected reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead. Does that mean the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is running low on wheat after the recent years of huge surpluses? `` That's relatively correct,'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said. `` And if we're going to stay in the world market, we're going to have to have adequate supplies for our customers That's why we feel the acreage reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the opportunity to market more bushels in the 1989 season.'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> referred to a farm law provision that limits <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to no more than a 20 percent land-idling requirement when the wheat stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels. At a projected 796 million bushels on May 31, 1989, that would be well below the mark. For the last two years the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has required wheat farmers to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for supports and other federal benefits. <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said the association wants to see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and 20 percent. Wheat market prices were projected for 1988-89 at an average range of $ 2.80 to $ 3.20 per bushel, compared with $ 2.55 estimated for 1987-88. The indicated production of winter wheat, based on May 1, prospects, are listed here. The first numbers show the total production in thousands of bushels. The second numbers are the average yields per acre for the major states.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be headed for another bumper grain harvest, which the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says could dampen import requirements if wheat quality improves from the last couple of years. In its first forecast of this year's Soviet grain production, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that 1988 production could be 215 million metric tons of grain, up 2 percent from last year's bumper output of 211.4 million tons. The department said the harvests could include 92 million tons of wheat, 109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye, barley, oats and corn, and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses, which include peas and beans. Officials said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in grain imports, particularly wheat. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been selling the Soviets huge quantities of wheat lately, all of it at subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. If the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast, it would be the third year in a row that Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons, an unprecedented feat for that country. It also would be the third largest Soviet grain output, exceeded by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the 1976 harvest of 223.8 million tons. However, officials said the 1988 forecast is `` highly tentative'' and that it `` will be modified as the season progresses by both positive and negative factors, including weather developments.''

<HEAD>Growth In Transpacific Travel Will Mean Boom In Supersonics</HEAD>

 By the end of the century there will be a need for a new civilian transport plane capable of carrying 247 passengers on 5,000-mile trips at two to three times the speed of sound, says a new study. That will open a $ 200 billion-plus market for the country which first manufactures the new generation of supersonic planes for civilian use in the years 2000 to 2010, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The agency, however, recommended against building a production transport faster than three times the speed of sound, saying that would involve `` too great a price and with too great a delay in reaching operational service.'' At Mach 2.7, an airplane could fly from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in under four hours. A body traveling at <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 1 would be traveling at the speed of sound, and <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 2 would equal twice the speed of sound. The study said growth in travel across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> will justify designing and building a supersonic transport. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had such an effort under way in the 1960s, but abandoned it because of noise-pollution problems and the high cost of fuel. `` Many technologies are much more advanced today,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> study said. `` Weight reduction and aircraft shaping are the best methods of reducing the sonic boom heard at ground level. New design methods for shaping are just now becoming avialable.'' The aircraft eventually would fly twice as far as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concorde </ORGANIZATION>, which has a range of 3,350 miles. The new generation of airplanes would not be the `` Orient Express'' that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> envisioned in his State of the Union message two years ago when he announced research for a plane capable of flying 25 times the speed of sound and thus able to go into orbit. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> jointly are now carrying out research for such a hypersonic plane and a decision will be made in 1990 on whether to build it at a cost of $ 3.3 billion. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> program managers believe research for the long-range commercial market should now focus on getting the highest speed possible out of a conventionally fueled, high-speed transport,'' the agency said. Two studies were performed for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms building large transports. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> studies indicate that, by the year 2000, a fleet of 1,200 large, subsonic aircraft would be needed to carry the estimated worldwide, long-range traffic of 315,000 passengers per day,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` By comparison, less than 800 supersonic transports, each carrying 247 passengers as far as 5,000 nautical miles, could serve the same markets.'' Timeliness in providing a viable and competitive vehicle is important if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to capture a major portion of the high-speed transport market, estimated to be over $ 200 billion, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. It added: `` This market could be an important factor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sustaining a positive balance of trade in the aerospace market.'' The federal government would not be a financial partner in building an SST, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it has a clear charter to pursue the technologies and reduce the financial risk to aircraft builders. `` It then would be up to industry to build and sell the high-speed, civil transport on their own,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>Fisheries, Environmentalists Agree On Truce Over Coastal Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Environmental organizations and a segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing industry say they will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow the incidental killing of marine mammals by fishermen to continue into the 1990s. Spokesmen for the two normally combative groups announced Tuesday they had reached a three-year truce in their long-standing tussle over the killing of sea mammals off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast. `` They're going to give us a three-year lease on life,'' said <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON> of Natural Resources Consultants, who said he was speaking for commercial fishing interests in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricklemyer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> lawyer speaking for a coalition of environmental organizations, said the pact is designed to end the threat that recent court decisions could put many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen out of business in 1989. The court rulings said that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could not issue new 1989 permits to fishermen to kill mammals unless it could demonstrate that this would not deplete the population of a specific mammal. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> say they lack adequate information to make such declarations on a number of air-breathing sea creatures. The agreement, if it is accepted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would allow continued issuance of permits for the incidental killing of many mammals through 1991 in return for commercial fishery cooperation in obtaining data on their populations. The plan also calls for limits on the numbers of northern fur seals and northern sea lions that can be taken by fishermen, who often find portions of their catch snatched away by sea mammals before they can be landed. The agreement, which deals with coastal fishing, does not address the problem of dolphins killed by tuna fishermen in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Part of the agreement calls for outside observers to be on fishing boats. <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON> said he wants the federal government to pay the $ 2 million to $ 2 -LCB- million needed each year to hire 35 observers. <PERSON> Bricklemyer </PERSON> said environmentalists agreed to the three-year hiatus in return for the fishing industry educating its members about mammal protection and collecting data that can be used to make decisions about whether a particular mammal is facing depletion. `` We had two choices: shut down the industry, which nobody wanted to do, or find out what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Bricklemyer </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON>'s group and the environmentalists would work together to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the court rulings. <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON> said: `` There is a growing recognition in the fishing community that we have to live with the interests of the environmental community. ... You ca n't keep going on flailing at each other.'' The agreement was announced shortly before the start of a hearing on marine mammal protection by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment. Asked his opinion of the agreement, subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., said: `` I do n't know I have n't looked at it yet.'' A wildlife lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that environmental groups made the deal in order to try to salvage something from expected action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year to overturn the court rulings.

<HEAD>Panel Learns When A Spending Cut Is Not A Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The national panel created to solve the national budget problem is quickly learning that balancing the government's checkbook first means decoding some artful accounting. `` If we did this in business, they'd lock us up,'' said commission member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> chairman, after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday held its first public hearing on federal budget practices. Experts told the commission the history of the convoluted budget process and the scope of the deficit problem, which has already saddled taxpayers with paying back principal and interest on more than $ 2.5 trillion in debt. The tone among the commission members was often jocular in reaction to testimony about federal budgeting oddities. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Muris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who until last year worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, described how a `` cut'' can really be an increase in spending. That's because budget writers work from projections of inflated program costs instead of current spending levels. `` I thought I was pretty good when I was in government, but I was a rank amateur,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a Democrat who is co-chairman of the commission. `` Think of it as a 20 percent cut from a 50 percent markup,'' quipped <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. But former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> made clear he did n't think the concept was funny when it applied to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. Cutting the military short of inflationary increases is `` a very real reduction,'' he said. `` There is nothing in the world situation which justifies that kind of cutback,'' he said, referring to recent budget restraints. `` That is a reality and it is a very unhappy reality for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said the first task of the commission should be to streamline the budget process, but the witnesses did not agree. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> secretary and currently the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, announced that the group intended to produce its recommendation by Dec. 21, more than two months ahead of its statutory deadline. The revised schedule would give the 12-member commission a great chance of influencing policies of the next president, who will get to appoint two more commission members after November's election. `` We are not looking at this as a partisan mission,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, told the commission that reducing the deficit will be a difficult task and efforts so far have had mixed results. `` It seems like we're on a treadmill _ we're running to stay in place,'' she said. But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, was optimistic. `` We're talking about a situation that's within our capacity to solve. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the budget mechanisms have worked well when there's a consensus to be carried out. Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> both used it to achieve their initial legislative successes when they took office, she said. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, director of federal budget policy for the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said procedures could be improved but `` the budget process is not the problem.'' `` It will always be subservient to politics,'' he said.

 Legislation setting new ground rules for filing damage suits against manufacturers of hazardous products survived its initial test in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, but its chances of passing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year are still considered minimal. Consumer activists suffered a setback Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected two proposals by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., that would have expanded the product liability bill's narrow list of legal grounds available to victims seeking to recover damages Then, after four hours of bickering, the committee postponed until Thursday any further action on what Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, called a `` complex and extremely controversial'' measure. The bill would establish a uniform federal standard of product liability that would pre-empt conflicting state laws. Consumer activists vigorously oppose the measure on the ground that it would weaken the legal rights of victims of unsafe consumer products. It was the first time that the House bill, first introduced in 1979, had advanced to the full committee. Even if it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, which is uncertain, the bill is virtually assured of a hostile reception in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it was filibustered to death in late 1986. Two consumer groups called it `` a radical bill that would immunize the manufacturers of defective goods, deprive victims of compensation for their injuries and expose American consumers to more hazardous products.'' Business support for the bill has become increasingly lukewarm with each revision aimed at meeting consumer demands. `` This is a watered-down bill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` but it is better than none.'' Other committee Republicans said the bill represented an important step toward discouraging `` frivolous'' damage suits, reversing the escalating cost of liability insurance premiums and bolstering the competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products on world markets. The committee's first day of debate focused on a compromise plan, drafted by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., at the request of Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., the panel's chairman, which was aimed at making the bill more acceptable to consumer groups and moderate committee Charging that `` we are about to emasculate the product liability system,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the legal grounds for damage suits in the states that would be pre-empted by a uniform federal standard. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> voted with opponents in defeating <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s pair of consumer-backed amendments by roll call votes of 29-12 and 30-12. Under the bill approved by <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s commerce subcommittee last December, a manufacturer could escape liability for damages if he did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect with knowledge `` reasonably available'' to him, or if there were no feasible alternative design. This restriction would not apply if the consumer could establish that the product was egregiously unsafe, that an ordinary consumer would not know of the product's risks and if the product had little or no usefulness. The <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been marketed. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> also would put the burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible. Leaders of four consumer organizations complained to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> on April 27 that <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s plan `` still falls far short of protecting the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably dangerous and defective products.'' Underscoring the bill's poor prospects, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., drew laughter at one point in the debate by referring to <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s plan as `` a killer amendment to a bill that's already dead.

<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says his department is now much less likely to be eliminated, and that he deserves the credit. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s boast came Tuesday during a typically contentious appearance before a congressional committee, replete with the taunts and tantrums that have marked almost every Capitol Hill exchange between lawmakers and the education secretary. One day after <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced plans to step down in mid-September, Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> accused him of having shirked his responsibilities to poor and handicapped students aided by federal programs. `` In the course of your tenure, you have chosen to go ahead and ravage these programs,'' said <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., referring to budget cuts sought on a nearly annual basis by the department `` Why did n't you concentrate on what was your responsibility?'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> asked. `` I have difficulty understanding your preoccupation with everybody else's business. ... I find it incredible that nothing has been achieved in your specific charges.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> defended his interest in state and local education efforts during what he termed probably his final appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on education and other agencies. `` The best federal program is the program that's deployed well at the local level,'' he sid. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came into office pledging to dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> conceded under questioning that he still does not see a real need for it, other than to spark debate. What, asked an irritated <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, would you think of teachers who see no real need for their jobs? `` They should n't be in a classroom,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> replied. `` Well, you should n't be in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> snapped. `` What kind of commitment does that show?'' `` I made a hell of a commitment. You just did n't like the direction,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> retorted. `` I was damn successful. You're mad at me because we were a lot more successful than you thought we'd be. In fact, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, he has done such a good job that the question of the department's future is probably moot. `` It's much less likely you'll see abolition of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in the future, largely because of me,'' he said. `` A lot of people think the department's been transformed.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> contended he had as much responsibility to lead `` an intense national conversation about education'' as to oversee federal programs. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the subcommittee chairman, has been highly critical of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> but defended the secretary's conception of his job When he voted in favor of creating the department, <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said, `` I hoped there would be a national spokesman ... I quite agree with you that that is your role.'' The administration has sought deep cuts in education spending for every fiscal year except 1985 and 1989 _ the years for which proposals were submitted during presidential election campaigns. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> repeatedly has lectured lawmakers about the need to restrain spending and told them more money does not necessarily produce better education. For their part, lawmakers have blasted <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> for consistently agreeing to cuts far deeper than those proposed for any other department. The result has been a continuing series of stormy, sarcastic sessions with various congressional panels, including the one Tuesday. `` Mr. Secretary, I know you're going to miss these lovefests,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> indicated later that lawmakers may not have seen the last of him. He said he would n't rule out returning to a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post _ even possibly education secretary _ in a future Republican administration.

<HEAD>House Approves Tougher Penalties for Contract Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A unanimously passed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would raise penalties against contractors convicted of defrauding the federal government, and its chief sponsor predicts the measure will stop a flood of such cases. `` Procurement fraud is robbing the government of hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and in some instances costing peoples' lives,'' chief sponsor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said following Tuesday's 419-0 vote The measure, which now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would apply to any procurement contract of $ 1 million or more in which the government was bilked out of at least $ 250,000. Procurement contracts are those providing a product rather than a service. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the bill would apply to some 10,000 existing contracts. The legislation would establish a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, and a minimum two-year sentence for cases involving a foreseeable and substantial risk of personal injury. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the risk could result from substitution of inferior products by contractors, especially in military parts. Current law permits fines based on the monetary gain to the defendant or the loss to the federal government. The House bill would add a new fine of up to $ 10 million in cases in which the risk of injury is involved. A reward system would permit payments of up to $ 250,000 from the criminal fines for information leading to a conviction. The measure also contains protection for government whistleblowers who provide information leading to convictions. Fraud in procurement contracts has involved overcharges, malfunctioning equipment and product substitution, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported in January that based on known cases, the estimated loss to the government in procurement fraud was $ 387.4 million in a one-year period ending March 31, 1986.

<TEXT>
 Post office window service and collections could be back to normal by the end of summer, but that wo n't mean the end of the agency's financial struggles, according to Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Tuesday that he is committed to restoring service that was cut earlier this year in the face of congressionally imposed budget restrictions. But reopening counters and restoring Sunday sorting and collection means finding $ 9 million a month in savings somewhere else, he said. With luck, he said, that can be accomplished by late summer. But he added that services will be restored only when he is sure that they can be kept open. Hundreds of construction projects for new postal facilities also were canceled or delayed to save money. `` Long after people forget about the windows being closed,'' building projects will still be delayed, land will have been sold to someone else and construction costs will be even higher, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who took over as postmaster on March 1, said that explaining the need for service cuts at the same time rates are rising has been difficult. The rate increases imposed on April 3 do n't help, he said, because the accounting system mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> results in the increased income being counted as a reduction in the national debt, not as extra money for the agency. On other topics, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said: _ A system may be considered in which notices would automatically be sent out for people filing change or address forms _ The agency should help serve as a go-between for other federal agencies and the public, such as by making catalogs of <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> booklets available in lobbies The current program to deliver an AIDS booklet to every home is a good example, he said. _ It is `` amazing'' how many suggestions for new stamps he receives He said he does n't see anything wrong with issuing a stamp to honor singer <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, although so far the independent committee that makes the final choices has turned down that idea. The budget problems may be eased by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that would remove the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from the federal budget. The agency had not been part of the budget until 1985. `` You really ca n't include us in the budget process, when we do n't use taxes,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. Direct subsidies to the agency were ended several years ago. In addition to restoring the services that were cut earlier, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he wants to find ways to add other services. For example, automated postal tellers now under development could be placed in shopping malls, more markets and other stores encouraged to sell stamps at their checkouts and automation improved to speed post office lobby service. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said battling for renewed public confidence means both improved service and improving perception of that service. He described a program in which postal carriers placed specific items in home mailboxes and, later, asked the residents to fill out forms indicating whether those items had been received. When the item was a large white envelope, only 0.3 percent reported that it had not been delivered, he said. But when it was a commercial catalog, 11 percent of the people who received it reported that it had not arrived. `` We know the items were delivered'' but the perceived value of the item makes a difference, he said.

 A representative of Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says the party must avoid `` simply listing the hopes of every group in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' in its 1988 platform. `` The document then becomes meaningless,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> after his appearance Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But while the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp was advising caution, a leader of the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign said the platform should call for tax increases on the rich. The 30-member platform committee, chaired by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, received its marching orders last month from party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who wants a streamlined platform that `` every Democratic candidate is going to be proud to stand upon'' _ not one that provides ammunition for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said the platform must be `` hard-hitting, progressive, future-oriented, idealistic, readable and inspiring. If our platform is going to be taken seriously, it must not hide in the mush of verbosity, buzz words or the easy promise.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, representing the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, exhorted the platform-writers not to make `` the mistake of a generalized, against-sin and for-motherhood platform.'' `` There comes a time when the rubber's got to hit the road,'' said <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s non-voting representative in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need to call for tax increases'' on the wealthy, for freezing military spending and for using pension funds to help rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who played a role in drafting the last three platforms, said the new one should `` help to unite all Democrats -LRB- and -RRB- bring us a resounding victory in November.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a co-chair of the committee, asked <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> representative, to provide the `` bottom-line principles that -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- feels must be in the platform.'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> promised to provide such a list. Lawmakers, lobbyists, mayors, labor and civil rights leaders urged the party not to gloss over specific commitments to women's issues, education spending, a tough stance on narcotics and other causes <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiehl </PERSON>, chair of a pro-abortion rights political action committee called Voters for Choice, said that with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposed to abortion, it is imperative for Democrats again to include `` a plank supporting reproductive freedom, including abortion funding'' for the poor. `` It has been suggested that our platform be a succinct, compelling statement of principles,'' she said. `` Let us be clear: it is n't the length of the document that will move people. ... It is the degree of commitment to those principles.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the leadoff witness, said: `` We've had a challenge from our chairman to keep it short, and ever since that time people have been running from the word ` short.' So we use other words: brief, concise, compact, terse, round and firm and fully packed and all those kinds of things.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the Democrats must articulate a vision for the future repudiating <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies that he said have brought `` downward mobility'' to families struggling to own homes or send children to college. The platform committee will hold a hearing Friday in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on defense and foreign policy. Other forums will be held on: families, in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on May 19; young Americans, on May 26 in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; jobs, on June 2 in both <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and new leaders, at a time and place to be determined. A 15-member drafting committee will huddle on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, June 9-13 to produce a draft. The full committee will take up the final document later in June, several weeks before the party convention opens in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on July 18. The convention delegates will pass judgment on the platform on July 19.

<TEXT>
 The life sentences and possibility of parole given a once-condemned killer for his role in killing six members of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family have left `` a lot of broken hearts'' in southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said one family member. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was sentenced Tuesday to six life prison terms after the jury that convicted him deliberated almost a week without voting the death sentence prosecutors won in his trial 14 years ago. By law, the life sentences were automatic because the jury could not agree. The 11 members of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family present when the sentence was announced broke into tears. `` We do know we had some friends on the jury and we certainly appreciate them,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, brother of two victims, who discovered their bodies. `` We had some enemies, too, and they're going to have to live with it. `` Everybody down here is just as sick as they can be. There are a lot of broken hearts in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, nephew of victims <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, were shot to death in <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>'s mobile home on May 14, 1973, after they walked in on a burglary. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, was repeatedly raped, then driven to a wooded area, where she was again raped, sodomized, shot and left to die on an ant hill. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> _ who had escaped from a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison camp _ were convicted in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> of the murders and sentenced to death. The convictions were overturned in 1985 by a federal appeals panel that said pretrial publicity influenced the original trial jury. `` It's been awful hard. We've been waiting for 15 years to see justice,'' said <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> and mother of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>. She said faith in God has sustained the family: `` He's going to be the judge.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was retried during the past several weeks in <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was convicted in <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> in January and again sentenced to die; <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> faces a retrial later this year in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is immediately eligible for parole review under a 1964 law requiring a review after seven years in prison, and will go before the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles next month, said board spokesman <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. But State Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> disagreed, saying <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is covered by a 1983 law that would require him to serve 30 years before a parole hearing. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the life sentences were justified. `` We can only assume that if <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> had had a fair trial 15 years ago, he would have gotten a life sentence,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is satisfied that his life has been spared,'' West said. Faded `` Remember the Aldays'' bumper stickers still can be found on a few cars in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a sparsely populated area where most people are farmers. They do n't like that their tax dollars have financed such a long judicial process, said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, who was not in court Tuesday. `` I think <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is tired of getting these people TVs and tennis rackets,'' he said. `` Without a doubt, these people, they do n't deserve a second chance. They've not shown a bit of remorse.'' <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> said the numerous appeals and lengthy debate in the case since the murders took place have placed a strain on the closeknit family, whose `` big family reunions and such'' have now `` gone by the wayside.'' `` Most people down here would like to move on and put this behind them, yet it'll be years to come before everybody down here can move on with their lives,'' <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> said. `` When your family's been wiped out, it's not easy to put it aside,'' he continued. `` It's been a long hard road for everybody down here.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> says a surge in produce imports intensifies concerns that foreign fruit and vegetables are arriving on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dinner tables with a pesticide residue. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> says he's also concerned that burgeoning imports may hurt domestic producers, who asked the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat for protective trade legislation at a hearing Tuesday. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on domestic marketing, consumer relations and nutrition. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> released a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study showing fruit imports more than tripled, $ 482 million to $ 1.6 billion, while vegetable imports more than doubled, from $ 783 million to $ 1.6 billion, between 1980 and 1986. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said those increases heighten concerns about consumer safety because the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement efforts are already weak. He cited a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study that found the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> tests less than 1 percent of all food shipments and uses laboratory methods that can detect only half the pesticides available on world markets. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bown </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, testified that the Chilean fruit and vegetable export industry `` is in conscientious compliance with -LRB- pesticide -RRB- regulations in force in all countries.'' `` Each exporter maintains strict control over the use and management of pesticides by each of his producers,'' <PERSON> Bown </PERSON> said. And <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berentsen </PERSON> _ of <LOCATION> Covemex </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.A. </LOCATION>, of <PERSON> Celaya </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a broccoli and cauliflower exporter _ said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> growers use the same pesticides and herbicides as their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts, and apply them in the same manner. Domestic growers saw it otherwise. `` We need to enforce pesticide regulations on imports, because right now they have an open door to anything they want to use and there is a lot of abuse going on,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NorCal-Crosetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Other witnesses representing growers testified the wave of imports could end up sqeezing them out of business and called for trade protection legislation The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found that the import shares for major fresh and frozen fruits rose from about 26 percent in 1980 to about 33 percent in 1986, and for major fresh vegetables, from about 5 percent to about 7 percent. The study said consumers benefited from the increase in greater supplies and variety, and in some instances, lower prices. Some producers and domestic processors have been hurt, while distributors and some processors benefited. But <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Garguilo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> testified: `` If nothing changes, we see more domestic production lost to foreign production.

 Activists <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, who've run afoul of the law in bucking the system, say they've also learned how to make a buck during their years as political gadflies. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, the antic activist who once offered a pig as a presidential candidate, says he's been cutting it up long enough to know how to work an audience as a comedian, rather than just as an advocate who uses humor. Banks, the former Indian activist, noted that something good has come of all his economic development work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. He and his wife have decided to open a limousine service there. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> speaks at more than 50 university campuses a year at $ 3,000 an appearance, but the 51-year-old former <PERSON> Yippie </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday for a comedy gig at the Coach House. `` This is n't new, this comedy stuff, because I was a bit of a stand-up comedian during the'60s,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who gained notoriety as one of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Seven defendants charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic national convention. `` The difference is that, in the'60s, they shot and threw bags of garbage at me, so this seems pretty tame by comparison,'' he said. Banks said recently he plans to open a limousine stall at the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> terminal and operate a shuttle between there and <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>. He also wants to add one or two 15-passenger vans to the business. Banks' <ORGANIZATION> Limousine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, `` specializing in your taste for the finer things in life,'' will offer free roses or a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne to customers. His market will include airport travelers, tourists who want a private ride through the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and Indian, and government officials who travel regularly between <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. `` I thought there was a market there because I had been experimenting with economic development in the past two or three years since I got out,'' said Banks, referring to his release from prison in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Banks, 56, became famous during the tumultuous days of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> activism, which peaked in 1973 during the occupation of Wounded Knee. He served about one year in prison in connection with the 1973 riot at the <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Iran's Growing Influence A Cause Of Recent Fighting In Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAQOURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s growing influence in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has made it a target for attack by rival Shiite Moslem militiamen and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army. Over the past year, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has mounted an ambitious program to finance religious centers, medical clinics and anti-Israeli guerrillas. Israeli officials estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is spending up to $ 100 million a year on such projects. The vehicle for planting the seeds of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolution has been the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which until recent weeks had been operating openly in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Officials of the rival militia Amal, which means <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, claim <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s influence has been eliminated in the south after a series of clashes. But analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have not been neutralized, only driven underground where they are harder to find. The Iranians remain in the south despite the recent destruction of their office in the port city of Tyre by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. An official with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer force who demanded anonymity said about 30 Iranian Revolutionary Guards are stationed in the south, providing military planning and intelligence for village-based <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which Israeli and foreign diplomats estimate can field 400 to 500 guerrillas, carried out more than half the 75 attacks on Israeli forces in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in April. Three Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen and six <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters were killed in April. The Iranians, who also have about 800 Revolutionary Guards based in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, stay in the background in the south but are closely involved in the planning and tactics of fighting, officials say. `` They never participate directly, but they do plan and control the attacks, providing the reconnaisance and drawing up the attack plans,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, the Israeli government's coordinator of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> policy, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> knew the Iranians had been `` tactically involved'' in the clashes in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION>, said in an interview that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was spending up to $ 100 million annually in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, much of it in the south, where more than 70 percent of the 300,000 residents are Shiite Moslems. Most of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 44 million people are Shiites, a minority sect within the Moslem world, where most faithful are Sunni Moslems. <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was investing in schools, mosques and training centers in a calculated policy of establishing long-term influence. `` They want to buy the souls of the new generation,'' <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON> said in his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office. `` It is amazing that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would have the gumption to do all these things and fight a war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the -LRB- Persian -RRB- Gulf.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has targeted <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> because the group has fired rockets into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and ambushed troops and allied militiamen in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The zone is a six-to-10-mile-wide strip north of the Israeli border. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also accuses <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of helping <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, who infiltrate from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Two Israeli soldiers were killed and six wounded in four such raids in April. Ten guerrillas also died. Such attacks made <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s base at <LOCATION> Maidoun </LOCATION> the target of a two-day <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> incursion last week in which 1,500 Israeli troops and allied militiamen drove out the gunmen. The battle claimed the lives of three Israelis and 40 guerrillas. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> reported four of its men missing and presumed captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said there were unconfirmed reports of Iranian advisers being present in <LOCATION> Maidoun </LOCATION>, a village in southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer said the attack, along with recent clashes with <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, had reduced <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s strength. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s power is much less. The situation is looking a lot better,'' said the observer, who is based at the headquarters of the 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in the town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Lebanese-Israeli </LOCATION> border. The diplomat said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s influence was apparent in the tactics of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters. Orders to carry out attacks are delivered by couriers to small groups of militiamen in a half-dozen villages, the diplomat said. The fighters rendezvous at a staging area where weapons are stockpiled, and are not aware of their targets until just before the operation begins. `` When it's over they go back to their villages, dressed in civilian clothes, without arms,'' the diplomat said. `` It makes them a very elusive enemy for anyone trying to find them.'' Starting in early April, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas also were targeted by Amal, which has the support of the vast majority of villages in the south. In recent clashes, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> drove <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters out of villages where they had established control, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and foreign diplomats say. <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> journalists in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said that in the past few days 175 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> supporters had been rounded up, and three pro-Iranian religious leaders had been expelled from the area. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which is directed by Iranian advisers and religious sheiks, seeks to create an Iranian-inspired <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in which Shiites dominate other religious sects. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> takes a more moderate line, supporting the traditional multi-community system. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s policy also is to limit carefully attacks against Israeli forces to the buffer zone and not to attack <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proper to avoid severe reprisals.

 The bodies of four members of a family were discovered in their home Tuesday night, and authorities believed the deaths were the result of murder-suicide. Police were called after a relative looked in a front window and saw two bodies on the floor. Police identified the victims as <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON>, 35; his wife, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>, 34; and their children, 7-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and 9-year-old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Committee Considers Immunity To Get North Diaries In Drug Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will consider granting <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> limited immunity to get him to turn over 2,848 pages of notes he took while a key White House operative in the Iran-Contra affair. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said such immunity is among the options the panel will consider as it seeks to wrap up its probe of connections between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels and Latin American drug trafficking Other possibilities include subpoenaing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and enlisting the help of executive branch agencies that should rightfully have the documents, say <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and his aides. At a hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> appeared on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s behalf and invoked his client's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to turn over the dozens of spiral-bound notebooks <PERSON> North </PERSON> compiled while running President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s covert Contra aid program. North, who retired this month as a Marine lieutenant colonel, did not appear. North is one of several targets in a broad conspiracy case that charges he illegally diverted profits from the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to aid the Contras. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded with an emphatic `` no'' when asked whether he had ruled out granting pardons to <PERSON> North </PERSON> and to his former national security adviser, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not elaborate, but his answer came a day after he told columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> it would be wrong to grant pardons before the trial is over, and suggested he would be out of office when that happens. Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward a pardon for <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, saying he did not think they were guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them. Portions of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s notebooks previously given to congressional investigators are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs, drug traffickers, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. But large segments _ committee aides said about half the contents _ have been blacked out by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> or by White House censors. `` It's the first time I ever heard of in history that an attorney who is not code-cleared, classified-cleared or even any security clearance whatsoever, sits as the custodian of documents that have been walked out of the workplace of the most highly sensitive government agency that we have,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, chairman of the panel's narcotics subcommittee. `` It's unheard of, and I think it's inappropriate,'' he said. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, in a closed-door meeting of the committee, presented an affidavit from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> acknowledging the subpoena for his notebooks but citing his constitutional right not to incriminate himself as justification for withholding them. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the committee will meet again soon to decide what to do next. It took 10 days for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> police to deliver the subpoena to <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Police who were outmanuevered by North at his <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home and elsewhere, finally threw the papers into his car last Saturday while the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was stopped at a traffic light near his house, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unnamed <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> sources. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he does not know what the notes might reveal of importance to his investigation, but believes his subcommittee must have the documents in order to be sure it has done a thorough job. He promised that if turned over, the documents would be kept secret. `` Why does the name of someone involved in narcotics appear in <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s notebook?'' he asked. `` These are unanswered questions that still tell me there is a lot that has not yet come to light.'' North, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member, directed much of the operation that sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and raised money to supply the Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred such aid. He and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> also have declined to provide the notebooks to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel who is prosecuting North and others on charges stemming from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> affair. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he has spoken to members of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff about the matter, and `` it's clear they do n't know as much as we do'' about the case.

<TEXT>
 The astrologer who advises first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that Southern Californians anxious about a four-centuries-old prophecy of a huge earthquake this month should stop worrying. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said the French seer <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> had incomplete data when he made his prediction in the 1500s. `` Centuries ago, the positions of Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> and all those planets were n't known,'' she said. `` He -LRB- Nostradamus -RRB- knew about <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> being where Saturn was. But he did n't know that Uranus was right there with it.'' She said she had predicted a big quake May 5 and had returned home Saturday from a month in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after it did not materialize and said she was confident any danger was past. Southern Californians have swamped earthquake information hotlines, left the region or taken other earthquake precautions in reaction to a vague prediction by <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> and a 1981 movie `` The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' now sold on videotape. The film, narrated by `` War of the Worlds'' prankster <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>, claimed <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> said the area would be wrecked by a huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is most likely this week. A slight quake did materialize in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION> early Tuesday, but there were no reports of damage. The earthquake hit at 5:32 a.m. with an estimated magnitude of 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a geophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, Colo. He said the epicenter was between <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>. Any quake under 3.5 on the scale is considered slight. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology was disclosed in a book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who said the first lady used astrological predictions to influence the president's schedule

<HEAD>Prescriptions, Premiums Dominate Conferee Concerns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees are getting down to the final rounds in their effort to resolve differences over a measure to protect the 31 million Medicare recipients against financial devastation from serious illness. After months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the full conference met for the first time publicly on Tuesday to discuss the first major expansion of the program in its 23-year history. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> both passed legislation on catastrophic health insurance by overwhelming margins last year. Although more encompassing and expensive, the legislation is built on a basic framework devised by <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> and embraced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. While no formal timetable was set, the conference committee is expected to shape a final bill for presentation to the two houses later this month with an eye toward having the legislation ready for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature next month. On Tuesday, both sides agreed on only two points: that major disagreements still separate them and that the time has come to resolve them. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that did preliminary work on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, cautioned against adopting a final version too expensive for the elderly to bear. He expressed particular concern about including the more expansive House version of a new prescription drug benefit. `` We can always expand these programs, but it is very hard to contract them,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. But Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., suggested a prescription drug program probably would be to the only additional benefit realized by millions of Americans who will not face a lengthy hospital stay `` They've got to see something out of this legislation,'' he said. The differences concern the level of additional protection the legislation will provide and how the costs are to be spread among the 31 million Medicare recipients who will have to pay for the Although the measures are substantially more expansive, and expensive, than proposed by the administration, The legislation does not provide long-term nursing home care under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ a complicated and even more expensive issue put off until next year _ but would shield <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries against annual out-of-pocket doctor and hospital bills. The cap would be $ 1,043 in the latest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> suggested compromise and $ 1,370 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise offer now on the bargaining table. Medicare now covers only the first 60 days of a hospital stay in a given year and pays only 80 percent of doctor bills, no matter how high they range. The major disagreement on the benefit side is over prescription drugs _ how much to pay and how soon to start paying. On the cost side, the major disagreement is how to distribute the additional premium <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees will have to pay _ particularly the so-called supplemental premium that is tantamount to an income tax increase for the estimated 50 percent of retirees who would be subject to it. The only other additional cost for the estimated 50 percent of the elderly not now subject to income tax would be a flat monthly premium of about $ 8 to $ 10 per month, depending on the shape of the final legislation.

<HEAD>Dukakis Supported Across Ideological Spectrum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> found broad ideological backing along with support from one-time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> primaries, both of which could provide important boosts in a general election campaign. Ideologically, `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a Rorschach test,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` Voters of different ideologies look at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and are seeing what they want to see. In a sense he's all ideologies to all voters.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit polls of voters Tuesday found that a majority of liberals, a majority of moderates and a plurality of conservatives said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views were `` just right'' as opposed to too liberal or too conservative. `` Certainly he has not been painted among these two electorates as a liberal,'' a likely Republican tactic, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. Instead, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed acceptable to voters across the spectrum of ideologies in his party. One reason for pause in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> suggested, was that about 30 percent of the voters said they were not sure of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ideology. But while that could suggest a lack of self-definition, it also could be turned into an advantage in a general election campaign, he said. Another good sign for November was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support from Democrats who voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984. Twenty-three percent of the Democratic voters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 22 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats; 73 percent of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 78 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could bring home the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. The finding has been consistent, he noted, since <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> started asking the question in its <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary exit poll March 29. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> on Tuesday scored one of his best showings of the primary season with white voters, winning 24 percent. He has done better only in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, where he <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had him winning 32 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who appealed to distressed farmers in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> for their votes, won majorities there in two issue groups _ voters who cited the poor and elderly as a key issue, and those who cited the ability to bring changes. Still, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won all white subgroups in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and won overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The key issue to the most voters in both states was job protection, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won a majority of that group. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made some inroads into the small bloc of black votes, winning 32 percent of the black vote in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 11 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Blacks made up 4 percent of the total in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 5 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and the margin of sampling error is high for such a small group in a poll. Among all voters, the error margin was 5 percentage points in the surveys.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hopes To Clinch Nomination In Next Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with two more primary wins, says he hopes to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in the final month of the primary season. `` I hope by the 8th of June we are at or closing in on the nomination,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The last round of Democratic primaries is June 7, and includes the big states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` I'm working hard, vigorously and I hope successfully, to see if we can wrap it up,'' the governor told reporters here Tuesday night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending most of today at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before heading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for a fundraiser. Despite his successes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where he scored landslide wins over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not writing off his remaining Democratic rival. `` We're taking none of these primaries for granted,'' he said of upcoming races. `` They're all very, very important.'' With primaries set next Tuesday in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and a week later in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, followed up by the primaries of June 7, `` It's going to be a very lively month,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also hold their primaries on the final day of the Democratic season. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, looking toward the fall, predicted he could be the `` unifier'' who would enable Democrats to put one of their own in the White House. `` I sense a greater desire on the part of rank and file Democrats and party leaders across the country to unify and come together,'' he said at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Marymount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we sense that victory is out there to be won and we've got one of the best chances we've had in years to win a presidential victory And I'm somebody who is a unifier.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says his recent string of victories `` reflects a desire on the part of the people of this country for ... very strong economic leadership, leadership that's committed to uniting this country and to building a very strong future of full employment and real opportunity for all of our citizens.'' `` That's what I stand for and I think that's why we're doing so well,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took a dig at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> even as he expressed a bit of sympathy over the flap created by the book written by former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. `` Like most people who've been in public life for a long time, I abhor kiss-and-tell staff people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Asked whether he believed the public had a right to know about <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reported reliance on astrology, the governor answered: `` I can only speak for my own first lady ... she appreciates the stars, but she does n't consult them.''

 A Boy Scout who crafted a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor puppet to feed the dying species' first captive-bred chick says he wo n't mind if the project does n't help him earn scouting's highest rank, Eagle Scout. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuckle </PERSON>, 17, of Vista, worked about 20 hours to make the 2-foot-long puppet, which has a fiberglass beak and skull covered by deerskin and painted to match the condor's distinctive red and black markings. Condor keepers at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> are using Schmuckle's puppet to feed <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, the 2-week-old chick that was the product of the first captive mating in the history of the critically endangered species. Schmuckle, a nature enthusiast who has ambitions of becoming a wood craftsman, said he began his puppet making in December when he was looking for a project to earn the Eagle Scout rank. `` I was going to do it whether they accept it as my Eagle Scout project or not. I like the condor,'' he said. `` I really enjoyed doing it. It makes me happy I could help the condor baby survive.'' The latest addition to the captive condor flock at the park was introduced last week to the hand puppet, which also is used to preen the chick as its parents would in the wild. The chick has increased its weight to just over 12 -LCB- ounces, up from the April 29 birth weight of 6 -RCB- ounces. A tiny bandage successfully corrected a leg development problem and has been removed, officials said Tuesday. Condor keepers say the puppet is crucial to the success of a breeding program to return the species to the wild. Only 28 birds are known to exist, all in captivity _ 15 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. The chick will be fed with the hand puppet until it is about 5 months old, when it will be released into the company of other juvenile birds, said condor keeper <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON>. `` It's very important,'' <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON> said of the puppet. `` The whole idea is we do n't want the birds to relate human beings to food. That would bring an identity crisis. ... The condor will think it's a human or think humans are condors `` Because of the breeding program, it is important that he, she, or it be able to socialize with other birds and not with humans. More importantly, when the birds are released out in the wild we do n't want them to be used to humans and fly in and be shot by hunters.'' Hand puppets were used in raising 13 condor chicks hatched from eggs taken from nests in the wild, he said. In the previous puppets, the skulls and beaks were made of fiberglass molded from castings of a real condor skull and beak at the Natural History Museum in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deerskin </PERSON> was cut, glued and painted to simulate featherless skin on the neck and head. Bands of black and white fake fur stand in for feathers at the bottom of the bird's neck. Eyes donated by a taxidermy shop were set in the skull. <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schmuckle </PERSON> improved on the former design, using a tougher deer hide and devising a better jaw hinge for the lower beak that made the puppet easier to manipulate. <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON> also praised the detailed painting of the deer skin to resemble a true condor's coloring. `` It's the closest thing to the real thing. It should do the job,'' Sterner said. <PERSON> Schmuckle </PERSON> completed a second puppet this week and is working on a third. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, he must log more than 150 hours on the project, supervise someone else during its execution and use only donated materials. The project also must benefit a non-profit organization. He has yet to submit documents of his project _ which officially benefits the non-profit <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> captive-condor breeding program _ to a local <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> board for consideration.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee with AIDS says he was fired despite a new federal policy touted as `` enlightened and compassionate'' that prohibits discrimination against government workers with the disease, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was fired from the department's <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on April 25, several weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> announced employees with acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be treated the same as those with other serious illnesses. `` The only reason they fired me is because I'm sick and because I have AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 30, who is undergoing experimental treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who lost his health insurance when he was fired, is appealing the dismissal. Federal guidelines on workers with AIDS were issued in March, when <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said, `` The federal government, as an enlightened and compassionate employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees, has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of the AIDS epidemic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was fired not because of his illness but because of the 30 days work he has missed since he was hired as a clerk-typist last July. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says most of the missed days were spent participating in the experimental <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> program. `` He's not being singled out,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Marman </PERSON>. `` He was discharged because he could not perform the job on a full-time basis adequately.'' <PERSON> Marman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was considered a probationary employee when he was hired, although both he and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s supervisor would not talk in detail about his case Diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex in October 1987, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said he took 10 days leave without pay on the advice of his supervisor and another 14 days to participate in the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> program.

<HEAD>Breeding With Overseas Livestock Could Lower U.S. Meat Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELTSVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exotic livestock breeds including Soviet sheep that reproduce much more quickly than American breeds could lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat prices if they were available here, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says. The American public should therefore demand that the government establish a program to gather and evaluate different breeds of livestock from abroad, said the official, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, part of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is in the public interest to have such a program,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is spending $ 26 million this year in an ongoing effort to gather, store and evaluate cultivated and wild plants so that breeders will have a kind of library of genetic traits to choose from in developing improved food crops, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. Such a program has never been developed to provide what can be thought of as `` gene banks'' for livestock breeders, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. The federal government should step in because commercial breeders have neither the capital nor the expertise to collect and evaluate exotic livestock species, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. He spoke at a press conference held in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s annual scientific symposium in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>. The department's efforts to conserve plant `` germplasm'' _ genetic material that can be used to regenerate plants _ has been criticized as inadequate. Department scientists agree that the plant germplasm collection and storage system should be expanded, but they say it is difficult to convince other government officials and the public of the need for additional funds. The Office of Management and Budget recently acted to hold next year's budget equal to the current $ 26 million, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shands </PERSON>, coordinator of the National Plant Germplasm System. Officials had hoped for an increase. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not developed the clientele to insure that these programs get the support they require,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, a sociologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> who specializes in agricultural issues. Of the various animals raised for meat in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> is the only one native to this country, and it was bred in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before becoming established here, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. He noted, for example, that <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON> sheep from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Finn sheep from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> reproduce much more quickly than traditional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breeds. `` Those are two sources of genes that might enable us to increase the breeding rate,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. A higher breeding rate means lower production costs, and ultimately lower costs for the consumer. The two breeds have their drawbacks _ they produce less wool and it is of lower quality, he said. Nevertheless, their genes could be useful in the development of improved breeds, he said. Bringing such animals into the country involves expensive quarantining procedures that can last years, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. In the case of sheep, for example, the animals must be kept in complete isolation for five years to be certain they do n't carry the scrapie virus, a potentially devastating disease. Only then can breeding experiments begin. Recent advances in biotechnology now allow sperm and embryos to be frozen, providing new means of storing genetic resources. Research also suggests that it might be possible to wash frozen embryos so that they are free of viruses, thus eliminating costly quarantines, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Accused of Withholding Critical Report on Alaskan Oil
Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says there has been environmental damage from oil drilling in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> but apparently nothing to scuttle an administration request to open the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to petroleum development, a congressional aide says. The report has been withheld from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, and the copies of the report have been made available only through unofficial channels, say aides to Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> water and power resources subcommittee considering the administration request to allow oil rigs in the nation's largest wildlife refuge In April 1987, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had requested a report from the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on the environmental impact of drilling in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s aides said Tuesday the report prepared by the service's Fairbanks office was completed and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last December but never sent to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Million </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday night he had not seen the report, but said he had been told `` that it was a regional report prepared in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and there were disagreements within the regional office on the conclusions reached in that report.'' Million said the report either has been or is being modified, but that he did n't know what conclusions the final version will draw. The report deals with existing drilling activities at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, about 70 miles west of the refuge, and the Trans-Alaska pipeline. The information from the report did not represent any `` smoking gun'' that could, by itself, torpedo the administration's request for permission to drill in the refuge, the aide said. `` What makes this such a big deal is they sat on it,'' said the aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Another aide commented: `` The real issue is whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is being told the whole story. They're not.'' The new report by the Fairbanks office supports some testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that populations of predators like bears and wolves have diminished since <PERSON> Prudhoe </PERSON> opened. The decline has been blamed on the arrival of an industrial complex and illegal hunting. But the document also said the caribou herd in the area has grown during development of <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> and that no major oil spills had occurred. The report said air pollution has been a problem at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION>, but said that dust has been more of a problem than chemical pollutants, the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> aides said. They added that the report cited pollution of fresh water because of drilling operations and alterations in natural fresh water flows because of construction. In testimony before congressional committees considering the future of the refuge, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> witnesses have acknowledged problems at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> with environmental protection and enforcement but they said <PERSON> Prudhoe </PERSON> has improved in recent years and those lessons would be applied to any drilling in the refuge. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s aides related that another section of the report said 22,500 birds were lost or displaced from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION>. The aides noted, however, that the report did not tell another side of the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> story: It has produced 5 billion barrels of oil and brought about $ 100 billion worth of economic benefits to the nation. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s subcommittee has tentatively scheduled another round of hearings on the refuge question for early next month. Bills to open the refuge have been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry have been pushing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the start of 1987 to allow development on the refuge, which they say may hold oil deposits to rival <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>'s and which could help alleviate the nation's growing dependence on imported oil

<HEAD>Major Initiatives Unlikely At June Economic Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the Oct. 19 stock market crash was a bracing `` tap on the shoulder'' but there is no cause for alarm about the world economy. The Economic Summit of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> major industrialized countries, to be held in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on June 19-21, is therefore likely to reaffirm current policies rather than adopt sweeping new initiatives, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told a group of foreign correspondents Tuesday. `` I would n't look for major new statements, major new decisions,'' he said. But in another pre-summit briefing, the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> took a much gloomier view of economic realities. The council's deputy chairman, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>, said failure to correct the `` fundamental disequilibrium in the world economy'' _ evidenced by continued huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits _ points toward another economic shock. He feared a `` hard landing'' in which interest rates will soar along with unemployment. `` We've gotten off relatively easy so far,'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said of the surprising resilience of major economies following the market crash. `` The question is whether between now and the election of a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the world can somehow muddle through. There remains a serious risk we may not.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must either raise taxes or slash spending to attack its deficits, but either course is unlikely in the final months of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. With that major problem untackled, <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said, the summit's `` scope is pretty limited. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> maintained that since the October crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> countries _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ have patched up differences and cooperated to stabilize markets. He also pointed to a clear shift in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy from consumption to exports, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have moved to increase imports to shave their trade surpluses. `` Inflationary pressures on a worldwide basis are n't there,'' he said, adding that the recent `` upward creep'' of interest rates should not derail Group of Seven policies. But senior forecaster <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> of the independently-run <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said: `` We're still lacking a true consensus about how to manage international economic policy.'' He said that since the mid-1970's, `` people have been resistant to face up to the fact that real growth has declined.'' With `` macroeconomic'' fiscal and monetary policies fixed, Canadian officials said the summit will likely focus on `` microeconomic'' structural factors such as tax reform, deregulation and privatization. Reform of land prices and the goods distribution system in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the extension of shopping hours in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and tax incentives to boost the level of bank savings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are examples of `` micro'' initiatives that could have a major impact, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambassador for multilateral trade negotiations, told reporters. She said summit leaders may discuss a proposal for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governs world trade, to monitor microeconomic factors in the same way the International Monetary Fund surveys macroeconomic policies. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he saw no need for changes in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s interest rate or other economic policies, despite the latest figures showing domestic growth stalled in January and February, after 3.9 percent real growth in the gross domestic product last year. `` We're still nicely on track and I see no reason to change,'' he said.

<HEAD>Indian Leaders Begin Talks With Sandinistas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan Indian rebel leaders, their support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shrinking, resumed peace talks with Sandinista government officials aimed at restoring some of their native rights. `` We have sought dialogue with the Sandinista government because our people are in a very difficult situation and because aid approved by the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has diminished,'' said <PERSON> Brooklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a leader of the Yatama organization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast Indians `` In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the government has closed our rearguard and has adopted a hostile attitude against our organization while the Americans say we are acting against our own interests and have cut aid,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, when talks resumed. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> began negotiating in February with Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, who heads a national commission on autonomy for the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. They failed to reach concrete agreements in a meeting in March `` but we delved deeper into the proposals'' made by both sides, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON>, which claims to have 2,000 guerrillas, has fought the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for regional autonomy along the coast. The Indians also resisted any exercise of authority over them by the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty which ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for 42 years until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1979. The Indian organization does not belong to the Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella group of the Contras, as the largest rebel group is known. The resistance is engaged in separate peace talks with the leftist government. <PERSON> Wicliffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, one of five <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON> directors, was suspended for forming an alliance with the resistance, said <PERSON> Stedman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagoth </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Yamata </LOCATION> leader. <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON> arose from the disintegration of <LOCATION> Misurasata </LOCATION>, an organization of Miskito, Sumo and <ORGANIZATION> Rama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. Factionalism has marked the Indian struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> since fighting began in 1981, when the government tried to impose authority on the isolated, traditionally independent coastal region. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> formerly viewed autonomy talks as `` counterrevolutionary,'' but said their attitude had changed. Still, the two sides differ over the definition of Indian self-rule. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> propose is decentralization of power, but through its representatives in the region,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` We want to elect our own authorities and organize the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> nation according to our customs and tradition,'' he added. `` We want our community borders to be as our grandfathers made them and not in a mechanical form.'' <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> with an autonomy proposal on Monday `` that is basic to talks for a permanent cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. The talks are due to end Thursday. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said a truce signed a week ago by a few <LOCATION> Yatama </LOCATION> leaders was not significant and was not authorized.

<HEAD>Caller: Contra Dissidents Demand Resignation Of Rebel Commanders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A telephone caller said 200 dissident Nicaraguan rebels have declared they will no longer take orders from the insurgents' military commander, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. The call to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reflected divisions among the U.S.-backed insurgents during stalemated negotiations between the rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist Sandinista government. It could not be determined if the caller, who did not identify himself, represented a substantial number of guerrillas opposed to <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. He said the dissidents also demanded the removal of eight other military leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the main 8,000-strong rebel force that fought the Nicaraguan government before a recent truce. Before he left <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> acknowledged to reporters that there had been a rebellion and hinted forceful action might be needed to end the mutiny, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. A Contra official in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday it was believed <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> would come to meet with the dissidents. The caller did not say where the dissidents were located, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday that up to 3,000 dissident rebels have been holed up at a Honduran base camp since Saturday. It said the camp is in <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, a tiny Honduran village three miles from the Nicaraguan border. There has been constant friction among Contras who served in the national guard of the late right-wing President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and groups who had fought to overthrow <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The Sandinistas gained power after defeating <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s national guard in a civil war that ended in July 1979. Many Somoza supporters fled into neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where they established military camps, and were later joined by Nicaraguans who said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had betrayed the revolution. Members of both groups formed the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> about eight years ago and began guerrilla operations inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The telephone caller said the dissidents were demanding the resignations of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and eight other rebel military commanders because: `` We disavow them as corrupt ... and assure the Nicaraguan people that we, the workers, campesinos and students who form the army of the resistance will not allow corrupt and dishonest people in our ranks who want to return to the past.'' The caller said the dissidents recognized the authority of rebel military leaders <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Membreno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Encarnacion </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tirzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valdivia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> were among seven Contra leaders expelled from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Friday after demanding that <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> resign. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan Resistance spokesman in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, declined comment on the telephone call. Earlier, he denied the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report that up to 3,000 Contras taking orders from <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Membreno </PERSON> had been holed up in a Honduran base camp since Saturday and were refusing to take orders from the resistance leadership. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said on Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> political and military representatives met on Sunday at a camp ner the Honduran-Nicaraguan border to try to resolve the disputes among the Contras. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> reportedly opposes the 60-day cease-fire agreement signed March 23 by <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> and government representatives. The pact calls for additional negotiations to make the truce permanent. The last peace talks ended April 30 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and no date or location has been set for another round.

<TEXT>
 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is using <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection beginning today, after relying for more than a year on local police on the presidential campaign trail. Campaign aides said the timing was the result of several considerations, including <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' increasing prominence near the end of what has become a two-man Democratic race with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said there have been no incidents or threats that prompted the change. However, he said, `` there comes a point in all of this when <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection is necessary, and in my judgment I've arrived at that point.'' In addition, aides said there was some concern inside the campaign about the potential for violence in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since the assassination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> after his victory in the 1968 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic primary.

<HEAD>Europeans Report Transplanting Parts Of Same Liver Into Different
Humans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's first two reported successful attempts to transplant parts of the same liver into different patients are big steps toward overcoming the chronic donor organ shortage, say transplant surgeons. Dr. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON>, a liver transplant surgeon at <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brousse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, reported here Tuesday that he had no choice but to divide the liver of a 40-year-old brain-dead man for two women, both unconscious and near death. The procedure, performed May 1, is believed to be the second in the world, according to Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. The previous one was performed in February in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` This is one way to increase the donors. If you have patients who are terribly ill and in equal need, it's one way out,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967. `` I can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we have the appropriate setting,'' <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. About 450 people are awaiting liver transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Transplantation. About half are children. In this month's transplant, the donor had been rushed to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and was a suitable match for either the 40 - or 54-year-old woman Unable to choose between the women, <ORGANIZATION> Bismuth </ORGANIZATION> transplanted half the liver into each patient. Because the liver is the only organ in the body that can regenerate itself, it grows naturally along with the body after being reduced in size. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON> told about 100 physicians from around the world gathered in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for a conference on liver disease that both of his patients' transplanted livers are functioning well. One of the women, however, is still critically ill because of kidney and lung complications she suffered before surgery. On Feb. 2, Dr. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hannover </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> performed a similar split-liver transplant <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said he, like <ORGANIZATION> Bismuth </ORGANIZATION>, was desperate to save two patients' lives even though just one liver was available. As a result, he split the liver of a 23-year-old man and transplanted half into a 2-year-old boy and the other half into a 63-year-old woman. Both recipients are back home and doing well, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> early today. `` I guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit higher. So I think it's a step forward, but it's only a step forward if one can not manage the donor problem,'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. `` It's an enormous need for livers in our country,'' he said. `` We have too few donors, so we have to take all the maneuvers to get more livers, particularly of course for the small children.'' In recent years, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> and other doctors in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have trimmed livers so the organs can fit into transplant patients, particularly children for whom donor organs are most scarce. `` It's of course a pity to throw away the other half of the liver,'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. Split liver transplants are more complicated than simply paring down the organ because doctors need to divide a common artery and bile duct, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. As a result, half the split organ is often weaker than the other. <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said the one-year success rate is about 50 percent to 60 percent for children who receive reduced-size livers, compared with 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ. The risk for split-liver transplants will likely be even greater and, until more is known, will remain a method of last resort, doctors said. `` Nevertheless, it's a big step,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said.

An official of a securities house, speaking anonymously, said there were no changes in fundamentals, however. Volume on the first section trade was estimated at 1.1 billion shares, down up from 700 million shares Tuesday. Losers included electricals, shipbuildings and machineries. Papers, chemicals, constructions and foodstuffs were also lower. Among the winners were steels and rubbers.

 A voodoo-practicing death-row inmate who wanted to die was denied a last meal of sacred earth, and gritted his teeth and mumbled when his execution was stayed less than six hours before it was to take place. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> won a reprieve from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday evening, after his mother filed an appeal claiming he was mentally incompetent. No vote among the justices was released. <PERSON> Alexzene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> also contended that mitigating evidence in his case was not allowed to be considered by jurors who sentenced <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to death. `` I'm praising God right now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said after hearing of the stay. `` That's all I can say, I just thank God.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, waiting in a holding cell next to the death chamber, gritted his teeth and said something inaudible upon hearing the news, said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. He was later transferred back to his death-row cell at the prison's <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> I unit. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, was convicted of the 1983 robbery-slaying of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance office manager <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>. Testimony at his trial showed he was tackled by witnesses while fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was linked to the slaying. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has no attorney and resisted attempts for legal help from capital punishment opponents. `` I do n't understand all this clinging to life,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Life is a temporary situation. The spirit moves on. Death is like eating a prune in the morning. It's a natural function.'' Tuesday morning, he requested `` Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final meal later in the day, a request prison officials did not honor. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M University soil experts said the dirt is believed to be eaten in voodoo rituals. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former tarot-card dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, has said he believes in and has practiced voodoo. `` I'm very disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>, the victim's brother `` He was caught red-handed. I do n't know what else they can do besides go ahead and take care of their obligation to get rid of the guy.'' `` Hopefully the judges will reconsider,'' <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON> said.

 Charges against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of genocide and repression of Tibetans were aired by congressmen even as a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> vice premier was meeting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials. The Congressional human rights caucus heard the accusations of abuses in Chinese-ruled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> during a hearing that, in an apparent coincidence, began at the same hour Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> was at the White House talking with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Reagan-Tiang meeting centered on trade, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not say whether human rights issues were raised. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said also said a meeting Tuesday between <PERSON> Tiang </PERSON> and Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> centered largely with economic matters. Reps. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., told the human rights panel they are introducing legislation for economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> linked to human rights abuses in the Himalayan region of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said his bill would ban <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of credit for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from international lending agencies and would provide for <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts in the Tibetan language and for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for Tibetan refugees and for preserving Tibetan culture. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> only as a part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not require its officials in the region to have a knowledge of the Tibetan language. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said that leaves the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` indirectly aiding and abetting in the extinction of Tibetan culture,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said. Actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tibet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has `` an ugly solution'' for the Tibetan problem providing for `` total annihilation of the Tibetan people as a race, as a culture ... probably within one generation.'' The 35 years since the entrance of Chinese forces into the Himalayan territory have brought `` one of the most devastating genocides we have had in history ... on the order of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'' under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, said <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., co-chairman of the caucus, said he hopes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration raises human rights with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders because the issue will not disappear `` The cost of human rights violations to the Chinese will be increased year after year after year until they realize it will be not only in the interest of the Tibetan people but of the Chinese themselves to put an end to those barbaric practices,'' he said.

 Glasnost and an afternoon tea with <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have led <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s to arrange the first modern international art auction in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s gavel falls at the July 7 auction in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet artists whose works were n't officially recognized three years ago will find themselves in the distinctly capitalist position of selling their work to the highest bidder. `` They all saw this as an opportunity to get international exposure, and were quite titillated to have their work auctioned by <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who will serve as auctioneer. In addition to 100 works by 29 living artists, 18 paintings by five artists from the Russian avant garde period of 1910-1940 will be on the block. With price estimates ranging from $ 3,500 to $ 35,000, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s expects the sale of contemporary art alone to total about $ 1 million `` Many of the artists, until a year or two ago, were ` unofficial' artists, who had difficulty exhibiting and exporting their work,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON>, who proposed the sale. `` This has all changed with glasnost.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> art dealer, said that with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, `` You can now step in and buy paintings. Before, everyone was in the smuggling business ... `` In many ways, this is a revolution going on here.'' The distinction between `` official'' and `` unofficial'' artists has faded and the auction virtually erases it, he said. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s was well positioned to be the first auction house to be allowed to set up at least for one auction in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON> had worked with Soviet cultural officials in his former capacity as curator of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, arranging exchanges with the Soviets. In August, at tea with Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he broached the subject of an auction. `` When I mentioned the possibility the first time, to my amazement, they were intrigued, and said it was worth exploring. There was a definite interest,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON> said he had a free hand in selecting the contemporary works for the auction, and he roamed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other cities, visiting studios and picking paintings. `` It's a very lively, vital group of artists whose works have been fought over by museums and collectors in the West,'' he said. For the artists, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said, `` The prices they may get are secondary to their desire to have their work seen in the West, to be known in the West.'' Soviet officials presented a list of avant-garde works that could be sold, and <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s selected from that. Highlights of the collection will be shown for five days in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> starting Saturday; then in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- May 22-24 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> -LRB- May 26-27 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> -LRB- May 31-June 3 -RRB-; and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> -LRB- June 9-15 -RRB-. Customers planning to attend the auction in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> can sign up for a special program of visits to the artists' studios, as well as lectures, museum tours and evening entertainment. Among the more established contemporary artists whose work will be sold are <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankilevsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The avant-garde section includes seven works by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodchenko </PERSON> and four by <PERSON> Varvara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanova </PERSON>. The most valuable on sale are <PERSON> Rodchenko </PERSON>'s `` Line,'' estimated to sell for about $ 200,000, and a gouache composition of his from 1916 which <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s thinks will fetch about $ 130,000. `` We will have to see how the sale goes,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON> said. `` It could possibly lead to other auctions _ this could be an annual event, or biannual.'' Nearly all of the contemporary artists represented in the auction live in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, though artists from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> also have their works up for sale.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company's claim to have isolated an elusive virus responsible for a type of blood transfusion disease called non-A, non-B hepatitis received a mixed greeting from a pair of government scientists. `` A number of researchers over the years have claimed to have found it -LRB- the virus -RRB-, but it has never been confirmed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, assistant director of blood disease research at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, a hepatitis specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the company's announcement `` is very important if it holds up, and the data looks like it will.'' Both scientists were responding to the announcement Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The biotechnology firm also announced its scientists are developing a test for the virus that can be used at blood banks. If the test proves successful, it could allow blood contaminated with the virus to be detected and thus prevent transmission of the disease through blood transfusions. The company said the finding eventually could lead to a vaccine to combat the disease. Non-A, Non-B hepatitis is known as `` transfusion'' hepatitis because it causes about 95 percent of the hepatitis that is associated with blood transfusions. About 3 million people a year are infected with the disease, but it often goes undiagnosed, said <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, because, unlike hepatitis A or B, it often does not cause jaundice. He said up to 2 percent of those who develop chronic cases of `` transfusion'' hepatitis develop serious, and often fatal, liver damage. <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> said he had not seen the <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> findings published in any scientific journal and was not aware of the company's discovery He said most such discoveries are not considered valid until they are confirmed in other labs, or examined by other experts prior to publication in a process called `` peer review.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> announcement said the research results would be published `` in the near future.'' The company also said it had not yet filed application with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for investigative research of its blood test kit, but plans to do so later this year. `` I think they have got it this time,'' <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` This is a first-rate group at a good company and they have been working on it for six years with very sophisticated molecular techniques.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> announced that the non-A, non-B virus was isolated by removing all of the genetic material from a chimpanzee blood sample that had a high level of the virus. The genetic material was then inserted into laboratory bacteria which, following instructions from the transplanted genes, produced proteins. Antibodies from the blood of hepatitis patients was then placed in the protein broth. These antibodies attached themselves to the proteins that originated from the non-A, non-B virus genes. The researchers then detected this attachment, indicating that the virus had been isolated.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, who won a battle for <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' first income tax only to lose the state's highest office after one term, has died at age 65. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, a lawyer and the state's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor from 1969 to 1973, died at <LOCATION> Northwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Tuesday, a day after he underwent emergency surgery for a massive heart attack. `` He always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to stand behind issues he believed in, such as the state's first income tax,'' said Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oglivie </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, and her husband were at the hospital when he died. Funeral plans were not announced. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>'s 1972 re-election loss to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was attributed in part to the 1969 enactment of the state's first income tax, which established a 2.5 percent tax rate for individuals and a 4 percent rate for corporations. `` He made very tough decisions. He did n't measure the political effect of them many times, and some of them hurt him,'' former Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Percy </PERSON>, R-Ill. said late Tuesday <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who edged <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> with 51 percent of the vote, is serving a seven-year federal prison sentence for bank fraud that occurred after he left office. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> took office a year after the 1968 riots at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In his final State of the State address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1973, <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> listed among his accomplishments the enactment of the tax, reorganization of the government and the curtailment of civil disorders. Among his failures, he said, were the inability to secure the enactment of merit selection of judges, and a lag in enforcement of anti-pollution rules for <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In recent years, <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> had become much sought-after in untangling complicated legal matters, including the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> bankruptcy proceedings, considered one of the most successful rail bankruptcy reorganizations. He was named trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under federal bankruptcy reorganization since April.

<HEAD>Another Yacht Seized As Ark Royal Leaves Key West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities released one luxury yacht seized under the `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy, but announced the seizure of a similar vessel also found with minuscule amounts of drugs on board. The 133-foot Ark Royal was released Tuesday afternoon after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company that owns the vessel, paid $ 1,600 in fines and fees and agreed not to hold the government responsible. The Ms. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>, a $ 600,000, 52-foot sportfishing boat owned by the Cigarette Racing Team of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was seized Monday as it returned from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and docked in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salerno </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents turned up cocaine residue on a dollar bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Neither person aboard the Ms. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> _ ship's captain <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON> and an unidentified first mate _ was charged with drug possession. Also seized under the policy last week was a 68-foot shrimper. Officials have not decided whether to pursue civil forfeiture of the boat or allow a fine to paid as in the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON>, assistant regional Customs supervisor. <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tomima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Rogerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the policy in a statement Tuesday by his office in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` This type of action presents an unreasonable danger to all boat owners for the isolated actions of passengers and crew,'' he said. `` The seizure of this vessel for the apparent individual actions of a crewmember against the stated policy of the corporation and the vessel for minute traces makes no sense.'' Under the policy, which went into effect April 15, vessels with drugs on board are seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ no matter how petty the drug offense, how valuable the boat, or if a shrimper's family depends on the living he makes from the boat. Civil libertarians say the policy puts punishment before the trial. `` What's wrong with it is the same thing that's wrong with shooting someone or hanging someone, and then saying, ` We're going to give you a trial to see if you're guilty,''' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, national legal director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> office, said it was obvious `` that the program is strict, stringent and tough. `` However, zero tolerance is also fair, reasonable and judicious,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` That has been pointed out by the release of the Ark Royal.'' Fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are ever returned to owners. The Ark Royal was in that minority because its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition, Customs officials said. The yacht's crew had undergone drug testing before being hired, said <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, who was not aboard the vessel when it was seized in international waters. And the government was unable to charge any of the six crew members with possession of the 10 marijuana seeds or two stems discovered by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> when it boarded the boat Saturday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> and his two crewmen were arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana when <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>' 68-foot shrimper returned a week ago Tuesday from an eight-day trip. The Miss <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> carried 1,750 pounds of shrimp _ and a few marijuana seeds the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> discovered during a routine safety check, authorities said. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> and his two crewmen said the marijuana was from a previous crew. `` What is a captain supposed to do? Frisk the crew and strip the passengers?'' asked Capt. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoszewski </PERSON>, one of the bitter fishermen who say their livelihoods and human rights are jeopardized by the policy. Several Key West boat captains have drafted forms for their crew to sign in which they swear they wo n't bring drugs aboard.

<TEXT>
 Two men extradited from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to face drug smuggling charges here said <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials supervise heroin production there and take a cut of the proceeds, according to court documents. The allegations, which name no specific officials but referred to a `` big official'' who was in charge of the `` upcountry province,'' were contained in affidavits requesting the extradition of <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Ah-Kai </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaiwisan </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The defendants are charged with shipping 70 pounds of heroin to an undercover agent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They were arrested in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in March and waived extradition. They arrived here Tuesday night and were to be arraigned today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said Tuesday the two claimed they needed permission from the communist ruled Laotian government to manufacture heroin and that officials received payments of approximately $ 2,000 for every 700 grams of heroin produced. In a secretly recorded conversation with an informant, the two said that Laotian officials also supervised the production to ensure they were not cheated, according to the affidavits. `` This is the first prosecutable case in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which actively discusses the possible involvement of Laotian government officials'' in drug trade, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. An official with the permanent <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> disputed the allegations. `` The government does not encourage the <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> people to grow or to produce or to trade in opium or heroin,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisouvong </PERSON>, a third secretary at the <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. He said the Southeast Asian government fully supported the elimination of illicit drug trafficking and was trying to encourage Laotians to grow crops like rice and vegetables. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> intelligence sources have reported that the production of opium, the base for heroin, had increased in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to more than 250 metric tons in 1987 from 50 metric tons in 1984, according to <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>. `` This type of growth ca n't go on without someone in the government knowing about it and approving it,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would have problems pursuing the matter because there was not much contact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wichai </PERSON> were believed to have been involved in the importation of heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for more than 20 years, according to <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. He said they received much of their supply in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The case began in January 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> learned that <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> was seeking a new route to smuggle heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Through a confidential informant in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> set up a series of negotiations with an undercover agent who posed as an organized crime figure with connections at Kennedy International Airport here. These negotiations resulted in the shipment from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> of 70 pounds of heroin, valued at $ 50 million, which arrived at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> on Jan. 16, concealed in a shipment of brass animal figures, authorities said. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wichai </PERSON> were charged in a three-count indictment, handed up Feb. 9, alleging conspiracy to import heroin and importation of heroin. They face up to life in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said the investigation abroad was continuing.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> opened an exhibition of his movies by telling an audience that films are a powerful way to bridge differences of opinion and that he supports glasnost in Soviet cinema. Glasnost, the Russian word for openness, is a key term in <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of reforms in certain areas. `` Obviously this is a very important time for our countries,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> told the audience at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Oktyabr theater on Tuesday, the exhibition's opening day. `` And I believe that film is a very powerful tool to translate differences of opinion and points of common interest. `` And for that reason, I support glasnost in both American film and Soviet cinema.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to meet May 29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, their second summit since last December, when the two signed a treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, 51, is most widely known among Soviets for his role in `` Three Days of the Condor,'' a 15-year-old spy movie that continues to be shown in Soviet theaters. He came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after spending three days in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> where the eight-film exhibition opened. `` The Milagro Beanfield War'' which <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> directed but in which he does not appear, and `` All the President's Men'' were the opening-night films, shown at two different theaters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lissakovsky </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION>, said the general public was being admitted to the films for 3 rubles a ticket -LRB- about $ 4.70 -RRB-, but that blocks of seats for each showing had been reserved for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lissakovsky </PERSON> said the money from ticket sales, which usually goes to the state, will be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for projects encouraging young artists. He said he did not know how many seats were available to the general public. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> said the Soviets told him the theater admitting the public will have three showings a day, making available 6,000 seats daily, with 1,500 reserved for Filmmaker Union members. The other theater is a private theater of the <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, with admission by invitation only. Other films to be shown are `` The Candidate,'' `` The Sting,'' `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' `` The Electric Horseman,'' `` <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' and `` The Natural.'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s stay in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which ends Friday, will include a meeting on ecology, a cause the actor-director has supported for years. He also plans to moderate a workshop on global warming caused by the depletion of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. The workshop is the effort of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> founded, and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> next travels to <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, to open the film exhibition Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Thin European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar held steady in thin trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this morning, with foreign exchange dealers saying they expected it to remain in a narrow range throughout the session. Gold prices rose. Traders said volume was modest ahead of the long weekend due to start for many dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Thursday. One trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said dealers might try to test the dollar's lower levels against the West German mark `` I see the dollar a little lower. But traders will try and move it down carefully,'' she said, citing fear of central bank intervention as the reason for their caution. Another trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said attention had shifted to sterling, following statements by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that he favors a closer link between sterling and the West German mark. The Milan dealer said he expects the pound to edge up against the mark. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 124.24 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.20 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday: -- 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6783 -- 1.3925 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955 -- 5.6915 French francs, up from 5.6905 -- 1.8789 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8815 -- 1,248.00 Italian lire, unchanged -- 1.2370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2375 The British pound rose to $ 1.8865 from $ 1.8825 on Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 450.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 446.50. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 449.35. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 449.20, up from $ 446.50 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Companies with 20 or more computer terminals would be required to provide employees with work breaks, eye care, special lighting and detachable keyboards, under a bill approved by the county <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. If <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> signs the bill, which passed 13-2 Tuesday, it would be the first law in the country to regulate the terminals in private businesses, workplace design experts said. Business leaders have sharply criticized the measure, charging it would be costly to implement and put placing them at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. They contend the bill will drive companies out of the county. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Pally </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the region's largest business organization, said the bill `` threatens the continued economic vitality of the community. `` We're obviously very disappointed and will urge Mr. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> to veto the bill,'' he said. The bill is intended to protect the health and safety of employees who use video display terminals -LRB- VDTs -RRB-, according to legislator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, sponsor of the bill. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, calling many offices `` high-tech sweatshops,'' said he believed there was a need for regulation. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, who must act on the bill within 60 days of its passage, said he would hold a public hearing before deciding whether to sign it. Lawmakers in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> county approved a similar bill last summer, but it was vetoed by the acting county executive at the time, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> A. Lo Grande. Labor unions, business leaders and workplace experts from around the country said the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> bill would serve as a model for other municipalities or states. `` Whether this bill will result in legislation elsewhere is unclear, but it'll rejuvenate a lot of campaigns for VDT standards around the country,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Legislator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, who abstained from voting, said, `` this legislation is doing what a union should be doing. Some companies hinted that they may consider areas outside of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> for future expansion. `` We view the law as a potential deterrent to doing business in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>. `` Undoubtedly the law would have to be taken into consideration as a factor in planning expansions.'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> has 1,500 employees in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> _ operators and office personnel who use VDTs routinely. Optometrist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallick </PERSON> testified at the hearing that many of his patients complain that they never needed glasses until they started working at VDTs. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> companies, however, argued that there is no evidence that the prolonged use of a VDT is harmful to the employee. It mandates that companies pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye exams and eyewear required for an operator and provide 15-minute work breaks every three hours for employees who work at the terminals. Businesses would be given six months from the bill's passage date to comply. If the employer does not comply with the regulations, the bill provides a basis for an employee to seek damages in court.

 The airline pilots union disputes the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s finding that pilot error caused the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that killed 156 people last August. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> in a report on the accident Tuesday faulted the captain and co-pilot of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 for failing to follow the proper checklist before takeoff and forgetting to extend the plane's flaps and slats, devices that help provide lift. The <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 crashed shortly after taking off from the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> airport Aug. 16, 1987, killing 154 people on board and two on the ground. The only survivor was a 4-year-old passenger, <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichan </PERSON>. The two pilots that were killed were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 40,000 commercial pilots. The union said it will continue its own investigation into the accident and hinted it may petition the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the government findings. `` The facts will eventually show that there's a gremlin running around in the MD-80,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> representative at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> was alluding to the contention by the pilots union all along that a mechanical failure could have prevented the flaps from being set properly. Even if the pilots forgot to set the flaps a warning device was the real culprit because it did n't warn the pilots of their error as it was designed to, the union says. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the `` overwhelming evidence'' was that the two pilots, Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maus </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and co-pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, forgot to set the flaps and slats because they did not properly follow a checklist of pre-flight duties while taxiing before takeoff. While acknowledging that the accident might have been averted if a warning alert had sounded, the safety board said the failure of the alarm because of an interruption in electrical power was only a contributing factor to the accident. `` The reason for the absence of electrical power could not be determined,'' the safety board said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has denied any problems with the circuit breaker and suggested the pilots may have pulled the breaker to keep the alarm from sounding needlessly. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said it could establish no evidence that the pilots interfered with the alarm system, nor find evidence of a mechanical malfunction. Nevertheless, the safety board called on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to begin an investigation to determine the reliability of such breakers and determine if failures within the system can cause such a power shortage. The thrust of the <ORGANIZATION> NSTB </ORGANIZATION>'s findings, however, was aimed at the performance of the two pilots. As the plane was taxiing, the captain failed to maintain discipline in the cockpit and did not go through the pre-flight checklists, a formal proceeding that requires the co-pilot to verbally acknowledge that each task is performed, the board said. There was no evidence on the cockpit voice recording that the flaps had been set nor that several other pre-flight tasks had been performed, the board said. It said that <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maus </PERSON> had last undergone formal training in cockpit resource management in 1983 when they attended a 3 -LCB- - hour training session The safety board called on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to speed up its development of guidance to airlines on instituting better training techniques on cockpit procedures and flight crew coordination While some airlines have such training programs, others do not, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. Among those who sat quietly in the audience at the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> proceeding was <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Maus </PERSON>, the widow of the captain who died in the crash. Mrs. <PERSON> Maus </PERSON> said she felt `` very badly'' about the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> findings `` because my husband was a good pilot and he knew it.'' `` I'm very proud of his ability and I feel that he's listening and I have to defend him,'' she said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister whose claim that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not the aggressor in World War II provoked strong protests from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other Asian nations told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese War began accidentally. The minister, <PERSON> Seisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>, told Japanese reporters on Tuesday that he does n't like to use the word `` invasion'' when discussing the Sino-Japanese War because both countries lost millions of people in the conflict. Japanese troops overran much of eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the war. Opposition parties have demanded the dismissal of the <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and called on the administration of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to take responsibility for his remarks. <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> has angered <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nations over the past month by saying _ most recently on Monday _ that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had no aggressive intent during World War II and had `` fought to protect itself at a time when the white race had turned <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into a colony.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s views had caused alarm worldwide. `` The repeated occurrence of such expressions ... in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... shows there are indeed some people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, even some people who are cabinet ministers, who have no intention at all for introspection of the past war of aggression,'' ministry spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said at a weekly briefing in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` This can not but alarm all the peace-loving peoples and countries in the world.'' Asked in Parliament today about <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said: `` Our country feels deep responsibility for the grave damage <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> inflicted on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people during the past war. We believe the government should fully recognize that our country's actions during the war have been criticized severely as aggression. But he stopped short of saying he agreed that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actions had been aggressive During a Diet -LRB- parliament -RRB- session today, <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> said he thought the 1937 <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> incident, generally believed to have caused the Sino-Japanese War, had occurred by accident. In comments last month that he reiterated Monday, <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should not let the views of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors stop <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members from visiting a controversial Shinto shrine that honors <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s war dead. Last month, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s statements `` astonishing and very regrettable.'' During a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last week, Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> reportedly sought to smooth Chinese irritations over the remarks. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Clean Government Party -RRB- began preparing a resolution calling for <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s dismissal Another opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, decided on Tuesday it would demand <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>'s dismissal, news reports said. In the 1937 incident at <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Japanese troops in the area under a 1901 protocol said they heard shots while on routine maneuvers nearby. After reportedly finding one soldier missing in a roll call, they began fighting Chinese troops who were guarding a nearby town. Several days later, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> poured more troops into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and hostilities increased. In recent years, <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries have frequently criticized Japanese views of its military past. In 1986, Education Minister <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujio </PERSON>, a member of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s Cabinet, was dismissed after saying <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was partly responsible for its annexation by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1910, and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in World War II were justifiable. The remarks brought strong protests from other Asian nations. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Asian neighbors also have complained about the government's approval of a school history textbook in 1986 that they said whitewashed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role during the war, and its censorship of other textbooks that portrayed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military role in a negative light. An official visit in 1985 by <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Yasukuni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s war dead are enshrined, also drew sharp criticism from countries such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which said it offended those who suffered in the war.

 Hail-spitting thunderstorms that pelted the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast for two days began blowing out to sea early today, while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helped enforce a curfew on a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town `` buried'' by a tornado blamed for one death. The storms, which shattered windows and downed power lines as far south as the Gulf coast and as far north as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, surprised motorists throughout the Deep South with icy roadways on Tuesday. `` We've got wrecks everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a police dispatcher in <LOCATION> Tallassee </LOCATION>, about 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. She said at least three people were injured in accidents during the afternoon storm The extent of the injuries was not immediately known. School officials in <LOCATION> Tallassee </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Wetumpka </LOCATION> delayed the dismissal of students Tuesday afternoon to allow the storm to clear, said <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. No funnel clouds were sighted despite tornado warnings. Thunderstorms also lashed <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where residents spotted several funnel clouds, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> before beginning to move out to sea early this morning, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, winds overturned three mobile homes, caused minor power outages and hurled a 50-foot communications tower 30 feet onto a nearby business. No injuries were reported. The storms produced golfball-sized hail near <LOCATION> Saucier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the wind gusted up to 76 mph. In <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, about 5,100 homes lost power due to the storm, but it was restored by 9:15 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> on Tuesday toured a 6-mile-long path of destruction left the night before by a tornado that killed a woman in a house trailer and injured at least 15 people in <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION>, a town of 11,000 just north of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> border. `` It just kind of hopped along the valley,'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said. `` And it's very obvious where it touched down.'' `` You just ca n't believe the kind of destruction we're talking here,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>. `` The city's just buried.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Iovine </PERSON>, who watched bulldozers clearing debris Tuesday from a furniture store owned by his family since 1910, said, `` It was wiped out in 30 seconds. I get to talking about it and it chokes me up. I've had it.'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said a preliminary survey showed that 38 businesses and 26 homes suffered major damage, but that damage was not severe enough to warrant a federal disaster area designation. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, estimating damage in the millions, declared an emergency shortly after midnight, and <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> activated 30 National Guardsmen to help clean up, keep the peace and enforce an 8 p.m. curfew in the damaged business district.

 The champagne flowed as family and friends celebrated the murder acquittals of reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and eight associates accused of killing a gangster rival. `` It was a very, very brave jury,'' said <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> at the party in a posh center city hotel hours after Tuesday's verdicts clearing <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and his associates of killing <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> on Sept. 14, l984. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and his associates were also found innocent of conspiracy and possession of an instrument of crime, charges brought against them by two ex-mobsters turned informants who said they were part of the murder plot. The revelers sipped $ 50-a-shot <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> cognac and downed glasses of $ 100-a-bottle Taittinger champagne to celebrate the stunning acquittal. The acquitted men, however, did not attend. They remained in jail without bail, under federal indictment with nine other Scrafo associates on charges of operating a criminal enterprise that includes murder, extortion, drug dealing, loan sharking and gambling. `` No jury in the world is going to accept that kind of perjured evidence without some kind of corroborating evidence, and in this case there was none,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said on the testimony of informants <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Tommy Del'' DelGiorno. That trial is expected to be held later this year and First Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the acquittals should n't affect his case, which uses the same charges the federal government has brought against organized crime families in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and other mob associates, including a few acquitted with him this time, are charged in two other murder cases still ahead _ one in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for the 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Frankie Flowers'' D ` <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON>, and the other the 1978 killing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> of former Judge <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfant </PERSON>. Last December, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was found innocent of federal drug racketeering charges, and the chief evidence against him and six associates came from <LOCATION> Caramandi </LOCATION> and DelGiorno. Others acquitted with <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> included his nephew and alleged mob underboss, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> `` Crazy <PERSON> Phil </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannarella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pungitore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scafidi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannece </PERSON>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> fled the City Hall courtroom avoiding reporters, but the office of District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> in a brief statement said `` we are obviously disappointed.'' `` I love the American judicial system,'' said <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, after the eight women and four men gave their verdict in the eighth week of the trial. He had been in court every day, with other relatives, giving visible support to his 59-year-old father, a cement contractor in <LOCATION> Atlanic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, whom federal and state organized crime investigators claim heads the <LOCATION> Philadelphia-Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mob decimated in the past decade by bloody internal warfare, arrests and convictions. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> has been in prison since his arrest in January 1987 for conspiring to extort $ 1 million from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> developer. He is serving a 15-year sentence for that federal crime.

<TEXT>
 A meeting between <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and prominent editors has made clear that a major gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members next month is expected to fall solidly in line behind his reform campaign. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the media and ideology leaders at a meeting at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that old methods of choosing delegates to party conferences would be scrapped for the meeting planned June 28, the first such gathering since 1941. The 5,000 people to take part should be chosen solely on the basis of their support for the reforms, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` There must be no more quotas, as were the case in the past, specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women are to be elected, among others,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The principal political directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to go to the conference.'' Others who spoke at the meeting appeared to endorse that approach and declared `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort to rebuild Soviet society, a path from which no one should stray. The 57-year-old party chief met with the media and ideology leaders on Saturday, but full reports on the exchange were released by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency only Tuesday night and early today. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained that conservatism continues to pose the biggest threat to his reforms and that the doubters have raised questions about whether the nation is turning away from socialism. `` Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these processes under way,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked. And the panic _ and this is very serious _ has taken the form of asking: ` Is n't perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and rejection of the values of socialism, is n't it giving rise to alien phenomena, is n't it destabilizing society? Yet the 57-year-old leader said not everyone who fears his reforms or has resisted them should be branded `` an opponent of perestroika.'' `` We found veritable confusion in the minds of many people _ workers, intellectuals and administrators alike,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` And let us be blunt, not only on the ground level, but also on the top.'' He did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans to bring about a more democratic society and stronger economy reached as high as the 13-man Politburo over which he presides. The Kremlin's No. 2 man, ideologist <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, is reputed to advocate a more conservative approach to resolving the nation's problems than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, although the extent of their differences is known to few outside the ruling Politburo. The June 28 party conference is expected to change the face of the party leadership and replace conservatives with more active supporters of perestroika. `` It is necessary to rid socialism of everythintg pseudosocialist, distorted and deformed in the period of the personality cult,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, referring to the influences of late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ruled the country for 29 years before his death in 1953. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for electing reformists to the party conference drew support from the editors and cultural leaders, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report. `` I would very much wish that the people who with their life and deeds have proved their commitment to perestroika by all means would get to the party conference and, on the contrary, that people who oppose it, who hamper its progress would not be present at the conference,'' said <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavrov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Prominent editors such as <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalygin </PERSON> of the journal Novy Mir -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptiev </PERSON> of the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the reforms themselves have introduced new problems and a lot of uncertainty. `` We should not think that those whom we describe as the mass of the people _ the intellectuals, the working class and the peasantry _ that all of them are delighted with perestroika,'' <PERSON> Zalygin </PERSON> said. But he criticized the party and media for at times being poor listeners and failing to heed public opinion. <PERSON> Laptiev </PERSON> also blamed the state-run press for some of the problems encountered in the reform effort, and as an example pointed to the media silence and distortion of events in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that ethnic Armenians want annexed to their republic.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> resigned today in a bid to form a new center-right coalition after an inconclusive parliamentary election called over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s nuclear-arms policy and its allegiance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Danish radio said <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> submitted his resignation to Queen <PERSON> Margrethe </PERSON> II at <LOCATION> Amalienborg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> and told her negotiations would begin this afternoon. Tuesday's balloting ended in a stalemate in which neither major bloc could form a majority government. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s outgoing minority, four-party coalition retained its 70 seats in the Folketing, the 179-member parliament. The socialist opposition dropped two seats for a total of 79. The opposition Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s largest party, touched off the election by pushing through parliament a new anti-nuclear resolution the government refused to implement because of strong objections from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The resolution, designed to bolster <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 1957 peacetime ban on nuclear arms, calls for notifying visiting warships that such weapons were not allowed in port. Unless the resolution is overturned by the new parliament, the government will have to carry it out, after the wording has been determined. Despite the vote, the government and the opposition both claimed the outcome vindicated their position on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issue. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, speaking during a televised post-election roundtable discussion with other party leaders Tuesday, claimed that the four coalition parties opposing the April 14 resolution came out best. `` The parties that voted for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> resolution on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy were weakened,'' he said. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, who had called the election just eight months after the last one, claimed the outcome would ease <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s crisis in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. He had wanted voters to endorse the country's `` full membership'' in the Western military alliance. But Social Democratic leader <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> insisted `` there was still a majority backing the resolution'' and said his party would work for its implementation in the new parliament. In reply, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> to negotiate with government parties `` a sensible solution'' to the issue. Until the opposition resolution was passed last month, successive governments assumed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies abided by <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear policy The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the new measure, if implemented, would jeopardize their plans to land troops in times of crisis to reinforce <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which controls the narrow access to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. They also said the measure threatened the solidarity of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and was against their own policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear arms. Final results showed 3,913,318 ballots cast for a turnout of 85.8 percent. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s Conservatives lost three seats, retaining 35. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON>'s Liberals, the senior coalition partner, won 22 seats, three more than it had before. The coalition's nine-seat <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and four-seat <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were unchanged. Capturing seven additional seats to total 16, far-right <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was the biggest winner. Shunned by the mainstream parties for its anti-immigration campaign, it is not expected to join a new non-socialist coalition. The Social Democrats stopped their slide from the past two elections by capturing 55 seats, a gain of one. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dropped from 27 to 24 seats, while the far-left <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Course </ORGANIZATION> failed to poll the 2 percent necessary for representation. The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one. Two semi-independent territories, the <LOCATION> Faeroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, each elect two representatives. A diplomat from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nuclear issue `` could n't come at a worse time.'' The election came the day before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to prepare for a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in two weeks. A perception that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is wavering in its support of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could strenghthen the Soviets' hand.

Despite being a rather young general, the <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> boy took to his duties like an old pro. He fired two blank rounds from an M-16 rifle, carefully retrieved the spent shells and stored them in his battle fatigues. `` I want to do it again,'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> said after trying some electronic rifle training. Each time <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> pulled the trigger and the electronic bullets hit their targets, he squealed in delight. `` He always enjoyed the GI <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> experience,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayhoff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s father. `` That was his dream, to eat with and take a nap with soldiers, take a ride in a jeep and see how they train.''

<HEAD>Exiled Soviet Theater Director Returns As Guest Of Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Theater director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> has returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after five years of exile that stemmed from his daring presentations at the <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> playhouse he founded. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefimovich </PERSON>, deputy director of the theater, confirmed that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday as the guest of <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yefimovich </PERSON> said on Tuesday he had no information about <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>'s plans. <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> and other theater officials did not return repeated telephone calls. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>, 70, became an Israeli citizen this year. He lives in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Katalin </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, but spends much of his time traveling. In July 1983 <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to stage his avant-garde version of <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON>'s `` Crime and Punishment.'' His family was given rare permission to accompany him and cultural figures speculated that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>, who had spent much of his career battling with Soviet censors, would not be allowed to return. The director extended his stay in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, demanding assurances that he would have artistic freedom if he returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In March 1984 he was dismissed from both the <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. When he left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>'s theater was working on a production of `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>,'' about the troubled eight-year reign of the czar who died in 1605. <PERSON> Yefimovich </PERSON> said early in April that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> intended to help the <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> company put the finishing touches on `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>'' and to take part in opening night in mid-May. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Yefimovich </PERSON> said the premiere now has been scheduled for June and <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>'s visit is purely social. Soviet media hinted last month that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> wanted to visit his homeland, but took no note of his arrival. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper, reported in March that <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> wished to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to work. It quoted him as praising Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of allowing freer artistic expression. In March 1987, <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> and other exiled scientists and artists wrote an open letter expressing doubts about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program and calling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a `` gravely sick country.'' It was printed by the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the writers were criticized severely in other official media, which accused them of wishing evil on their native land.

 Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said today the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could ratify the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the upcoming <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit if Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> works out disputes in talks this week with the Soviets. `` I think there's still time to get the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratification prior to the summit. But these matters have to be dealt with,'' the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders said this week consideration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty would be delayed indefinitely because of a dispute between the superpowers over verification of settlement accords. The dispute has almost dashed hopes the INF treaty would be ratified by the time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today for a long-planned meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that has taken on greater importance because of the verification issue. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said if the impasse is not resolved, the treaty could languish in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> well after the summit. `` Even though I ca n't visualize these matters not being worked out, it is possible,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` Unless they are worked out, I think we'll have a long delay and no ratification of the treaty anytime soon.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said that although the verification provisions under dispute are technical issues, enough Democrats and Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are concerned to keep the treaty on hold. `` It is a serious problem because on-site verification goes to the heart not just of this treaty, in terms of verifying, but also future treaties,'' he said. `` Frankly, the military significance of this treaty is marginal at best,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` But the symbolic and precedent kind of example here is very important, so we've got to clear these matters up.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also raised the possibility that the dispute over provisions signed by negotiators in December could reflect disagreements among Soviet officials. `` It may be that this is not the top leadership at all, but rather people who lost their points in the negotiation and now are trying to restore those points through obstruction in implementation,'' he said.

 The mayor of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> said today that the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> suspended him because he opposes whites-only beaches. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON>, who was elected mayor of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s third largest city last September, said he would rather be ousted from the party than retract his support for integration of the entire <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> beachfront. `` The policy of opening facilities must be pursued and I shall support it absolutely,'' <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> said in a statement. `` If this means my explusion from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then so be it.'' <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, is one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s two largest tourist destinations, and its <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> beachfront is lined with resort hotels. <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> branch of the party on Tuesday saying he was being suspended for disloyalty because he refused to endorse President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s policy on segregated beaches. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has supported the integration of some beaches but says other beaches should remain exclusively for whites. Durban's beaches reflect this policy _ most areas have been opened to all races but one prime section called <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> remains whites-only <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> said he formerly opposed integration of beaches but now felt this step was essential `` if we are to succeed in becoming a truly 21st century, cosmopolitan city.'' `` All beaches are the property of all people of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> in partnership with visitors from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other countries,'' he said. `` I am duty-bound to act in the interests of all the citizens of this fair city and I shall do so for as long as I am able.'' The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest white opposition party, won three parliamentary by-elections in March with a campaign platform opposing integrated beaches. <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> said he did not believe the issue was a key factor in the by-elections, which were held in districts far from the coast. Last week, a court in Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> ruled that the city council had acted without proper authority in 1966 when it proclaimed the local beaches segregated. The government promptly appealed the ruling and said the beaches would remain segregated until the appeal process was completed.

<TEXT>
 The widow of Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> is suing a small <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> publishing house to halt publication of a new book of short stories due out in September, her attorney said. `` The Uncollected Short Stories of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>'' is set to be published by <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, which is primarily known for importing British mystery novels. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> objects to the very cavalier treatment she has been given by this publishing company and the cavalier treatment to Mr. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>'s work,'' her attorney, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbus </PERSON>, said Tuesday. The suit will seek to have the contract with <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> declared invalid because the publisher failed to consult Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> about the book's content as promised, <PERSON> Garbus </PERSON> said. He said the suit would likely be filed by week's end in either federal or state court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> particularly objected to a forward by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, professor of literature at the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and author of a Cheever biography to be published in June by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> said <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> was wrong to say that her husband's early works were left out because he `` repudiated his apprenticeship and formative years. She said <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> did not want them used in a 1978 collection and would not want them used now because they were `` embarrassingly immature.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> also objects to <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s interpretation that <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>'s works were a personal history. The 550-page Academy book collects 68 Cheever stories written for magazines between 1931 and 1981. Academy has already brought the matter before the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to have the contract declared valid. The company wants the court to enjoin Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>'s from interfering with publication. The author, who published his first short story when he was 17, died in July 1982 at age 70. He won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for `` The Stories of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>,'' a collection of short fiction works. Other <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> works include `` The Wapshot Chronicle'' and `` Falconer.''

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> appointed a longtime aide as his chief of staff today and consulted with senior Socialists on choosing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers in his new government. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, re-elected on Sunday, appointed <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on Tuesday to succeed conservative <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, long a rival to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> within the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not delay naming his Cabinet ministers, but it was not clear how soon the appointments would come. The first move by the 57-year-old premier was to name <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchon </PERSON> his chief of staff. <PERSON> Huchon </PERSON> was chief of staff to <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> when he was planning minister, then agriculture minister, in Socialist governments from 1981-85. He is first deputy mayor of Conflans St. <PERSON> Honorine </PERSON>, the working-class town in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburbs where <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has been mayor since 1977. It is common in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for senior national officials to keep their mayoral posts. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who was premier for two years, has been mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for more than a decade. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, was re-elected to a seven-year term in a landslide victory over <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> on Sunday. But the success of a new government will depend largely on whether the Socialists gain the confidence of a broad spectrum of voters _ and backing from centrist politicans. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s center-right coalition still controls the 577-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, marking the first time in the 30 years of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fifth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> that a government must face a hostile <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Commentary on <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s appointment was largely favorable in French newspapers, even those that traditionally support rightist policies. The conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> noted that <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> favored a free-market economy and said he had `` shown his independent spirit'' by bucking official Socialist positions in the past. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, a prominent centrist member of the assembly, said on Tuesday that he was `` waiting for a gesture toward a united <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' in the composition of <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s Cabinet <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, 57, told reporters Tuesday that he would keep in mind <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people's concerns `` for their future, for their jobs, for their education, for their security.'' He must assemble a government which reflects the Socialists' swing to the center and which can try to work with the conservative parliamentary majority <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> says he will not automatically dissolve the assembly to try to gain a leftist majority, choosing to try for success with the present system. He also says the new government will include non-Socialists. The new government is expected to profit from an increasingly divided right wing, ranging from centrists to ultraright. Presenting himself as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s `` unifier,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> wooed over some centrist politicians upset with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s attempt to accommodate the growing far-right movement. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a self-described `` free enterprise leftist,'' was prepared to run for the presidency this year until <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> declared his candidacy. Polls usually rate him as one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most popular politicans. A non-doctrinaire Socialist, he symbolizes the president's effort for a policy of `` enlargement'' beyond the Socialist ranks. The debonair, 5-foot-7 <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> is known for his independent and outspoken views. He resigned as agriculture minister in 1985 because he objected to a new system of proportional voting instituted by the Socialists. The president bucked pressure in affirming that he will not immediately dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, in which the Socialists hold 211 seats. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is being urged to take advantage of the victory momentum and move quickly with changes. The president, stressing the new political configuration, has made few concrete proposals for change. One of the few significant programs <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> says he intends to pursue is re-establishing the Socialist wealth tax abolished by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in 1986. He wants the proceeds to fund a minimum guaranteed income. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also says he will not continue the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> government's privatization of state-owned companies.

<BYLINE>Heart Transplant Recipients Risk Mood Troubles, Family Distress,
Study Says

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study of heart transplant recipients has found that half suffered mood disturbances after the operation and many faced family problems related to the surgery and recovery. The results indicate psychiatrists must work to help recipients get the most out of life after transplants, researchers said Tuesday. Side effects of post-transplant medications cause some of the psychological problems, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He and colleague <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornfeld </PERSON> did the work, which <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a very important paper. It's really pace-setting and pace-making,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>, an authority on psychiatric aspects of transplants. The research was done with two groups of recipients. One group of 30 was interviewed at up to a year after surgery, while another 43 were studied up to six years after the transplant. Overall, 37 of the 73 recipients had experienced some kind of mood disturbances following the surgery. Problems ranged from demoralization and difficulty adjusting to post-transplant life to four cases of major depression. Fifteen of the 37 patients reported a period of mood swings, irritability and argumentativeness, often with some mild mania. Symptoms began in the first few weeks after transplantation and gradually receded as dosages of drugs to prevent organ rejection were tapered off. Twenty-two patients reported sexual problems as a side effect of anti-rejection drugs. Twelve patients said they had experienced family or marital troubles, such as children running away from home or picking fights with their parents. The second problem was especially common with teenage sons who resented the father's trying to re-assert a role of disciplinarian now that the disabling heart condition was over, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. Some problems result from the use of the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine, which is inconvenient to administer and accompanied by such side effects as headache, burning pains and interference with sexual performance, researchers said in a written version of the report. `` Impotence and fearful avoidance of sexual intercourse lead many patients to feel guilt and disappointment, which is expressed in fighting or creating psychological distance from the partner,'' they said. `` These problems tend to work out over the course of 12 to 18 months.'' Sixteen patients also complained of decreased memory.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Claims Violations In Burma</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Burmese soldiers have killed, raped and tortured members of ethnic minorities in the government's fight to crush rebel movements, the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. The London-based organization said evidence shows `` a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmese army. In a 71-page report, it described the fates of nearly 200 alleged victims. Among cases listed were those of an 11-year-old girl and her mother raped by soldiers, a 22-year-old student who may have been shot `` because he looked different'' and an illiterate rice farmer whose flesh was peeled from the bone during interrogation. An appendix gave details of apparent `` extrajudicial executions'' of 60 members of the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> minority. Only one was said to have been an active rebel. The Amnesty report said insurgents also have killed civilians, but said the government was not justified in doing the same. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> investigates human rights violations around the world. It said the information on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> came from civilians of the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, Mon and <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> ethnic groups who fled the country and were interviewed in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> last November. Its report noted that human rights investigators have not been allowed into <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in February denying similar allegations. Officials in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital, said they had no knowledge of the allegations. Burmese officials almost never make statements to journalists on sensitive questions. Gen. <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>'s military government has ruled the country for 26 years, espousing a mix of socialism and Buddhism. In the last several years, his army has expanded its campaign against insurgents of the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, Mon, <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> and other minorities who control large areas along the frontiers, especially in the north and west. Amnesty's report said insurgents had bombed schools, markets and other civilian targets, but it gave no details. Rebel groups have denied involvement in some of those attacks. `` Killings or other crimes by opposition groups can never be used to justify unlawful killings or torture by members of the security forces,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. `` The security forces are entrusted with protecting citizens and upholding and defending the legal system. Torture described by those interviewed included burning with cigars, slashing with knives, near-strangulation and `` shin rolling'' _ rolling large bamboo poles over the shins until the skin peels off and bones are exposed. Villagers forced to work as porters or guides for the army have been beaten to death or forced to walk through minefields ahead of soldiers, the report said. Burmese law provides normal channels for the arrest and prosecution of those suspected of rebellion, as well as human rights safeguards, `` yet virtually none of the refugees interviewed knew of any instance in which this legislation had been invoked,'' it said. A 22-year-old victim's brother told Amnesty investigators: `` They could easily have taken him away for questioning, but instead they simply killed him. `` My brother had been to school for eight years. He was tidy and well-dressed. He had a fancy haircut. I think that maybe they shot him because he looked different.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent report that `` the serious human rights problems which persist in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> are the result of an authoritarian government and ruling party which do not guarantee basic rights or the application of an impartial rule of law.''

 Officials will seek an immediate review of drug and alcohol testing practices on local railways following the discovery that five employees involved in a fatal commuter train crash last month had used drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> released test results Tuesday showing that an engineer killed in the April 6 <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> train crash had marijuana in his system, and that a dispatcher's urine contained morphine and codeine `` This insanity has got to stop,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>, said. Discovery of the drug traces also prompted <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> to reissue his call for random testing of rail workers. In the last 16 months, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> noted, there has been a rail accident every 10 days somewhere in the nation in which at least one employee tested positive for drugs. The dead or injured in these accidents number 370, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> called for an immediate review of testing practices at <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> and the city's <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> serves <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north of the city, and <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> crash, morphine traces found in dispatcher <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>'s urine were `` comparable to those which could be expected following heroin use,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Brott </PERSON>, an FRA spokesman. Engineer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was killed when his empty train slammed into the rear of another empty commuter train. He tested positive for marijuana in his urine and his blood, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> officials have blamed <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 42, for failing to activate an automatic safety system that could have prevented the collision. They also said the train appeared to be traveling well over the 15 mph speed limit. Three other railroad employees who controlled train movements also had controlled substances in their systems, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said. The three, who worked at a station near the crash site, have been absolved of responsibility for the crash, according to <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Along with <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>, who worked in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, they were suspended after the accident and now face disciplinary hearings. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> employees found to have used drugs on the job must enter a substance abuse program or face dismissal. They also are subject to spot drug testing while in the program. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> declined to say whether the tests indicated drugs might have affected the men's performances. A final report on the accident, to be released in about two months, will determine what role drug use played in the crash, he said. The tests, he said, did not indicate how recently the workers might have used the drugs.

 A jury took only seven hours to weigh 500 pieces of evidence and testimony from 91 witnesses, then found a man guilty of killing five hikers in a series of `` trailside slayings'' that terrorized <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> parks. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that convicted <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> on Tuesday will return next week to begin for the penalty phase to determine whether the he should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was convicted of first-degree murder with special circumstances in the 1980 killings of five hikers in two <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> parks, part of a series of crimes dubbed the `` trailside slayings'' eight years ago. After four months of hearing evidence, the jury returned the verdict against <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> at the end of its second day of deliberations. Attorneys on both sides were surprised by the quick decision. `` It certainly seems to suggest they did n't buy anything the defense presented,'' said <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> in closing arguments as a cold-blooded killer whose `` ultimate goal'' was to commit murder and rape and get away with it. `` We were much more hopeful than this,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. `` It came as a surprise to have an unfavorable verdict as fast as this.'' Defense attorneys argued <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> deserved acquittal because of `` serious doubts'' created by what they termed questionable police procedures and inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, who already has been sentenced to the gas chamber for two related killings in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> parks, sat expressionless as Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> read the verdict. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> spent eight days on the stand testifying in his own defense, alleging he was miles away from the murder sites on the days of the killings at <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamalpais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. He was convicted of murdering <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowers </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreland </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Cotati </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Shauna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> was also convicted of raping two of his Marin victims and trying to rape a third. Defense attorneys said they would spend the rest of the week developing a strategy for the penalty hearing scheduled to begin Tuesday. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s automatic appeal in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> case is pending before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s highest court upheld the convictions and prison sentences of seven Palestinians who conceived and carried out the 1985 hijacking of the <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> cruise ship. After a three-hour hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cassation </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rejected appeals by defendants, including fugitive <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. The court thus let stand the May 23, 1987, convictions and sentences decided by an appeals court in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, the port city where the ill-fated <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> cruise began. An elderly, wheelchair-bound <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>, was shot to death and his body was thrown into the sea during the ordeal. Tuesday's ruling cleared the way for a separate civil action by relatives of <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> to seek damages. Earlier rulings said the two daughters of <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> were entitled to compensation. In addition to <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the Court of Cassation upheld life sentences for two other fugitive group leaders: <PERSON> Ozzuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Badrakkam </PERSON>, described as military chief; and <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, another organization official. The 7-year term of <PERSON> Abdulrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, a colonel in the front, was also upheld. They were accused of helping to organize the hijacking. Three hijackers covered by the Cassation ruling are in Italian custody. They include <PERSON> Magied </PERSON> <PERSON> Molqi </PERSON>, leader of the hijackers and described as the man who shot <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>, sentenced to 30 years; and two other hijackers, <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatayer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelatif </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Assadi </PERSON>, sentenced to nearly 25 years and nearly 16 years. <PERSON> Assadi </PERSON> had cooperated with investigators. A fourth hijacker, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Asker </PERSON>, was convicted in separate trials in juvenile court because he was a minor at the time of the crime. The commandeered <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> eventually docked at an <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> port, where passengers and hijackers got off after officials negotiated with the pirates. Italian police took custody of the four hijackers after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes intercepted the Egyptian plane that was taking them to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and forced the aircraft to land in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. Also aboard the plane were <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Badrakkam </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> officials later released them despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protests, saying there was no evidence to hold them. Prosecutors later indicted them for trial.

 A new study suggests that eating beef may not be as bad for the heart as experts had once assumed because one of its major forms of saturated fat lowers cholesterol. Despite their findings, however, the study's authors recommended that people stick to widely accepted dietary guidelines and keep their fat intake as low as possible. The study, conducted by Drs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanome </PERSON>, found that stearic acid, one of the main components of saturated fat in the diet, appears to lower the body's cholesterol levels. Until now, many experts assumed that all kinds of saturated fat, including those containing stearic acid, were bad for the heart because they promote clogging deposits of cholesterol. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said that if people eat moderate portions of lean beef, `` it should not be feared as a cholesterol-raising food.'' The research, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was scheduled to be published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. In an accompanying editorial, Drs. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aging at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> praised the work. They said it `` demonstrates convincingly'' that a diet high in stearic acid does not raise blood cholesterol. But they were also cautious in interpreting the findings, concluding, `` This study should not change our chief dietary message to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Beef contains two major forms of saturated fat _ stearic acid and palmitic acid. And while stearic acid lowers cholesterol, palmitic acid raises it significantly. Stearic acid is found in varying amounts in many other foods, too, including chicken and vegetables. Saturated fats are hard at room temperature, while polyunsaturated and monosaturated fats, which come largely from vegetables, are liquid. The researchers said the food industry may be able to use stearic acid to make margarine that is more like butter, as well as a cholesterol-lowering form of shortening for cooking. The study was based on 11 men who consumed three liquid diets that were high in either stearic acid, palmitic acid or oleic acid, a monosaturated fat that also lowers cholesterol.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, wanted in connection with the slayings of 12 people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, has won a five-month delay in his Canadian extradition hearing. On Tuesday, a judge in the <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION>'s Bench granted the delay until Oct. 17 at the request of defense lawyer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, a 27-year-old former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marine, listened intently to three hours of procedural arguments but displayed no emotion. Dressed in blue jeans and a plaid shirt, he was shackled at the wrists and ankles. A dozen police officers provided tight security, reporters and spectators were checked with metal detectors and a police dog was at the courtroom entrance. Ng faces 25 criminal charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 12 of capital murder. Eleven of the homicide charges involve 1985 sex-torture killings at a rural cabin in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The other concerns the 1984 slaying of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiletti </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities applied for <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s extradition in February 1987. His lawyers have said they will fight his return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unless they are convinced he wo n't face the death penalty in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> if convicted. When the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> banned capital punishment in 1976, the government signed an extradition treaty which allows it to refuse to extradite fugitives who may face the death penalty in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, the federal justice minister can waive that right. <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> is serving a 4 -LCB- - year sentence at the federal penitentiary in Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, for armed robbery, aggravated assault and unlawful use of a firearm He was convicted in December 1985 after a shoplifting attempt at a <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> department store during which <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> shot a security guard in the hand.

 Former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> today urged likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to use President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic record as his platform in the race for the presidency. `` I certainly make the case for Reaganomics and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record in my book,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' show, referring to his recently-released memoir, `` For the Record.'' `` And if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chooses to run on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record, I think he'll be running on a very strong platform.'' The vice president has a mathematical lock on the nomination and is expected to pick up <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement later today. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, whose behind-the-scenes book has angered the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for its descriptions of a disengaged president influenced by a first lady motivated by astrology, said he often failed to get <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to focus on critical economic issues. As <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he was `` flying by the seat of my pants.'' `` The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and reading the newspapers,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> writes. While crediting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with creating `` an atmosphere of confidence,'' that helped in the recovery from 1981-82 recession, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said, `` the president himself had very little to do with the invention and the implementation of the policies'' that came to be called `` Reaganomics.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said today that Reaganomics deserves high marks. `` I think Reaganomics has proven successful. We've had 5 -LCB- years of expansion ... and the possibility of more months to come in that,'' he said. `` We've had a change in morale in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people over the last few years. Remember that ... the malaise and all that sort of thing, that's what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inherited and yet as he leaves office we feel a lot better about ourselves.

 A judge, ignoring a plea for mercy by the victim's widow, sentenced two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Billionaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to life in prison without parole for murdering one defendant's father. Sentenced Tuesday were <PERSON> Arben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON>, the 26-year-old son of <PERSON> Hedayat </PERSON> <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON>, who was kidnapped and suffocated in a steamer trunk in July 1984. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dosti </PERSON>, 26, despite <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON>'s mothers' plea for leniency. `` I believe <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> is innocent,'' <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakimi </PERSON>, widow of the victim, told the judge in broken English. The elder <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> had at one time been an adviser to the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Your crime involved a great deal of thought, planning and execution,'' the judge said. `` For that reason, I'm sentencing you to life without possibility of parole.'' <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, said his client was not present during the kidnapping or death of his father and was only involved in conspiracy to kidnap. Assistant state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> noted that the jury had found <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> guilty of murder after a trial of about 50 days. The two were convicted in January of murder, kidnapping for extortion and conspiracy in the plot to kidnap the elder <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> for ransom, then kill him. The victim suffocated, apparently accidentally, inside the steamer trunk hours after being kidnapped from his condominium in July 1984. Authorities had originally suspected that the elder <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON>, a former Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member under the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, had been killed by a hit squad sent by the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> revolutionary government that deposed the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> in 1979. <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> was active in the movement against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dosti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eslaminia </PERSON> were members of the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in 1983 as a business fraternity of bright young men from some of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s wealthiest families. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 27, was sentenced last July 6 to life in prison without parole in the slaying of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who vanished in the summer of 1984 and whose body was never found.

<HEAD>Federal Study: Fewer Defects In Condoms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fewer defective condoms are showing up on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, although more than 33 million condoms were recalled or rejected in the last year, a federal study says. Only about four in every 1,000 domestic condoms were deemed defective, an improvement from a 4.8 defective rate last year, said Dr. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which tested 115,000 condoms for such problems as pinholes and tears. Imported condoms proved more risky, with a defective rate of 6.5 per 1,000, which was still a drop from last year's rate of 7.3, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> testing that ended last month resulted in more than 30 million imported condoms being kept from distribution and 3 million domestic condoms taken off the shelves in 19 recalls, according to the study. `` Although the level of defects in condoms has dropped, there is a need to continually improve the defective rate,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to make random tests. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> issued its report Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting, where hundreds from academia, government and industry exchanged ideas on topics ranging from the spread of disease to how microorganisms can help control acid rain. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> and other health professionals have said condoms and mutually faithful monogamous relationships remain the best weapons to prevent the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEAD>Nursing Home's English-Only Policy Upsets Hispanic Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hispanic workers at a nursing home have been told they can no longer speak their native tongue on the job, an order some of the workers have challenged as discriminatory. `` I continue to speak Spanish,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, a nurses' aide at <ORGANIZATION> Nutmeg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavilion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe I'm going to be fired, but I'm going to fight for my rights.'' `` I do n't feel comfortable in my job anymore,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, another aide at <LOCATION> Nutmeg </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel free when I'm working, so it's very difficult to do the job. Officials outlined the policy to employees at a staff meeting last week, according to staff members quoted in today's editions of The Day newspaper of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The policy requires that employees speak English in all areas except the coffee lounge during working hours. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON>, administrator of the facility, defended the policy and said the workers have not filed any formal protest. `` On the floor we're to communicate with patients and other staff to the utmost,'' <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> said. `` If I do n't know what you're talking about, it's difficult to be a team. <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> said it makes English-speaking patients uncomfortable when they can not understand the health-care workers. `` Whether it's Spanish or German or Greek or Gaelic is beside the point,'' <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpryn </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he has not heard of any similar policies at other nursing homes. <PERSON> Arvid </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said most of <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M's employees speak English on the job, `` but we do n't have any policy that says they have to.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he values multilingual employees who can interpret for non-English speaking patients, and he often hears employees speaking in another language in the patient care areas, which he has no objections to. Mrs. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> said the policy affects seven nurses that she knows of. `` There is no law I know of in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that says you can only speak English,'' she said. `` Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's discrimination.'' The nurses said they have complained to the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunities </ORGANIZATION>, but have been told that panel can not help them.

<HEAD>More Older Minorities in High School, Census Bureau Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says that 11 percent of black and Hispanic Americans aged 18 to 21 are still in high school, double the rate for whites. The agency, in a report released Tuesday, also found that 25 percent of the young blacks and 22 percent of the Hispanics in that age group were enrolled in college, compared with 39 percent of their white peers. The proportion of young blacks dropping out of high school plummeted from 27 percent in 1975 to 17 percent in 1985, while the proportion who were graduated from high school rose from 61 percent to 71 percent. But the proportion enrolled in college stayed the same _ 25 percent, said the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report, `` School Enrollment: Social and Economic Characteristics of Students.'' Forty-seven percent of the blacks in the 18-21 age group were high school graduates not enrolled in college, up from 36 percent in 1975. Eleven percent of blacks were still in high school in 1985, down from 12.5 percent in 1975. Among Hispanics, the proportion enrolled in college dropped over the decade from 24 percent to 22 percent; the proportion of high school graduates not enrolled in college rose from 33 percent to 38 percent; the proportion of dropouts fell from 31 to 29 percent; and the proportion still in high school dipped from 12 percent to 11 percent. Among whites, the proportion enrolled in college grew from 35 percent to 39 percent; the proportion of high school graduates not enrolled in college dropped from 46 percent to 42.5 percent; the proportion of dropouts fell from 15 percent to 14 percent; and those still in high school grew slightly, from 4.7 percent to 5.1 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Other </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports have previously noted a sharp spurt in black college enrollments before 1975, and a drop since then in the proportion of black graduates advancing to college.

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today that an eight-day sit-down strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard showed Solidarity's strength but that lack of widespread support hurt the strikers. `` We were paralyzed because there were so few of us,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> near the shipyard in this <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port, where the electrician led workers to form the Soviet bloc's first independent union federation eight years ago. He said this month's action showed `` our strength as well as our helplessness'' and that the workers would try again if necessary. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and about 1,000 haggard strikers who had occupied the plant and refused to work abandoned their strike Tuesday evening. Strike leaders said they wanted to avoid a police raid, but communist authorities said the action failed for lack of support. Still, the government said the two weeks of strikes that ended Tuesday will compel it to speed up efforts to revive <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippled economy Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that the decision to end the strike was judicious and `` so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported some shipyard supervisors were back at work today and normal work would resume Thursday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he got a phone call at home in the morning asking him why he was not there. `` If there are people who think we lost, it is because we still lack solidarity'' among workers nationwide, he said. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said that `` if necessary we will try again. Nothing ended. Nothing is finished.'' He added that the 15-member strike committee that engaged in five rounds of negotiations with management will not be dissolved. There was no immediate word on whether the strikers would face legal charges or disciplinary action. During negotiations, the strikers had been offered amnesty but only if they left the shipyard Sunday night. Heads held high, the shipyard workers filed out of the yard without a settlement Tuesday but also without having backed down from demands whose centerpiece was reinstatement of the yard's Solidarity chapter Through the intervention of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, workers and management met five times from Saturday until Monday. Police had surrounded the shipyard since Thursday and the strikers had rejected government offers of wage increases, so quitting was the `` best solution possible,'' said strike committee chairman <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>. The strike evoked memories of 1980, when a younger, leaner <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> cosigned an accord at the same shipyard during a nationwide wave of strikes over price increases that toppled a government. A time of unmatched freedom followed. The rest of the country did not follow suit this time, leaving the shipyard workers in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city largely isolated. Urban said on Tuesday that `` the strikes and protests have not won the support of the working class and society'' but had taught the government important lessons. `` The May events will compel the government to more consistently develop reform, which should be more strongly felt by society,'' he said. The government planned today to introduce a bill that would allow it to take over money-losing enterprises and fire managers who resist economic change. Its reform program has increased prices by 42 percent this year. And a <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> statement on Tuesday's meeting of the ruling Politburo spoke of the `` indispensible'' need to quicken democratization _ a process it has so far only vaguely described. Five major strikes since April 25 added up to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity. The labor federation was banned in 1982. During negotiations, the mostly young strikers often appeared more militant than their elders. On Monday, the young strikers refused to accept a compromise largely agreed to by the strike committee. Solidarity chaplain the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> said the strike committee had voted 13-2 to end the stoppage. `` I wanted to avoid the police taking them out,'' he said. `` There were many wonderful young men there, and I could not allow them to be beaten.'' Besides recognition of Solidarity, the strikers had demanded monthly raises of at least $ 38 based on their current average of about $ 105, reinstatement of fired Solidarity activists, freedom for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers. Similar demands had been made by workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steelworks in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, whose 10-day stoppage was crushed Thursday by a violent, pre-dawn raid. The other strikes were settled peacefully: at a defense-related heavy machinery plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and among transit workers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today reopened talks on a troubled arms control treaty and said he was sure the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to resolve differences that led the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to shelve the pact indefinitely. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, before meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, refused to blame the Soviets for differences over how to monitor the destruction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. `` I am not trying to characterize the disagreements,'' he told reporters on his flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Problems have arisen, and since no one has ever done anything like this before, there are problems. We approach this in a problem-solving way.'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, in a telephone interview today with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` We think that we can iron out our differences. `` They are not very big,'' he said, `` so we still hope and we think that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is going to ratify the treaty before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.'' The summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled for May 29-June 2. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Tuesday, had said he was not sure what the problems over the treaty were. He said the Soviets had answered questions posed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Basically the verification problems regarding the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty have been resolved, I think,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said today the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could ratify the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> works out disputes in this week's talks `` I think there's still time to get the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratification prior to the summit. But these matters have to be dealt with,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' The treaty, signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit meeting in December, is the first to scrap an entire category of nuclear arms. It also provides for unprecedented on-site inspection of missile factories and bases to guard against cheating. In the last few weeks, the Soviets had raised objections to various procedures proposed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side. These include the scope of inspection within designated areas and use of cameras. Asked if he thought the Soviets were backsliding or causing trouble, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not criticize <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In fact, he said of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, `` he wants to see the INF treaty completed and into operation as much as I do. As problems arise, I am sure he will want to look at them.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he hoped the treaty will be ratified before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begins the summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But he said, `` I ca n't tell what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will do.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> planned to meet twice today and twice Thursday on the problems and on the wide range of summit topics, including human rights. The differences over verification have prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to postpone indefinitely ratification of the treaty to scrap 683 Soviet missiles and 364 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rockets. With the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit less than three weeks away, the trouble over the treaty is a severe setback to the arms control process. Already, there is virtually no hope of completing a second accord to sharply reduce long-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons before the summit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the Soviets are trying to restrict the access of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitors to Soviet missile plants and sites. This would leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unable to guarantee that the Soviets are not cheating on the agreement, which bans medium and shorter-range missiles. After <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> winds up his talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Thursday, he flies to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials before going home.

 A gunboat with 30 <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> soldiers today headed for an island where a self-styled king threatened to declare independence from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> archipelago, the army said. It said a navy patrol boat was on its way to the <LOCATION> Rotuma </LOCATION>, 400 miles north of <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION>, in case of trouble from the <PERSON> Malmahao </PERSON> clan, whose leader intended to secede from <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. Reports from <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON> said the island would hoist the British flag and declare its secession on Friday, the 107th anniversary of <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON>'s annexation by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> was a British colony until 1970, when it became an independent nation within the Commonwealth. Saturday marks the first anniversary of the military coup that ousted the Indian-dominated government of <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>. Seven months ago, coup leader <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> a republic. <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON>'s self-styled king is <PERSON> Sau </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagfatmaro </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a martial arts expert with a home in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. He is partly of Rotuman descent. <PERSON> Lagfatmaro </PERSON> has claimed the title `` gagaj,'' meaning king, of one of the seven clans forming the Rotuman community and has said that on Friday his supporters will lower the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> flag. <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON> since 1881 has been administered from <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION>, first by the British and since 1970 by <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. Unlike <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, where most of the 715,000 population is <LOCATION> Melanesian </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON>'s 3,000 residents are mostly Polynesian. <PERSON> Lagfatmaro </PERSON>'s whereabouts were not immediately known, but several of his followers had been reported arrested and charged with sedition. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Barltrop </PERSON>, was visiting <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON> at the invitation of the island council. Further details were not available. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, meantime, was reported planning a parade on Saturday to commemorate the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s first military takeover. Army sources said <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, army commander as well as a member of the semi-military government, had called all territorial soldiers to barracks as a precaution against expected protests by coup opponents.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> responded angrily to a court-appointed official's report that she spent some $ 200,000 donated for her late son's liver transplants on herself, relatives and friends. `` I am not a thief. I did not do anything wrong,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said Tuesday after an unrelated hearing over a $ 1,000 state fine levied against her in the wake of charges that she violated <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s charity laws. `` I resent the way I'm being treated, the way it's been handled,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' 7-year-old son <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> last year while awaiting a fourth liver transplant. His plight resulted in a highly publicized fund-raising drive that included a $ 1,000 donation from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Geivers </PERSON>, appointed at the request of the Dade state attorney's office to review Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' spending, on Monday filed court documents listing questionable expenses paid from the donations. Among the payments were $ 10,850 to a jewelry store, $ 23,700 to Ms. DeSillers' ex-boyfriend, and $ 96,527 in cash withdrawals for personal expenses. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has said the expenditures were reasonable and that she needed the clothing and jewelry to look `` professional'' when she tried to raise money for organ donor awareness after her son's death She is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ronnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeSillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> in her report accused Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> of having `` ignored the laws ... when it suited her purposes to do so.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> denied the charges. `` I'm not saying I'm perfect. But ... how could she say on there that I know the law and I disregarded it. It's crazy.'' Among the questionable expenditures found by Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> were $ 5,798 to the Cache clothing store, $ 3,163 for furniture, $ 6,134 for Ms. DeSillers' brother <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchante </PERSON>, $ 13,500 for a used BMW, $ 23,700 to her attorneys and $ 44,359 to other sick children. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said the money to Dimas jewelry was to buy back items she had pawned in early 1987 to pay her son's medical expenses. The payments to her brother and to her boyfriend <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> were for loans they had made to her, she said. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is appealing the charity law fine, and at the Tuesday hearing <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Office accused Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> of misleading the public `` I do n't think that the people who donated money intended that the money for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> should go for cars, the rent, jewelry and certain other expenditures,'' <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said. Hearing examiner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will make a decision on the fine within 30 days, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' attorney. According to court documents, almost $ 300,000 of the $ 527,000 that remained in <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s account when he died has been spent. About $ 243,500 remains in the estate.

 Soldiers and police arrested at least six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists today, and leaders of the Palestinian uprising issued a new leaflet calling on Arabs to store enough food for a month of civil disobedience. The army command today said it was pleased with the response of Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to a potentially explosive campaign to issue new identity cards to the area's 400,000 adults. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since 1967, began demonstrating against the occupation last Dec. 8. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 185 Palestinians have died in the five months of violence. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish teen-age settler also have been killed. `` The uprising has made the Palestinian problem a central issue in the world,'' said the leaflet distributed in the occupied lands and in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which was annexed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The uprising is becoming a ghost which scares the enemy.'' It urged `` a complete boycott of the Zionists'' and asks the people to `` ready themselves for civil disobedience by storing food in houses, enough for at least a month.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and its suburbs, police and soldiers began rounding up journalists and community leaders at about 1 a.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB-, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. At least 11 people were seized, including two editors of the pro-Palestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION>, which has become a voice of the uprising. Four other journalists were arrested, along with a union leader, head of a youth council, and several other Palestinians, the reports said. The army refused to comment on the reports. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that 47 people have been charged with manslaughter in the death of man who allegedly collaborated with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. The victim, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Id </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakanda </PERSON>, was lynched by a mob in the village of <LOCATION> Qabatiye </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in February. Today, soldiers with loudspeakers ordered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> merchants to close their shops in the morning but said they could open any time after noon. The move is part of a continued effort to force storekeepers to operate at times dictated by the army, not by uprising leaders who have ordered repeated general strikes. The new leaflet, the 16th issued by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, called for demonstrations on the Moslem holy day, Friday, and a general strike and `` day of anger'' next Sunday. It also urged protests on Id el Fitr, the end of the Moslem fasting month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, which is expected to be Monday or Tuesday when the new moon is sighted. It also urged a general strike on May 21. The leaflet called on Palestinians to keep refusing to pay taxes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to refuse to obtain new government identity cards. The army began a campaign on Tuesday to force 400,000 residents of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to get new cards, a move that protest leaders say is aimed at catching tax evaders and breaking the five-month uprising. `` The first day of the program to issue new identification cards passed very well,'' an army spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. `` There were no incidents and 2,000 people received new cards.'' The army has outlined a month-long first phase encompassing 200,000 adults between the ages of 16 to 60 in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The government also has been pushing to collect back taxes and other lapsed fees. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising issued leaflets and had broadcast warnings from mosque loudspeakers urging residents not to cooperate with the army. They charge the ID program is a plot to break the Palestinian uprising, a main tactic of which is nonpayment of taxes. The left-wing daily <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamishmar </PERSON> today issued a scathing editorial of the army plan, saying the army might be trying to put pressure on the families of young Palestinian protesters by denying their parents the new card. It could create `` a layer of ` cardless' residents who will be illegal residents in an area where they live and even were born.'' Jewish settlers, meanwhile, reacted angrily to charges by the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, that they were aggravating tensions in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> angered Jewish settlers on Tuesday when he told a parliamentary committee the settlers were raising tensions in the occupied lands. `` It's as if he would say the residents of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border were responsible for the <LOCATION> Katyusha </LOCATION> rockets fired at them -LRB- from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON>, a leader of Gush Emunim, a religious settlement movement. `` The Arabs want to throw us out of all of the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

 Shiite Moslem militias with tanks, howitzers, rockets and mortars fought each other today for control of the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said 26 people were killed and 61 wounded. A cease-fire called by Syrian and Iranian mediators went into effect eight hours after fighting began at 2:30 a.m., police said. Earlier today, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> repeated a warning that it might use its troops to halt the battle between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which had shattered an earlier 24-hour truce. The battle occurred near where many of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held. There was no word on the hostages. Since fighting broke out Friday, 180 people have been killed and 433 wounded. `` We hold the -LRB- militia -RRB- leaders responsible for all the crimes committed against humanity in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and urge them to order a cease-fire before it is too late,'' acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by all radio stations before the truce was announced. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> residents were shaken awake by the thuds of exploding shells that echoed across the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital as <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for hope, mounted a five-pronged attack against <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. A police spokesman said tank-led Amal forces, advancing behind a fierce barrage of howitzer, rocket and mortar fire, dislodged <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists from several areas they had conquered in the past five days on the western edge of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> abutting the airport highway. He said flight schedules were unaffected and that passengers reached the airport through side streets. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stormed Amal positions deep in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and occupied the militia's main base in the district of <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Barajneh </LOCATION>, east of the airport highway, he said. The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations, said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> occupied a police station in <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> el-Barajneh. The Sahel hospital, closest to the contested area, advised rescuers through the Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio to take the wounded to other hospitals because `` we ca n't cope with the flood of casualties.'' The police spokesman said Syrian officers and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> ordered the cease-fire, the fourth since Friday, after contacting <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` Fighting eased into sporadic exchanges of automatic fire,'' the spokesman said. Before the cease-fire was announced, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, repeated a warning that his troops may intervene to stop the fighting. `` If the bloodletting continues, we will have no other option but to respond to the pleas of the population and end their ordeal,'' <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by all <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent 7,500 troops to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to curb militia lawlessness in the Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital. The slums, however, were outside the Syrian contingent's jurisdiction Thirty-six Syrian officers and six joint cease-fire committees moved into the slums on Tuesday to enforce the truce. But Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> used the calm to fortify their positions for another round of violence. Police said Amal brought about 2,500 fighters from its strongholds in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the 24-hour lull to help its 4,000-strong force in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> stage today's attack. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> had gained control of much of the slums before Friday. Its fighting strength is estimated at 3,000. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab backer in its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But there have been growing signs of a strain in the alliance amid pressures on <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> from other Arab nations to distance itself from <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> its exclusive sphere of influence, also has been angry over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s drive, using <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> as its instrument, to dominate the 1.2 million Shiites in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the country's largest single sect.

 After saying <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not talked with her astrolger in a couple of months, White House officials were caught off guard today when the stargazer said she had been in touch with the first lady this week. `` I just do n't know anything about it,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the press secretary to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I was n't aware they had talked. I had no idea.'' The astrolger, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said she had spoken with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this week but would not reveal her reaction to the flap over the use of stargazing in planning the schedule of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>'s statement contradicted what <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials were saying. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> both said on Tuesday that it had been `` a couple of months'' since Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been in touch with the astrologer. In his new book, former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says the first lady regularly consulted a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> astrologer about scheduling for the president, policy matters and decisions. The White House has adopted a `` no-comment'' policy on specifics in the book, trying to dampen the stargazing controversy. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, at his regular news briefing, was asked whether Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had used a `` secure'' telephone line to speak with <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, and if not, had there been a breach of security. `` I have no idea,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied. Asked to assess the role of astrology in preparation of the president's schedule, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have not commented on that in the past, and I would say only that the president's scheduling is a process involving many people and many different considerations and concerns. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> had been to the White House only once, at a state dinner. Other than that, the first lady had communicated with her only by telephone, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. She said she did not know how often they talked.

<TEXT>
 Four whites, including a woman and two army deserters, were arrested and accused of amassing a large arms cache to carry out attacks for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, police said today. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, in a statement, described the four as `` a highly specialized terror unit.'' The weaponry seized in connection with their arrests Sunday was described as the largest arms cache ever uncovered by the police. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said it included a Soviet-made ground-to-air missile, limpet mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, mchine guns, mortars and explosives. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> alleged that the suspects had been trained in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and had radio transmitters which they used to communicate with the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. The congress, outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1960, began a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the next year aimed at toppling white-minority rule. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said three of the suspects were South African citizens and declined to give the nationality of the fourth. He said two had deserted from the armed forces and one was a former South African journalist. They all were in their 20s and 30s, he said. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said police were still investigating how the weapons were brought into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but he said the arms came overland through <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. By law and custom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 It was n't a White Christmas, but dozens of fans who usually sing Christmas carols to composer <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th birthday. The reclusive composer, who hates to get up in the morning and wrote a song to that effect, did n't put in an appearance. `` If he's 100, he's probably sleeping,'' said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of 75 people was doing in front of the five-story brick mansion in <LOCATION> Beekman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>, an exclusive East Side enclave. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, who organized the midnight Tuesday serenade and has organized the Christmas carol singing outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s door for at least 20 years, was sure <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was awake. `` He's a night owl, I've seen him walking his dog at 3 a.m.,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s secretary confirmed that. `` When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was very thrilled by that,'' <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said at mid-morning. She added that the composer was spending the day `` quietly at home. He's never made a big thing about his birthdays.'' During a singing a somewhat intoxicated reveler yelled `` HAAApppy Birthday Irving'' at the drawn shades of 17 Beekman Place. `` We love you. Where are youuuuu?'' Many of those gathered seemed to be neighbors hoping to catch a rare glimpse of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Just before the singing began, a shade went up in the house and the crowd gasped. But it was a teen-age girl and a matron. Both waved and the crowd waved back. `` Even if he did n't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of American history,'' said 21-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiessman </PERSON>, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this guy wrote a lot. I love ` God Bless America.' Every American has got to love it.'' The music and lyrics among the more than 1,500 songs <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> created for the stage, screen and popular music are inextricably woven into the American culture. They include `` White Christmas,'' `` Easter Parade,'' `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band,'' `` There's No Business Like Show Business,'' `` Puttin' on the Ritz,'' `` Blue Skies,'' `` Cheek to Cheek,'' and `` Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> honored the composer today with a motion wishing him `` many more White Christmases and Easter Parades.'' Today's informal serenade will be followed tonight by a Carnegie Hall tribute to the composer, with stars like <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> scheduled to appear. <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> got the crowd ready by reading through a song he composed for the occasion. `` Just think, 100 years ago this little Russian lady was very pregnant,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s birth on May 11, 1888, in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Then he told the crowd to sing `` softly, with great love.'' The crowd sang `` Happy Birthday,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s `` Always'' and <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>'s `` The Songs of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' which included the broad hint, `` Knock on my door and I'll welcome you in.'' Nearly five years ago, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> was invited into the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home on Christmas Eve after a chorus of `` White Christmas.'' On an impulse, he rang the doorbell. A maid answered and took him and his fellow singers into the kitchen. There they were greeted by <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> himself, in bathrobe and slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and told them, `` That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.'' Still no <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, so the crowd ran through `` We'll be loving you, always'' again. Another shade went up but again it was the teen-age girl. `` Hey,'' the drunk said. `` We would love to see <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. Please bring him to the window.'' The dispersing neighbors said they did not really expect to see him. It's a neighborhood known for its recluses like <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> did n't show either.

 <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS education campaign, has resigned just as the agency is about to mail controversial AIDS brochures to 107 million households across the nation, a spokeswoman said today.

Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> resigned a week ago Saturday, three days before the government unveiled the brochure it plans to send to every American household, according to today's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. The brochures are scheduled to be mailed beginning May 26. She told the newspaper she was working 90 hour weeks and was leaving the AIDS information program `` partly to find some balance in my life.'' The agency made no public announcement of Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>' departure, but <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said today there was no attempt to keep it secret The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> does not routinely announce staff resignations, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> was out of town and could not be reached today for comment on the reason for her resignation. `` My understanding is she was made an offer too good to refuse,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know of any dissatisfaction she had about the pamphlet.'' An assistant, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, also will leave the agency June 30, to return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and work on various projects, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Ms. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said she did not know why Ms. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> was leaving the AIDS program, and Ms. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director for AIDS activities and Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>' supervisor, was out of the country and could not be reached for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> said the job change will provide relief from the constant pressure, unending travel and `` 90-hour weeks'' of the AIDS education effort. `` For me it is partly an opportunity to find some balance in my life, to work at a pace that will allow me to have more of a personal life. No matter what some people say about government, we work real long hours, really hard,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> on April 19, 1987, after serving as executive director of AIDS Project <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, an AIDS service agency.

At the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> was put in charge of plans for the first national direct mail campaign sponsored by the federal government. The campaign got off to a rocky start.

 Republican primary voters gave <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> a shot at a record fourth term and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> a hard-fought victory in the first election of his brief political career. But <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who survived an aggressive challenge by Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, may have a tougher time defeating the Democratic primary winner, former Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>. Other results from Tuesday's primaries in the two states showed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> easily winning <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic nomination for a sixth term. He will face state Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, who won the Republican primary. In the Democratic primary for governor, insurance executive <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> won a seven-way race for the chance to face <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who edged millionaire businessman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> voters approved a measure raising salaries of lawmakers in the nation's only one-chamber Legislature from $ 4,800 to $ 12,000. It's their first raise in 20 years. And in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s 2nd District, where <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> gave up his seat, Democrats denied a congressional nomination to <PERSON> Cece </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>, widow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>. Instead, former state Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON> will be the Democratic nominee and will face <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenken </PERSON>, winner of a four-way Republican race. `` We did it!'' an elated <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> told supporters as he claimed victory late Tuesday. `` And the thing that I am so proud about is that we did it the old-fashioned way _ we earned every single vote.'' <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race had been rated a toss-up in pre-election polls, but <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> _ who was appointed 14 months ago and is the nation's youngest senator at age 38 _ won by a wide margin. With 99 percent of the vote counted, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> had 114,101 votes or 55 percent and <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> had 93,236 votes or 45 percent. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> was quick to congratulate <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> on `` his very sound and impressive victory'' and promised to help him in November. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was a supporter of Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s election and she appointed him to fill <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>'s seat after he died in March 1987. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, 47, was one of several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars who sought the job. For the Democrats, <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> had 152,363 votes or 91.6 percent and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer, had 13,889 votes or 8.4 percent. `` I know the task over the next five months is going to be difficult,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said, shrugging off polls that have showed him the clear favorite.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will refer to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics Committee the alleged failure of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> to report meals paid for by an industry lobbyist, sources familiar with the probe said today. Concluding an investigation that was launched last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is `` declining prosecution'' of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Democrat, department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> issued a two-sentence statement saying he had been informed by his attorney of the decision and that `` this means the case is closed.'' However, the department plans to refer the matter to the ethics committee, which will decide whether it intends to review the case for possible disciplinary action against <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>. The committee launches investigations under five different procedures, none of which involves the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The department investigated allegations that <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> accepted food, drink and entertainment from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> and other financial industry lobbyists. That is a possible violation of a federal anti-bribery statute forbidding members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from accepting anything of value in exchange for an official act. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe also focused on possible congressional reporting requirement violations in connection with the alleged free meals and entertainment. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON>, has said he was confident <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> would not be charged with any wrongdoing because `` we've shown to them that there's a degree of inaccuracy in the league records. <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> said last year that one reimbursement submitted to the league by its lobbyist shows that he was having dinner with <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> was on television debating his opponent live in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` The fact of the matter is there are dozens upon dozens of instances where he was out of town,'' <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> said. League spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has said, however, that the league keeps accurate expense records and has internal controls and audits. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one reason prosecution was declined was because <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s record-keeping was inaccurate House rules require reporting gifts such as meals worth more than $ 250 in a single calendar year, but do n't count toward the limit meals worth less than $ 35. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unidentified sources familiar with the investigation as saying that it would be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each meal eaten by <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> totaled more than the $ 35 limit. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation followed a 14-month probe by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee into allegations that <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> used his chairmanship for personal gain. The committee found that the 14-term congressman violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules by underreporting his assets by more than $ 1 million and by accepting a free plane ride from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> savings and loan association. But no disciplinary action was recommended.

 A bill authorizing a statue of an Army nurse at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today over objections that it might encourage other groups to demand similar sculptures. The committee passed the measure, which has 63 sponsors, on a voice vote and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor after the lone dissenter, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., protested what he called a threat to the artistic integrity of the memorial The bill, however, contained an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., that strengthens a declaration that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not allow any other statues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze sculpture of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> women's sculpture is approved `` This will be the last one,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., the committe chairman `` But the last for how long?'' retorted <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who took pains to stress that his opposition had nothing to do with his respect for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. The proposal for a new statue honoring the 10,000 women who served in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> conflict was introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn. At a committee hearing last February, the proposal was applauded by veterans' groups but criticized by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON>, former executive director of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial Fund, who said the woman's statue would `` destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of the memorial <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> already had received demands for statues honoring others who had served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, including native Americans and even scout dogs. The memorial, situated on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial, features a long black granite slab bearing the names of 58,156 Vietnam War dead, including eight uniformed nurses. Two years after the memorial was dedicated in 1982, a controversial statue of three battle-weary infantrymen and a 60-foot flagpole were erected on the 2.2-acre site. The proposed addition to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial, the most popular tourist attraction among national monuments in the capital, has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> but rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who called himself the grand sachem of the Mohegan-Pequot Indian Nation and conducted a marriage ceremony for newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, has died. He was 90. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, known as `` Chief Rolling Cloud,'' died Tuesday at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital. He broke his hip in a fall at his home last month. Best known as an Indian leader involved in lawsuits seeking the return of land to his southeastern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> tribe, he was also a cowboy who worked the Western range during the first quarter of this century. In the 1930s, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to protect Indian rights. He remained its head for decades. In addition to speaking in behalf of Indian causes, he lectured, wrote music and led an orchestra. He used the title `` grand sachem,'' although the chairman of the Mohegan tribal council said the last grand sachem died in 1769 and the title did not exist. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> became a national figure in the early 1970s because of his practice of `` adopting'' people into the Mohegan-Pequot Nation. Among those he adopted was <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, kidnapped in the early 1970s by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Texas Authorities Raid Unlicensed Boys' Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities launched a surprise inspection at an unlicensed home for boys today, taking away one youth and issuing citations to 19 men who locked arms to hinder officials from entering. Authorities snapped a padlocked gate and broke through the human chain shortly after 6 a.m. to begin inspecting birth certificates of children at the facility run by the Rev. W.N. <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON>. The inspection involved the state attorney general's office, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> have disagreed for two years about whether the facility should be licensed by the state, and <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> at one time agreed to close the facility. The facility is a combination home for troubled boys, a church-run school and preschool. It has about 25 boys and 10 toddlers and pre-schoolers, said church secretary <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. A state district judge ruled April 12 that state officials could inspect the facility in the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> compound at any time and remove children found there without a relative or guardian. `` They played it low-key. They said they did n't want a confrontation,'' said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON>, the reverend's son, of today's multi-agency inspection <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusek </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general, said a 17-year-old youth lacking guardianship papers was removed from the facility and taken to a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> emergency shelter, and that 19 men were cited for preventing execution of civil process. In March 1986, a state district judge in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> ordered <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> to close the home, but in November 1987 suspended $ 97,000 in fines after the minister promised he would keep the home closed unless the state passed a law exempting church homes from licensing. The state has never done so. <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> reopened the facility this spring in mobile homes, vowing to renew his fight over licensing. `` If they come to shut us down, we'll just pick her up and sail her on down the road,'' said <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON>, who has previously contended that the requirement that he seek a state license violated the constitutional separation of church and state. Parents of several of the 25 students attending the school have been staying at the compound in past weeks anticipating an inspection, said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Authorities herded everyone into the school auditorium, asked to see children's birth certificates and released them when parents showed documents, she said. Rocky Otwell, interviewed by telephone, said his father was too busy to comment on the incident. `` He's upset, but there's not visibly any angry words exchanged,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today promised tens of thousands of jobless miners and dirt-poor peasants the church would help them pursue a society of love, solidarity and justice. In a one-hour morning visit to the hard-hit mining city of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, the pontiff said he was aware of the crisis in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s tin mining industry. In <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the government of President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> canceled a scheduled meeting between <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and a group of Paraguayans that included opposition leaders. Authorities cited `` security reasons.'' The pontiff arrived in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on Friday for a 13-day tour of four South American nations. He is to leave <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> Saturday for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on Monday. `` The deep mines that years ago were the great source of national wealth ... are now only mute witnesses to the so many lives consumed silently there,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the miners. `` I come with a message of hope, which does not mean passivity in the face of misery that each day becomes more evident, but instead is an obligation to construct a new society founded in love, solidarity and justice.'' The pope spoke from a tall platform that gave him a clear view of the entrance to <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>'s state-run <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> mine, from which most workers have been laid off in a government austerity program. An umbrella held by an aide sheltered the pontiff from the intense sun of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s wind-swept altiplano, or high plain. <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION> is 12,160 feet above sea level. Local mining union leader <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told the pope: `` Today you have not heard the call of our work sirens, because the mines are empty, and in our mining camps you hear only the wail of children, because they can not lift bread to their mouths.'' A rural farmer also spoke to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>: `` We peasants suffer a lot. Treated very badly, we suffer for our produce. Prices are not good. We are cheated.'' Unemployment in <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, a city of 132,000, is running at easily twice the national average of 22 percent. It is considered the center of misery in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, itself <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country. The collapse of world tin prices prompted <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s conservative government to shut down 14 of 21 state-run mines, leaving 21,500 of 27,000 miners out of work. The pope was to return from <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, where he spent Tuesday night in a monastery. He had several events planned for this afternoon in <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, including a mass and an encounter with the country's youth. <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION> is the gateway to the country's principal coca-growing region and a center for cocaine trafficking. It also is plagued by a growing problem with local drug consumption, especially among the young and poor. In <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> reaffirmed the importance the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> places on traditional values and criticized a Bolivian Indian custom of concubinage. The meeting in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> was scheduled to bring together diverse members of the Paraguayan civilian sector, including leaders of opposition parties that are not recognized by the government. The government had criticized the invitation of opposition politicians to the meeting.

 Security forces exchanged gunfire today with Sikh extremists holed up inside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, and police said witnesses had seen the bodies of five radicals inside the complex. Electricity and water were cut off to the temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, on Tuesday after more than 800 pilgrims were evacuated, according to security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity Heavy firing was reported early today between an estimated 100 extremists and about 2,500 police and paramilitary forces surrounding the walled complex, which covers about five city blocks. <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of police, said at least 10 people have been killed and 10 injured since the violence began Monday. He said there were reports that five bodies of Sikh radicals were inside the temple but there was no way for police to verify them. Police earlier reported that three bodies, believed to be Sikh militants, were seen at daybreak on the ground outside the temple complex. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakeem </PERSON>, a paramilitary police commander, said it could not be determined if the men had fallen from the temple rooftop or killed while attempting to sneak in or out of the shrine. <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> said his men had orders to fire on anyone moving inside the shrine. He said that his troops could see entrances to food stores and an ammunitions dump inside the shrine and were preventing militants from getting to them. `` We will keep this up for a least a few more days,'' <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> said. `` Either the militants will be forced to surrender or will be eliminated.'' He added, `` We have no plans to enter the temple at this time.'' The temple's head priest, <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, was out of the temple for a speaking engagement on Monday and has not been allowed to return. He told reporters he asked authorities Tuesday for permission to return but was denied. He was conferring with Indian officials today on ways to resolve the confrontation, said <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> Police Supterindent Baldev <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a curfew imposed three days ago remained in place in most parts of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>'s old, walled sector. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, two men were killed by Sikh gunmen early today in the central <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> district, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The latest slaying raised to more than 940 the number of deaths blamed on the extremists this year. Since 1982, militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland for their minority sect in the northern state. Their attacks have increased in recent months, despite the federal government's decision a year ago to take direct control of security in the state. Although a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikhs comprise just 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people. The Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who make up 82 percent of the nationwide population. The temple siege began after at least five people were killed and 10 hurt in a gunbattle Monday between Sikhs inside the complex and security forces. The Golden Temple has become the main stronghold of Sikh separatists, and an estimated 100 were believed holed up in and around the shrine. The complex includes offices, living quarters, hostels for pilgrims, dining halls and kitchens. The temple itself is surrounded by a pool and reached by a single walkway. The security forces, beefed up after the initial outbreak of fire, were given orders on Tuesday to shoot anyone attempting to leave the shrine. Much of their gunfire on Tuesday afternoon was directed at a watch tower overlooking the temple's main entrance. In June 1984, the Indian army carried out a raid to drive militants from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and more than 1,200 people were killed. Five months later, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two Sikh bodguards in revenge. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, minister of state for home affairs, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today that `` other forces'' were being moved to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to deal with the situation, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. He did not elaborate.

Such a scheme would cost $ 140 million a year and require astronaut visits every three months for servicing. Congressional committees have balked at the idea, viewing it as a move to deprive the space station program of funds, thus killing it.

 About 12,000 doctors have joined a pharmaceutical company program that gives free heart medicine to needy patients since the program was expanded five weeks ago, a company spokesman said. Under the program, <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issues certificates to participating doctors, clinics and hospitals for heart medicine. Patients obtain the certificate and prescription from their doctors, then give them to pharmacists, who mail the certificate to <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for reimbursement. `` We are satisfied the program is a success,'' <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said by telephone Tuesday from <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s corporate headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>. During a 14-month pilot program that ended in April, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> distributed two kinds of high-blood pressure medication to 20,000 patients. On April 6, the company announced it would expand the giveaway to all seven of its heart medicines. Other drug companies have similar programs, but <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s is more extensive, said <PERSON> Judee </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The value of the pilot program was put at $ 9 million by <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said the program is available to clinics nationwide and that there is no time or money limit. `` These are life-time drugs. You would n't want to put someone on a drug that he is going to need all his life, then pull the plug on it later,'' he said. The drug giveaway is for people with no insurance or other assistance, and annual incomes of $ 8,000 or less for a family of one or two and $ 11,000 for larger families.

 Democrats rallied on Capitol Hill today and vowed to fight President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from now until November if he makes good on his threat to veto the 1,000-page trade bill. `` If you decide to pull out that pen, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, we will have to override that veto and we have the votes to do it,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., told listeners gathered at the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> It remained unclear, however, where supporters of the measure would find enough support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to override a presidential veto. The bill fell three votes short of what would be needed. `` We'll consult the stars,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said, drawing a laugh from the crowd Several hundred supporters including congressmen, their aides and labor officials spilled into the street as party leaders urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to relent and sign the measure. It was the final show of political muscle before sending the measure to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk.

At the rally, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> introduced Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., as `` the architect'' of the bill The ornate Statuary Hall next to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber was chosen as the site for ceremonies in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was signing the bill and sending it on to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Officials of labor unions and religious groups are among the invitees. Republicans are expected to be mainly absent from the festivities, aimed at pressuring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to drop his veto threat and sign the bill after all. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been critical of the bill's curbs on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports and its provision requiring companies with 100 employees or more to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> told a manufacturers' association the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recognized the popularity of the plant notification provision `` We've gotten together _ you and us and everyone whose been trying to ` fight' the notification -LRB- provision -RRB- _ a real political problem,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The polls have indicated that, from the people I've talked to, 62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right way to go. Another 13 percent think it should be much more stringent,'' she said. The major provisions of the bill have hardly figured in the debate in recent weeks. They would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import restrictions and takes other steps to aid endangered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries and retaliate against international trade violations. But there are numerous other provisions ranging from agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been saying the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions violate the Constitution by discriminating against that state's ports while the plant-closings feature would dull rather than sharpen the nation's edge in global markets Supporters of the plant-closings provision call it a humane and decent way to treat employees and their families. But there are only a handful of supporters for the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions, which <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been trying in vain to erase from the legislation. `` I had hoped that if these offending provisions had been eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing this bill,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said The remark appeared to mark the end of efforts to erase the provisions. The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been becalmed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> while leaders sought to do some after-the-fact custom tailoring. The House last week approved a resolution that would have instructed a congressional employee to call the enrolling clerk to smooth out any minor wrinkles in the bill _ and erase the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions while he was at it. To bring up the resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> needed unanimous consent and was unable to obtain it Tuesday when he sought to do so.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. May 9 The Baltimore Sun on defense spending: Presidential candidates talk little about it, but the military budget working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a clear signal of painful decisions awaiting the next administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to office trumpeting a `` defense buildup'' that in seven years raised military spending $ 2 trillion. His successor will have to trim the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> five-year plan by at least $ 300 billion and perhaps more than $ 500 billion -LRB- half a trillion -RRB-. Quite obviously, a `` defense builddown'' on this scale will require drastic cuts in manpower, in new weapons procurement, in the number of bases scattered around congressional districts and in overseas bases and commitments. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have hardly addressed this monumental prospect. Defense should be a major issue for the candidates because the intellectuals who advise them are already engaged in debate on the nation's future world role. Clearly, this is a period of marking time as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era limps to a close. Soon enough, a new president will have to take hold of a defense budget that will determine the country's military-diplomatic posture until the end of the century

Working with its ally, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia, the Israeli army thrust into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killed upward of 40 alleged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorists, captured 20 more, destroyed several guerrilla bases, and withdrew to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within 48 hours. ... As military actions go, this one was quick and efficient. It appears to have accomplished its purpose _ to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border That <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> found it necessary to re-enter <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, foraying out of the security zone it has imposed on that unhappy country, is without doubt regrettable. The action will not make Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace initiative any easier ... But let's not focus on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as to blame. It belongs, if anywhere, with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> radicals -LRB- backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Kremlin -RRB- who refuse to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and who use the Palestinian refugees as pawns in the bloody, cynical game of <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> power politics.

Over the years, this constant portrayal of continuous drinking as part of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lifestyle has made it part of the lifestyle. In the process, alcoholism has become the biggest drug-related killer of Americans during the past two generations. Perhaps it is time to address the problem of alcohol the same way the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general handled tobacco addiction. He did not treat cigarette smoking as a moral problem but as a menace to the health and welfare of the whole people. A similar campaign to educate and depopularize the use of alcohol might be equally effective.

While Sessions' remarks were labeled as `` pure speculation'' as they specifically concerned the many investigations into Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s private and public conduct, what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief said was worth noting. Sessions clearly grasps the imperative of public officials, particularly `` those related to the enforcement of the law, to be generally perceived by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public as being people who abide by the law.'' Call it sleaze, call it greed, call it situation ethics, some behavior simply can not be tolerated in public officials. ... The perception of sleaze erodes the respect that is fundamental in a system of laws. Choosing which laws we will obey, Sessions said, `` is contrary to the fabric of American society generally. We are a country of law.'' That is something every citizen must remember, from the stockbroker or laborer who snorts cocaine to an <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> who employs drug traffickers or an <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> who peddles influence.

 May 8 The Oshkosh -LRB- Wis. -RRB- Northwestern on the message of prison sentences: If sentences have messages, it is hard to tell what the message is when a man gets a six-year sentence on first degree sexual assault under circumstances that can only be described as extreme. The man was accused _ and pleaded no contest to _ the first degree charge in March and was sentenced last week. ... The victim was a 6-year-old girl. She was tied up at the time of the rape, and was totally at the disposal of the criminal. There is even some evidence that it was not a one-time crime. This was an extreme case. Yet the sentence handed down is less than one third of the maximum sentence. True, the maximum is perhaps to be reserved for such crimes done under threat of a weapon. But to a 6-year-old there's little difference whether there was a weapon present or not. Knowing the man may be out in four years does not tell society that first degree rape is being treated with the full vigor of the law.

We urge <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to ignore this advice and give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s veterans the care to which they are entitled. The measure would cover some 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. Many of those were at <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> in the weeks immediately following the atomic bombing of those Japanese cities in August 1945. Every military man puts his life on the line for his country, but those who entered the two bombed cities exposed themselves unknowingly to radiation which can cause sickness and death years afterward. Others affected by the bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to veto were in the armed forces after the war's end, when above-ground atomic blasts were done to test nuclear weapons. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s veterans of all ages deserve the best the country can provide for them, and that is especially true for those who were exposed to deadly radiation in the performance of their duties. We urge President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to put these veterans ahead of the government's worries about legal liabilities.

 A car packed with explosives blew up today on a bridge minutes after police had chased it away from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. Three people were killed and 15 wounded. The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an Arab man who owned the car was arrested while trying to run away from the scene. A caller claiming to represent terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> this morning at a bureau in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s organization was responsible for the bombing. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAndrew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of news information, quoted the caller as saying it was the first of future attacks against Israeli targets. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, has been accused by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Western intelligence agencies of directing scores of terrorist attacks. They include simultaneous assaults at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports Dec. 27, 1985, that killed 20 people. His group, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, broke in 1976 with <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream guerrilla faction led by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the Israeli Embassy was a possible target of today's bombing. Authorities said windows were shattered in the building but no one there was injured. The Mitsubishi Pajero exploded and disintegrated in the middle of the bridge on a main highway, less than 200 yards from the embassy. The explosion set four other vehicles on the bridge ablaze. A police statement said a briefcase containing a remote-control detonating device was found about 200 yards from the site of the blast. No further details were available. A police statement said the car's driver and a Greek Cypriot woman who was in a car immediately behind were killed. Another Greek Cypriot, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Frangos </PERSON>, a retired diplomat, was in another nearby car and died of his wounds in a hospital a few hours later. Fifteen other people were taken to <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with various wounds, hospital officials said. The news agency said the arrested <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, whom it did not name, had arrived on the island on March 21. Later today, scores of policemen converged on a <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> apartment building where the man lived and searched it. Police said the car with the bomb had a foreign visitor's temporary <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> registration plates and twice tried to park outside the four-story embassy in a narrow side street Cypriot police guards told the driver parking was forbidden and the car sped off toward the <LOCATION> Grivas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> bridge. The explosion came a minute later, the statement said. `` There must have been a lot of explosives packed in that car,'' <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifyllis </PERSON> told newsmen at the scene. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio: `` We do not know yet who is responsible. But it is certainly possible that the embassy was the terrorists' target and that the car -LRB- bomb -RRB- exploded prematurely for some reason.'' Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> condemned the attempted bomb attack. `` The explosion, in the wake of which innocent Cypriots were hurt, was another attempt to exploit the soil of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> for terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the ministry said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> called it another `` terror attempt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Israelis, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representation outside the region. Terror has become part of our life.'' However, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he would not describe the attack as an escalation in the war between Arab guerrillas and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On Monday, police arrested a Lebanese at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> airport who was carrying a silencer-equipped pistol and two full ammunition magazines hidden in a radio-casette player. The arrested man, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON>, 22, had just arrived on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlines </LOCATION> flight from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the pistol was discovered during an X-ray check. <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> was ordered in custody for eight days by a <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> court on Tuesday, pending the completion of police investigations. Police prosecutor <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Charalambous </PERSON> told the court <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> admitted he had arrived in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> `` to commit a crime,'' but did not give more details. The bridge on Grivas Avenue is crossed by the main road from the capital of this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island to western and northwestern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. In October 1984, a car bomb explosion damaged the multi-story building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which was then in a different part of town. No one was injured. Responsibility for that attack was claimed by the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of killing <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last month as well as killing three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in a <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> car bombing last February.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says his decision to leave the ministry to run for president was right but he may return soon to his ailing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, according to a newspaper report today. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> and resigned his ordination as a Southern Baptist minister in September 1987 to campaign full time for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination. At the White House today, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> endorsed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and told reporters that he will officially withdraw from the race on Monday. Asked if he would run again in 1992 if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loses this fall, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied, `` It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.'' In his interview with The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said of the television network he formerly led, `` I ca n't abandon CBN It's too important to me. I've got to do everything I can to make sure that it's healthy.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the newspaper he likely would return to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> as chief executive officer, the title his eldest son, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, now holds. The senior <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also said he would appear on the air, probably as a news commentator. Asked when he might return, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` Very shortly. It's not too long. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has lost badly to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former candidate <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contests nationwide. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> has lost viewers and donors, laying off hundreds of workers. `` I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that they would be able to run <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> in my absence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I did not realize that my personal presence on ` The 700 Club' was as important as it is to the audience. `` I was able to do news analysis and at the same talk about spiritual things, and we've had a hard time getting a replacement for that, so the audience has dropped dramatically in the last year. That has, of course, impacted contributions.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said his return to the airwaves would not necessarily spell a return to `` The 700 Club,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship show and mainstay of the past two decades. `` It may be time to look for other vehicles to talk to the American public and the world public,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` ` The 700 Club' has been around since 1967 and that's 21 years. That's a long time for any television program.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hinted anew today at the worst kept secret of the Republican primary season: his support of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. In a sort of political tease for the formal endorsement <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will make tonight at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dinner here, the president, accompanied by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, walked into the Cabinet Room to waiting <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders. As they emerged, the lawmakers applauded. `` I just have very brief announcement to make and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign tonight,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president then walked over to the table, sat down next to vanquished Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and grinned widely as reporters tried to question him, saying at one point he had other business that needed more immediate attention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> smiled, walked to the other side of the table, and took his seat across from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A short time later, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement in a private meeting and said he would withdraw from the GOP race on Monday. `` I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race is pretty much over,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has won only 46 delegates in the Republican primary and caucus competition. `` I did n't ask anything for myself'' in the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said. `` I spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of 1988,'' he said. As <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was speaking to reporters just outside the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared with several aides on the second floor balcony of the vice president's office in the Old Executive Office Building, across the street, and waved. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he would work to get his supporters to back the vice president. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no assurances about specific issues. `` We definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` My feelings and his feelings were totally in harmony, that the 1984 document of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform is something we can all unify behind.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s blessing later in the day will be anti-climatic, since it comes two weeks after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won sufficient Republican convention delegates to lock up the party nomination. The president chose a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> meeting with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders to say he would complete the public endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tonight at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dinner here. The timing of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement had been the subject of high-level jockeying between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> officials in recent days, although there never was any serious question that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Two weeks ago, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked on the day after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primnary whether he was endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president replied that he thought the time had come for that, but that he was n't quite ready to do it. `` Let us see,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had steadfastly maintained from the outset of the Republican competition, early last year, that he would remain neutral until a nominee emerged. The president had said that as titular leader of his party, it would be inappropriate to do otherwise.

 A federal jury today convicted two admitted revolutionaries of armed robbery, racketeering and murder in a series of crimes that included two 1981 armored truck robberies that left two guards and two police officers dead. The jury found <PERSON> Mutulu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> each guilty on all eight counts. Both defendants face maximum sentences of life in prison for the convictions of murder while committing robbery. The charges against <ORGANIZATION> Shakur </ORGANIZATION>, 37, and Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, 40, included a string of robberies and attempted armored truck robberies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Among the robberies was the $ 1.6 million holdup of a Brink's truck in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north of the city A guard and two <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION> police officers were killed in the bloody aftermath of the Oct. 20, 1981 robbery. The pair also were convicted of a June 1981 armored truck robbery in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> in which a Brink's guard was killed. One of Shakur's defense attorneys, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, said the verdict would be appealed. Both Shakur and Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> remain jailed, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON> did not set a sentencing date. The bank robbery and racketeering convictions carry maximum 20-year sentences. The jury also found, by way of the racketeering conviction, that <ORGANIZATION> Shakur </ORGANIZATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> played key roles in the 1979 prison escape of black radical <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesimard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chesimard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leader serving a life sentence for the murder of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state trooper, escaped from state prison at <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and is believed to be living in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The defense had said that <PERSON> Shakur </PERSON>, who is black, and Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, who is white, are revolutionaries who were put on trial because of their political beliefs.

<TEXT>
 Legislation authorizing a bronze statue of a female Army nurse at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial was approved by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday over a dissenter's protest that the memorial might become a sculpture garden for special interest groups. Before the bill was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, it was amended to stress that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not approve any further additions to the memorial once a woman's statue is built. But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., was not satisfied He noted that a statue of three <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> infantrymen and a 60-foot flagpole already have been erected on the 2.2-acre memorial site near the Lincoln Memorial, and he predicted there would be further demands to recognize others who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., the committee chairman, said the bill specifies that `` this will be the last. `` But the last for how long?'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> retorted. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, alone among 17 committee members in opposing the bill, said that `` adding bits and pieces to this stark and dramatic memorial'' would destroy its artistic integrity. He made clear that his dissenting vote had nothing to do with his respect for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. The politically popular measure, introduced by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., with 63 sponsors, has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> But it is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, whose approval also is required before any new monuments can be built on federal parkland in the capital. At a committee hearing last February, the bill was applauded by veterans' organizations but criticized by <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the architect who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. `` I can not see where it will all end,'' she said. `` What is to stop someone from trying to add a female statue to the Iwo Jima Memorial?'' She and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the fine arts commission, said it might be more appropriate to build a separate monument to all <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who have served in the armed forces since World War II. Congress authorized such a monument in 1986. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON>, former executive director of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial Fund, warned that to add a woman's statue would `` open a <ORGANIZATION> Pandora </ORGANIZATION>'s box of competing and proliferating statuary to the ephemeral goal of literally depicting every possible subcategory'' that served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> already had received requests for statues honoring native Americans and scout dogs at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial. The memorial's black granite slab bears the names of more than 58,000 Vietnam War dead, including eight uniformed nurses. Built with $ 11 million in private funds, the memorial has become the most popular tourist attraction of any national monument in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The memorial, which was dedicated in 1982, has attracted an estimated 20 million visitors.

 Students from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> junior high got a lesson from the school of hard knocks when the agency that arranged their East Coast tour ran out of money midway through the trip, leaving them without cash for food, lodging or airplane tickets home. The 185 youth from <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> were able to continue their planned itinerary today, heading for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in buses, only after their school board agreed to pick up costs for the trip and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> donated plane tickets home. The youths' 38 teachers and parent chaperones pooled their cash Tuesday to stay the night at a lower-cost <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel after the travel agency that arranged the pre-paid tour `` just ran out of money,'' said principal <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, trying to oversee the situation from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know what the travel agency did with the money but it's gone,'' she said today. She said the school board voted Tuesday night to pick up remaining costs for the trip, estimated at $ 47,000, and would `` ask the parents to have some kind of fundraising activity ... they'll probably have to have car washes'' to help defray the costs `` The kids have been wonderful, a little bit teary-eyed and concerned, but now that they know that they can continue the trip, they're wonderful,'' she said.

He said he did n't know what had happened back at the travel agency, but that continuing the tour for the students was the top priority for now. `` The kids I do n't think have experienced any of the real heartache that some of us have,'' he said. <PERSON> Ewalt </PERSON> said the students boarded buses for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> early today and would spend the end of the week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before heading home on Saturday. `` I'm just making calls letting everyone know we're still coming,'' <PERSON> Ewalt </PERSON> said this morning prior to leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 When 3-day-old <PERSON> Brandie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> grows up, she'll have a fantastic story to tell about the day she was born. No doubt she'll tell how dad was arrested, handcuffed and taken to the police station for driving recklessly when he drove her mother to the hospital. `` It's not funny to him at this point,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, said Tuesday from Memorial Hospital of <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> `` He'll look back at it and laugh _ maybe later.'' At 5:45 a.m. Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> started having labor contractions. Mrs. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON>, 24, thought they had plenty of time for the 25-mile trip to the hospital. But, she said, every time she had a contraction, she yelled a little louder _ and her husband drove a little faster. `` Sure, I was driving faster than normal. But what else could I do?'' <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON>, 26, said Monday. When the labor pains became more frequent, <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> said his wife `` was screaming and, at one point, grabbing my hair as I was driving. I was afraid she was going to have the baby right there,'' he said. Police Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said Wednesday the couple was about a half-mile from the hospital when police noticed their car. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON>, they said, was driving about 50 mph, or 25 miles over the speed limit. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> cut off another driver while making a turn and nearly plowed into the back of a truck, police said. Shortly after the couple arrived at the hospital, Officer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> for his license. After admitting that he speeded, police said, <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> told <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> to take his license as bond and let him go inside. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> acknowledged he then `` got smart'' with the officer. He said he started to walk away but did n't get far. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> grabbed him, handcuffed him and took him to the station. Shortly before 7 a.m. _ a little more than an hour after he and his wife started their trip _ <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> was released; a police officer drove him back to the hospital. <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> ran into the delivery room just as 5-pound, 4-ounce <PERSON> Brandie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was born. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said `` his intentions from the very first were to write a warning,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>. `` But the guy talked himself into a ticket, calling him all sorts of vile names.'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said police decided a written warning was sufficient. After seeing his healthy daughter, <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> said, his anger subsided. `` At least, after all of this,'' <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Brandie </PERSON> will have a funny story to tell about being born.''

 An attacker jumped from a jeep today and shot to death a military judge who handles cases related to this nation's civil war. The jeep pulled up outside Judge <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s home, where the gunman approached his car and fired four shots, witnesses said. The attacker then rushed back to the jeep, whose driver was waiting, and escaped. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, 45, died at the scene. Most of the witnesses were neighbors, and they spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Past killings have been blamed on leftist guerrilla groups fighting for power since 1979 and on rightist death squads. But police said they had no idea who the attacker was. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was one of three military judges in charge of national security cases linked to the civil war, including people suspected of cooperating with the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Report Urges More European Responsibility in NATO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies should revise their joint defense compact to shift more of the financial and military burden onto the Europeans, a new study has concluded. The report by a panel of legislators and defense experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and eight European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member countries is a summary of conclusions from a yearlong study on the future of the Western alliance. The report, titled `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990s,'' is to be presented publicly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 18. Details were disclosed this week by sources associated with the study. The report says a new political mandate for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is needed to reflect a fundamental change in the relationship between <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The European members must take on more responsibilities in line with the region's increased economic strength and greater political cohesion, the report said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it said, is undergoing a major re-examination of its global role in light of massive budget and trade deficits that jeopardize not only its own economy but also the world economic system. As a result of growing European and diminishing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> clout, leaders from both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> should strike a new defense bargain, the report said. `` It's time for a better equilibrium'' within the 39-year-old alliance, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Corterier </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> advisory group of parliamentarians that sponsored the study. `` We feel it can not be denied that the relative weight of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has changed,'' <PERSON> Corterier </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. Pressure in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been mounting in recent years for the Europeans to bear a bigger share of the cost of defending <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> territory. A <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study published Tuesday said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends 6.7 percent of its annual economic output on defense, compared with 3.3 percent for non-U.S. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been predominant in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> since it was formed in 1949. This is because of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role as the nuclear guarantor of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security, as well as its traditional economic power. The report's conclusions do not call into question <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s official doctrine of relying on a mixture of conventional and nuclear arms to deter attack It says a substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as well as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear guarantee for the alliance, remains vital to Western security. Nonetheless, a new mandate for the alliance should be drawn up soon, preferably within a year after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January, it said. The mandate should reaffirm the standard <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> aims of pursuing arms control agreements with the Soviet bloc while maintaining a strong defense. But it should include the following additional elements: _ The European members should promise to intensify cooperation among themselves as a way of economizing in an era in which government defense spending is expected to be severely constrained _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should welcome a move toward greater European cooperation on defense matters _ All the allies must agree that future <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy matters reflect a progressively larger European influence The report also recommended: _ Creating, separately from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, a consultative body to coordinate policies on security matters outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> treaty area Membership would be open to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other non-NATO democratic nations. _ Lessening <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s reliance on short-range nuclear weapons and, by the 1990s, further reducing the number of nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The report rejected the Soviet aim of scrapping all nuclear weapons. _ Establishing a NATO-Warsaw Pact crisis avoidance center, which would bring together military experts and diplomats from both blocs to exchange information on military activities and seek to resolve low-level incidents involving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military personnel

 A federal judge today ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> did nothing wrong when it lifted a ban on shipments of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus to other citrus-producing areas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s ruling was in response to a suit filed by the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in an effort to keep <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit out of the state. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 11 lifted a 3 -LCB- - year ban on shipments of fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other citrus-producing areas The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker in parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the fall of 1984.

 At least 8,000 people marched today to demand that President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> allow her ousted predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, to return from exile to bury his mother. The march began after a military court sentenced the leader of a January 1987 coup attempt to 12 years hard labor. Late Tuesday, the court convicted a total of 106 officers and enlisted men of various charges in connection with the coup attempt, which the government said was aimed at restoring <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters marched at midday to the <LOCATION> Mendiola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, 300 yards from the presidential compound, where 200 riot police stood guard. The bridge was blocked by barbed wire and two water-cannon trucks. Protesters set off firecrackers and carried banners reading `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> regime - heartless'' and urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to leave his Hawaiian exile and return for the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>. Marchers chanted `` Bring Back Marcos'' and `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> government resign.'' Col. <PERSON> Emiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Templo </PERSON>, deputy capital region commander, estimated the crowd at between 8,000 and 10,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, 95, died May 4. Here body has been lying in state at a suburban church, and no date has been set for the funeral. Relatives hope Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will change her mind and allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to attend. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for the funeral, saying he threatens national security. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several coup attempts against the Aquino government. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after a civilian-military uprising toppled his 20-year administration and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration barred <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from leaving <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> without permission after the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government claimed he had chartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt succeeded. During the Jan. 27, 1987 attempt, hundreds of dissident soldiers stormed media and military facilities in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area, taking control of a few media facilities but surrendering about 60 hours later. One mutineer was killed. Late Tuesday, a military court sentenced the leader, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Canlas </PERSON>, and 10 others to 12 years imprisonment at hard labor. They were convicted of mutiny, illegal possession of weapons, being absent without leave and conduct unbecoming an officer. Twenty-nine other soldiers were sentenced to six years in prison and 66 received six-month sentences for being absent without leave. The trial lasted nearly a year.

 A woman who was wounded during a Christmas rampage by a gunman who killed 16 people testified today that she crawled along the floor and hid behind a counter after being shot in the mouth. `` I thought to myself, there is nowhere else to go, so I stayed quiet,'' <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolery </PERSON>, a market cashier, testified during the trial of <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47. Mrs. <PERSON> Woolery </PERSON> said identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> as the gunman and said she and <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had been co-workers at the market for 3 -LCB- years. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant, is on trial in the Dec. 28 deaths of former co-worker <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Four people were wounded during the shootings. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is to be tried July 18 in the deaths of 14 relatives, including his wife, children and grandchildren. The bodies were found at his home near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> after the shootings in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Police said the 14 were killed during the Christmas holidays. Mrs. <PERSON> Woolery </PERSON> testified that she did not know how many shots were fired because the incident happened so quickly and she could not distinguish gunshots from the noise made by bottles and cans that a customer threw at the assailant. On Tuesday, a witness testified that the gunman wore a `` horrid grin'' as he aimed his revolver at office workers during the rampage. The gunman stepped over the body of one of his victims, `` took a stance and pointed the gun at me,'' said <PERSON> Juli </PERSON> <PERSON> Money </PERSON>, extending her arms with hands clasped to show how the man held the gun. `` I screamed, ` No!' and dived behind some boxes,'' she said. `` He was grinning. He had a horrid grin that looked like false teeth and his eyes were wide open.'' According to police, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> used two .22 - caliber revolvers to kill <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, who friends say rejected <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' amorous attention, and <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, who apparently was a chance Police said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had a grudge against most of the people he is accused of shooting. <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> was shot in the right eye at point-blank range as he opened a door at <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after he and Ms. <PERSON> Money </PERSON> heard two shots fired in the office area, Ms. <PERSON> Money </PERSON> said. The gunman had already wounded the company president, <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>'s body, Ms. <PERSON> Money </PERSON> testified, that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> stepped over before aiming at her. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, who was shot in the forehead, also said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> fired with a grin on his face. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who had worked for <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, then went to a nearby law office where Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> worked and stood in front of her desk, according to another witness, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> returned to her desk a short time later and said, `` Can I help you?'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had his hands in his pockets but jerked his right arm up and started firing a pistol, Miss <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` He missed her at first,'' she said. `` She just stood there. He kept shooting. Finally, he hit her.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said in his opening statement Tuesday that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, a legal secretary, was shot at least four times in the head as she sat at her desk. About 60 spectators were present in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, including relatives of some of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' family members. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, 36, of <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, whose brother was among the dead family members, said, `` We've got our grief to deal with and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has got God to deal with.'' Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> replaced one juror with an alternate during a closed hearing. The judge said someone reported that the replaced juror said something derogatory about <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. The trial was moved here because of extensive pretrial publicity.

 Twenty-seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists studying the `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth inaugurated a year-long electronic seminar using personal computer terminals Wednesday. Researchers will use their terminals to send messages at any hour to electronic `` mailboxes.'' The messages can be retrieved at any time by other members of the seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The opening ceremonial exchange between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was timed to coincide with a two-day, face-to-face conference on global warming in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sponsored by the institute, the corporation, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental research organization headed by actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. The computer exchanges will be `` a lot more collegial than your typical international conference,'' permitting the informal sharing of tentative ideas, trying out of approaches and asking `` what if?'' questions, said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintzner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, one of the researchers taking part. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was host to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ceremonies. The electronic set-up is `` a workshop, I like to say,'' commented <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Loshchenkova </PERSON>, senior staff scientist of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> institute. One of the organizers of the electronic seminar, former astronaut <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweickart </PERSON>, said a real conference would take weeks to organize and would cost at least 10 times more `` for the same productivity.'' Last year, <PERSON> Schweickart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, retired president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeev </PERSON>, director of the institute in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, were blocked from using <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Macintosh computers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> considered that machine's graphics programs too sensitive to provide to a potential adversary. Climate scientists are big users of computer graphics because their results frequently take the form of global maps. The organizers decided to go ahead using machines compatible with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> personal computers, which have less advanced graphics capability than the Apple machines. But recently the export ban on Macintosh was lifted, and `` four or five'' have been taken to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for use in the program, <PERSON> Schweickart </PERSON> said. The electronic seminar is being supported by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The seminar also has free use of 1,050-word per minute satellite and land circuits of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> linking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Asked if the exchanges would be monitored by the two governments, <PERSON> Schweickart </PERSON> said, `` Who knows and, in part, who cares?'' The `` greenhouse effect'' refers to the buildup of gases in the atmosphere that trap heat normally radiated out to space. The most important of these gases is carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists generally agree that sometime in the next century the average temperature of the earth will be three to eight degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it is now.

The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the defendant, identified as <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON>, was accused of participating in the riots in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> and intentionally killing someone for `` hooligan motives.'' <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> is an employee of a pipe and tube plant. Ethnic violence broke out Feb. 28 in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> during a territorial dispute between <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Armenians had demanded that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an Armenian-dominated region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Armenian activists said Armenians living in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 20 miles of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, were hunted down by bands of Azerbaijanis. Soviet media have said 26 ethnic Armenians and 6 Azeris were killed. Officials said 200 people were injured. All those charged will be tried in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> by a tribunal led by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klokov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Pravda said. If convicted of murder, <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> could be sentenced to death and shot by a firing squad. Pravda quoted <PERSON> Zulfi </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Sumgait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as saying even petty crime has declined since the riots, but effects of the violence remain. `` Many families that left the city during those bitter February days have still not returned home,'' he said. `` We will be exact: more than 1,200 jobs at factories and institutions are still empty.'' <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON> said the jobs were being kept open because officials expect the people who held them to return. The unrest caused a `` bleeding wound'' that made a rift between Armenians and Azeris, Pravda said. It also declared that the trials will show `` who needed to sow hostility between the two peoples,'' a possible reference to official allegations of foreign involvement in the riots. Soviet media customarily accuse such Western media as the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> of trying to foment trouble among the many Soviet ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Conservationists Ask Americans To Stop Buying Ivory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservationists picked the National Zoo to launch a campaign Wednesday to discourage Americans from buying carved ivory, in an attempt to save the lives of African elephants. `` Most people do n't realize that ivory comes from elephants,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMeekin </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` They think it's like jade.'' Ivory is so precious that the foundation suspects that traders somewhere are hoarding it in the hope of a new price rise. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, author of the recent book, `` Elephant Memories,'' told reporters that today's price for raw ivory is $ 68 a pound, up from $ 2.40 in the 1960s. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of carved ivory are worth $ 20 million to $ 30 million a year. The foundation estimates that 95 percent of it comes from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, usually smuggled from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is an even bigger customer. The foundation estimates that the 800 tons of ivory sold in the world every year costs the lives of 80,000 elephants. Americans could save about 27,000 of those elephants by refusing to buy ivory rings and other trinkets, it says. The foundation calculates that the elephant population in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which may once have been as high as 3 million, was down to 1.3 million in 1979 and about 750,000 today. Though it does not see a threat to the survival of elephants, it predicts that the entire environment of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will change because of the reduction in elephant numbers. Mrs. <PERSON> McMeekin </PERSON> acknowledged that African governments, of which about 30 have elephants on their territory, oppose the campaign. `` I had a four-hour fight with the Zimbabweans the other day,'' she said. `` They do n't approve at all.'' She said African governments work hard to protect wildlife and understand that they lose money from tourists as it disappears, but they resent action from other countries. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, president of the foundation, said that is why the foundation opposes a bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban imports of ivory. It also disapproves another, which Mrs. <PERSON> McMeekin </PERSON> said is being drafted, that would put a tax on imports of ivory with the proceeds to be used to promote conservation. <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> said that could mislead purchasers into thinking they were helping protect elephants instead of promoting their destruction. Mrs. <PERSON> McMeekin </PERSON> said she avoids using words such as `` boycott.'' But she urged Amnericans: `` Do n't buy ivory.'' She estimated that about 80 percent of the ivory in this country is imported legally, though sometimes with the help of forged documents, but was originally taken in violation of the law in an African country.

<HEAD>Government Proposes to Make Islam State Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government introduced legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to make Islam the state religion of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The move sparked street protests and was denounced by opposition parties and women's groups. `` Like the water lily is the state flower, Islam shall be the state religion,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters before Prime Minister <PERSON> Maudud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> introduced the bill in the house. The bill was expected to pass easily because the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> holds 251 of the 300 seats. `` The government is trying to divide the nation in the name of Islam,'' opposition member <PERSON> Shahjehan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siraj </PERSON> said. `` Government seems to have some bad motives behind it.'' Witnesses and opposition leaders said at least 50 people were injured when more than 1,000 opposition supporters stoned six government-owned buses in downtown <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 105 million people are 85 percent Moslem, with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> minorities. The country has had a secular constitution since it won independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1971. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told a religious gathering in March that `` the day-to-day life of the nation must be guided by the tenets of Islam and the ideals of Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' `` This law will curtail the activities of the fundamentalists, who are gaining ground because of Islamic slogans,'' said a senior leader in <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The constitutional amendment is the first major bill to come before the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which was elected last March 3. Most opposition parties boycotted that election, and only about half of the nation's 48 million eligible voters cast ballots. Twenty-one opposition groups, which have been agitating since last November for the ouster of <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, pledged to oppose any attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to change the constitution. These parties, which have no seats in the house, contend Parliament does not represent the people. But <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> promised that the bill would not be rushed to passage. `` There shall be enough time for the opposition to speak on it,'' he said. `` The government will seek public opinion on the legislation,'' he added. Several women's rights groups have already held demonstrations against the idea of making Islam the state religion.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, acknowledging the obvious, endorsed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today and said he would drop his own candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on Monday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prepared to make his own formal endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> celebrated two more big primary victories over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television evangelist, conceded weeks ago that he had no chance to catch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said today, after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House, that he wanted to give his supporters a chance to win national convention seats during <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses this weekend in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, then would pull out. Asked if he would run again in 1992 if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loses this fall, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied, `` It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a teasing mood, told reporters today at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nearby _ `` I just have a very brief announcement to make, and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign tonight.'' Grinning, he declined to answer questions on the subject. The president is to announce what everyone already knows at a Republican dinner tonight. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cruised to barely contested wins in Tuesday's contests in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He already has a mathematical lock on the Republican nomination. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s showing in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> pointed to possible weakness in the fight to come this fall. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who dropped out of the Republican race almost two months ago, still siphoned off nearly a fourth of the vote. Even though he has mowed down all his rivals, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made weak showings in some farm states. With two more wins in his column, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to nail the Democratic nomination. According to the latest AP delegate count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 1,581 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 942. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> captured 254,206 votes, or 79 percent, to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 45,111 or 14 percent, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received 105,542 votes, or 63 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 43,134 or 26 percent, with 100 percent of the precincts in. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won all 37 of the delegates in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 18 of the 25 in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Exit polls suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was beginning to make some inroads into <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black support, which has been all but monolithic in contests to date. Only about 4 percent of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s voters are black, but about a third of them voted for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> voter polls on Tuesday indicated. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 24 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, one of his best showings of the primary season among white voters, according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, did well among Democrats in both states who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, which would bode well for him in a fall confrontation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And he was winning support across the ideological spectrum. `` Voters of different ideologies look at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and are seeing what they want to see,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` In a sense he's all ideologies to all voters.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 108,421 votes or 89 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, he had 137,229 or 71 percent to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 45,376 or 24 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had 10,273, or 5 percent, with 100 percent of the precincts in. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is spending most of this week in the capital, was heading off Thursday on a campaign swing to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. As the votes were counted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had already moved on to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which holds its primary on Tuesday with 45 Democratic delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to the state on Thursday, after a series of meetings with congressional leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were turning their attention toward <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, whose huge primary with its 314-delegate prize is less than a month away. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 contest _ the same day as primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ finishes off the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary season, and provides <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with his last real chance to show some strength before the Democratic National Convention, beginning July 18. `` I hope by the 8th of June we are at or closing in on the nomination,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he was attended a fundraiser Tuesday night. `` I'm working hard, vigorously and I hope successfully, to see if we can wrap it up.'' Even so, he was not discounting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strength as a rival. `` We're taking none of these primaries for granted,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` They're all very, very important.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s aides have indicated he will invest as much money and time in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as he can. `` The race is on and the race is live,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, even as he congratulated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on two more wins. `` We will take it all the way to the end ... I want the nomination.''

<HEAD>Groups Laud Bill Provide Quality Schooling for All 4-Year-Olds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent business group and the nation's two major teachers unions on Wednesday endorsed a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill aimed at making high-quality nursery schooling available to all 4-year-olds The so-called Smart Start program, proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., would provide money to supplement and strengthen existing early childhood education programs run by schools, community groups and others States and communities would share the cost. The bill reserves at least half the spaces in the program for poor children. Better-off families would be charged on a sliding scale. The Kennedy bill authorizes $ 500 million for the program in its first year, $ 750 million in the second year and $ 1 billion in its third year. `` We believe the time for this legislation has arrived,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chaired by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said preschool programs receiving money under the bill should not emulate kindergarten or grade school but should help young children develop and learn as individuals. They also said the federal government should set high training standards for preschool teachers in federally supported programs. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said the group of 250 academic and corporate trustees views the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill `` with considerable enthusiasm.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, retired chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Proctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, recommended merging <ORGANIZATION> Smart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> with the existing $ 1 billion Head Start program at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` It makes little sense to have two programs,'' he said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> also said he was concerned about the federal government's reliability in paying for the preschool programs Under the bill, states would have to put up 30 percent the first year; 40 percent the second; and 50 percent thereafter. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said states should have to pay 50 percent right from the start. `` History has shown that where the federal government takes on too big a role and the federal funding is later reduced, many programs die,'' he said in his testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> was formed to study ways to address pressing economic and social problems. Last fall the group released a study saying the nation should concentrate on helping poor children in their earliest months and years of life, including prenatal care and enriched preschool education.

 <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the homeless woman whose refusal to voluntarily leave the street ignited a battle with the city over the rights of the homeless, remained hospitalized Wednesday with an unknown ailment. `` <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is resting comfortably at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clare </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she was admitted yesterday for observation,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said in a statement. `` She is undergoing medical evaluation, and her condition remains stable.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who used the name <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> while living on the street, possibly suffered seizures, authorities said. But <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said her illness had not been diagnosed. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was the central figure in a fight between the civil liberties groups and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> over the constitutionality of a city program to remove mentally ill homeless people from the streets during cold weather. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been living on a sidewalk grate when she was picked up last October and hospitalized for psychiatric treatment against her will. She eventually won her release.

 Police have arrested a former congressional candidate on charges that he tried to hire a hit man to kill Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> for $ 5,000, officials said today. Officials arrested <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> on Tuesday and charged him with solicitation of capital murder, said District Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` He was doing it to make a statement. He wanted to get publicity,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> had mentioned other possible targets, including State Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, but decided on <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s name was mentioned, ... but for whatever reasons, whether it was that -LRB- <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> -RRB- was out of town or not a big enough name, he settled on Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>. He wanted someone at the local level, but with a national reputation,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he informed the mayor's office of the alleged plot, but did not recommend more protection for the mayor. <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> sought the 23rd Congressional District seat in 1982 as a Liberterian and told detectives he was now leader of a political extremists' group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said today that <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> is no longer a dues-paying member and is not on the party mailing list. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the state's investigation began about a month ago after <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted his office because an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent had talked to a man who wanted to assassinate a public official. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent gave the man the name of an undercover officer who worked for prosecutors. The two talked on the telephone, then in person for the first time on Tuesday, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` He wanted a patriot to carry out the execution,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` He was firm in his convictions and he wanted a hitman with the same resolve and same philosophy.'' All conversations with <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> were taped, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. He was arrested at a supermarket pay phone Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said that in <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>'s car officers found a .22 - caliber rifle with 12 live rounds and `` execution warrants'' with blanks to fill in names of public `` The above-named traitor or traitors are to be executed on sight,'' read the warrants. `` Each accused has given public proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is a traitor to the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution.'' <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> allegedly solicited `` this -LRB- undercover -RRB- officer as a shooter for himself and unknown associates,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Veltkamp </PERSON>, the undercover investigator for the <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office who posed as the hit man. The mayor said Tuesday that he never met <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> and does not recall receiving threatening letters from him. `` We get threats on a regular basis _ not always with a price. That's what makes this a little more serious,'' said <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the investigation is continuing and that he would oppose the suspect's being relased from jail. `` We got a dangerous man here. If he seeks out two hitmen he is determining his resolve to do something,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>'s home, is 18 miles southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

 A defense attorney in the cocaine smuggling trial of reputed Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> told jurors in closing arguments today that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s chief prosecutor must have attended a different trial. `` He was in a trial in which all the witnesses told the truth,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who wrapped up the government's final arguments minutes earlier. `` He was in a trial in which there was no cross-examination of the witneses. ... That was n't the trial that occurred in this courtroom.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, whom prosecutors said was a key member of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, is charged with bringing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980, paying bribes and making threats to use <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a private relay station Co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with smuggling conspiracy. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said a big inconsistency in the government's case was that the indictment claimed that all the cocaine was delivered to Colombians in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but the government's key witness, an American, testified that some of the cocaine was delivered to him. In his closing arguments, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> referred to trial testimony that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> used bribes, charm and threats to run a smuggling empire, and that for once <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was without such advantages. `` He can not buy his way out of a just verdict. He can not charm his way out of a just verdict. And he can not force his way out of a just verdict,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. A day earlier <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was waging a violent war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and viewed cocaine as a weapon. `` He's still at war,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> told the jury that has heard 22 weeks of testimony. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> viewed cocaine as a weapon against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prosecutor also said the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> was responsible for smuggling 19 tons into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and had earned $ 20 million. `` That is an example of Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s ` children' you saw in this courtroom,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. Several witnesses have testified that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> referred to cocaine loads as children. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> blasted defense arguments that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> had been used by convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> as well as contentions that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a legitimate businessman who wanted to develop <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay as a resort. `` There is simply no way the defense is plausible, credible or believable,'' the prosecutor said. `` A legitimate businessman does n't attract tourists with machine guns.'' The prosecutor said that to equate <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s drug organization to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s group of American smugglers was like `` comparing the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> to the Little League.'' `` The evidence in this case shows a trail of bribery, corruption, violence and personal debasement that has been created and fostered by Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>,'' he said. The jury likely will get the case Friday and begin deliberations on the 11-count indictment charging <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and racketeering. A separate <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> of being one of the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 After reading about the suicide of a financially strapped farmer, a security guard began spending his evenings at home writing a play to dramatize the plight of farm families. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s `` Foreclosure'' opens next week for a limited run at an off-off Broadway theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said he hopes the drama will be presented across the country. `` No one is a spokesman for the farmer, because farmers do n't speak much,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview `` Maybe the play could do that. It's suited to play in a field, in gymnasiums.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s play is based on the experiences of the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Waynesboro </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lenard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, whose farm had been in his family for five generations, killed himself 20 minutes before the land was to be auctioned in February 1986 to pay a $ 300,000 debt. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> reportedly hoped proceeds from his life insurance policy and a private land sale would settle the debt, but it was not enough. When the plight of his widow, <PERSON> Annabell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, was publicized, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenbright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> led a fund-raising drive to help the family. That drew the attention of, among others, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who contributed $ 39,000. Two days before Christmas 1986, the mortgage on the 705-acre farm was retired. `` I kept getting news clippings and cutting them out of the paper about farmers committing suicide,'' said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, 38. But it was Mrs. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s story that inspired him to write. `` I tried to show what it's like, what makes a farmer commit suicide,'' he said. `` Foreclosure'' does n't follow the Hill story exactly. In the play, for example, both husband and wife commit suicide, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> now lives in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>; her son runs the farm. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who has dabbled in theater before but never tried a major production, said he worked on the play for 1 -LCB- years. It will debut May 19 at the LaMama Theater, and run for three weeks. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who farms part-time in <LOCATION> Blairsville </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said he planned to present Mrs. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> with a signed copy of his play. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s story personifies for me the American farmers' condition,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said `` My hopes are that ` Foreclosure' will bring the urgency of the farmers' situation to the American conscience.''

 A developer was convicted today of taking more than $ 115,000 intended for the reconstruction of 61 houses that burned in a 1985 police confrontation with the radical group MOVE. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, charged with stealing money from various accounts intended for the rebuilding project, was convicted of stealing mobilization money, bond money, transportation expenses and unlawfully using workers paid by the city to work on a union hall. He was also convicted in a kickback scheme involving a drainage project at the neighborhood destroyed in the May 13, 1985 fire that killed six MOVE members and five children. The fire began when a police helicopter bombed members of the group who had barricaded a house to resist eviction. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was acquitted on charges he stole $ 85,000 for his own salary and for workers on the project. His former business partner, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, was found guilty of failure to make required disposition of about $ 90,000 and acquitted of theft by deception and criminal conspiracy charged related to the same amount. Neither <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> showed any emotion as the 31-count verdict was read to Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>. The jury deliberated about 6 hours before returning the verdict. `` I'm not going to try to say what won the case. I'm just very pleased,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>. `` He's not taking it very well. ... We thought it was a compromise verdict and a verdict that really did n't indicate that the evidence as we presented it was properly understood,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The two men are free on bail until Friday, when a new bond must be posted on their convictions. Bail was set at $ 25,000 for <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and $ 2,500 for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Sentencing is scheduled for June 15.

<TEXT>
 An appeals court has ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> does not have the authority to temporarily outlaw `` designer drugs'' as they hit the market. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday threw out the convictions of three men found guilty of distributing and conspiring to distribute MDMA, or methylenedioxymethamphetamine in 1985 and 1986. The drug's street name was `` ecstasy.'' The court said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General had not delegated his authority to the administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to designate the drug as a controlled substance. The opinion issued by Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boochever </PERSON> said that federal law governing permanent scheduling of controlled substances was altered in 1984 with an amendment that fundamentally changed the process for temporary scheduling. Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> dissented, saying, `` I believe the majority demands too much of the government's crime-fighting efforts in the face of an unambiguous delegation of responsibility by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I believe the plain intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was to establish an expedited system of review in order to criminalize the possession, manufacturing and distribution of newly-developed ` designer' drugs before they become public health hazards,'' he wrote. In July, 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator added <ORGANIZATION> MDMA </ORGANIZATION> to a federal list of temporarily controlled substances. Temporary scheduling, designed to take effect within 30 days of announcement to avoid lengthy public comment that could jeopardize public safety, expires after a year. It can be extended six months if the Attorney General has begun efforts to make it permanently illegal. The court did not make a finding that the Attorney General could n't delegate authority to place `` ecstasy'' on the emergency list.

 Students from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> junior high school got to continue their weeklong tour of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday after school officials and an airline came to the rescue when their prepaid tour went bust. The 185 youngsters from <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> had been midway through their trip Tuesday when the travel agency that arranged the tour left them without cash for food, lodging or airfare home. `` I do n't know what the travel agency did with the money but it's gone,'' said school principal <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> helping arrange a long-distance bailout. The youths' 38 teacher and parent chaperones pooled their cash Tuesday to finance one night at a lower-cost <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel after East @ West Travel and Tours of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> said the trip was being canceled due to a lack of money, Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Telephones at the agency went unanswered Wednesday morning. The youngsters continued their planned itinerary, heading for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in buses Wednesday, after their school board agreed to pick up remaining costs for the trip and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> donated plane tickets home. `` The kids have been wonderful, a little bit teary-eyed and concerned, but now that they know that they can continue the trip, they're wonderful,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` There was a little bit of time when they were worried,'' said tour director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewalt </PERSON>, an employee of the travel agency who added that he would see the youth through even though he was n't getting paid `` The kids I do n't think have experienced any of the real heartache that some of us have.'' <PERSON> Ewalt </PERSON> said he'd directed hundreds of tours for the company but `` this time we could sense that it was a little different.'' `` We just found that the money was drying up,'' he said. `` When it stops right in the middle, there's really nothing we can do about it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cajon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday night to pick up remaining costs for the trip, estimated at $ 47,000, and would `` ask the parents to have some kind of fund-raising activity. ... They'll probably have to have car washes'' to help defray the costs. <PERSON> Ewalt </PERSON> said the students would wind up the week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before heading home on Saturday.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a foreign policy resume that stretches from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the Great Wall of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but as he moves toward a fall presidential showdown his experience is proving more of a political handicap than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' inexperience The Republican vice president relishes describing the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor of <LOCATION> Massachusestts </LOCATION> as one who `` does n't know much about foreign affairs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clearly expects to overwhelm <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> whenever foreign policy is an issue in the fall campaign. Granted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has seemed ill at ease on foreign policy questions including the continued validity of the Monroe Doctrine against foreign intervention in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the use of nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But those seemed brief, mostly forgotten incidents compared to the incessant questioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receives about his role in the Iran-Contra affair and his knowledge of Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drug trafficking. And, it is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who will be haunted throughout the campaign by the words of his rivals for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, particularly former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> who once questioned whether in administration councils the vice president had been `` in the cockpit or ... on an economy ride in the back of the plane.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may yet prove correct as he anticipates that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of foreign policy experience will lead him into a damaging gaffe when they debate in the fall. `` I ca n't wait for the debates,'' said the vice president. `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter,'' he replied a week later when an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> high school student asked if it was true, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was charging, that the Panamanian general had been on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payroll. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would ask <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` What would you do about it? ... You can make a lot of unfounded criticism, but what's his suggestion? What's he going to do and do it in a way that handles the delicate Central American relationships that we're building.'' Maybe, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he ca n't wait to confront <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on questions like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and Iran-Contra. But it is equally clear that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is just as eager to raise those issues. What better way to defend his lack of foreign policy experience than by going on the offense against the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> resume. Hardly a day goes by that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor does n't raise the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter `` Who was dealing with him and why?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday. `` Were we paying him and if so why? I can tell you one thing: If I'm the president we wo n't be doing business with drug-running Panamanian dictators.'' Dealing with dictators is a fact of life in international relations, one accepted by most voters. But the involvement in drug-trafficking makes the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter a far more serious political issue. A pledge to wage a war on drugs was a theme common to the rhetoric of all presidential candidates, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic. That alone was recognition of the fact that voters were demanding to know what the politicians intend to do about a serious national problem. In 1984, Republicans were able to play back Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s jibes at <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> when they were battling for the Democratic presidential nomination It will be the Democrats' turn this time. They are sure to recall <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s comment on the Bush-Noriega matter, the day the former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet official ended his race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. `` I do think there's been less than forthright discussion of this issue by the vice president,'' said <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. He refused to elaborate, but the fact that he was secretary of state during the first two years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency made his comment particularly tantalizing. Equally useful to the Democrats would be the collected jibes of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the acerbic senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> who thrashed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Republican presidential caucuses and then saw his hopes of being the nominee buried on Super Tuesday. It was <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> who predicted Iran-Contra would be an issue for the Democrats in the fall campaign. And in case the opposition needed some help trying to describe the scandal, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> referred to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers `` peddling arms to the ayatollah while others hear no evil, see no evil.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> left it clear that one of the `` others'' was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 A fuel leak was found in the engine of a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> comuter aircraft that caught fire and crash-landed April 15 at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, injuring 19 people, investigators said. The leak occurred because an `` O'' ring was out of place in a fuel filter assembly, and the filter was n't seated properly, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The findings confirmed passenger reports of `` liquid streaming out of the engine,'' he said. `` An X-ray revealed that the ` O' ring was damaged and out of place,'' and a manual test also confirmed the leak, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, said investigators `` found exactly what we said the cause was'' and that it was `` not something Horizon had fixed, touched or been involved in.'' After landing, the twin-engine de Havilland Dash 8, with 40 people aboard, careened out of control and crashed into three passenger loading ramps. It came to rest against a terminal concourse. The crew and airport firefighters were praised for coolness under pressure and quick action in dousing the blaze. The turboprop engine, a 2,000-horsepower PW-120 manufactured at the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> plant near <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, was dismantled by investigators last week, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has asked airlines in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that fly the Dash 8 to check the fuel filter assembly. `` They have checked and everything is in order,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said it was possible the filter assembly on the Horizon plane might have been damaged during maintenance. `` Every time you remove a filter and put a new one in, ... if the cover is not on properly, a leak can develop because of the pressure,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. The filter assembly had been in service six or seven days on the <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane and was part of `` the fuel pump that had been taken straight from the factory and put on this engine,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` How it got in that shape, I do n't know.'' A check of other filter assemblies Horizon had in storage revealed a similar seating problem in one other unit, which was turned over to investigators, he added. Still unknown, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said, was how the fire ignited and why the plane went out of control when it made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff for <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Republicans said Wednesday their bruising primary had given Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> `` the strength to win'' against Democrat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrats remained divided by their fight to choose an opponent for GOP Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who was running in his first election after being appointed 14 months ago, defeated Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> by a bigger-than-expected margin Tuesday for the right to face <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, the ex-governor who swamped one Democratic rival. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> edged millionaire industrialist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> to grab the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for an unprecedented fourth term, and will face another millionaire, insurance executive <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, who had never before run for office. Also in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> easily won the Democratic nomination to a sixth term and will be heavily favored over his Republican opponent, state Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> at a unity gathering in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> on Wednesday, drawing cheers from party leaders as he placed a `` <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' sticker on his lapel. `` I learned a great deal from him,'' said <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who at 39 is the nation's youngest senator. `` Maybe he taught me too well.'' The four-term congressman, who had attacked <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> aggressively during the campaign, praised his rival and said that without the hard-fought primary `` neither one of us would likely have had the strength to win'' in November. That sentiment was echoed by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of communications and research for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Everybody would rather avoid a primary, but he got his political act together,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>. `` ... Had <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> won, a lot of <LOCATION> Karnes </LOCATION> people would have sat it out.'' But <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> has been running ahead in polls pitting him against either Republican in a state where 51 percent of registered voters prefer the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` The race will tighten up,'' she said, `` but <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> remains a popular figure, and against that you have an appointed senator who just came through one of the most bitter primaries that anyone is going to see.'' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said Wednesday his top priority was to `` bring our party together because we share the common goals of better jobs, improved schools and a balanced budget for our state.'' But talk of party unity held little appeal for <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON>, who finished second in a seven-man field. `` He bought this election fair and square,'' was the assessment from See, the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> Speaker who was outspent by <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> $ 1.8 million to $ 500,000. See had been the Democratic nominee in 1984. Here are the returns from the major races, with 100 percent of the vote counted in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and 99 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: _ <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> had 114,783 votes or 55 percent; <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> had 93,932 votes or 45 percent. _ <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> had 153,611 votes or 92 percent; <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer, had 13,996 votes or 8 percent. _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> GOP Governor: <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had 77,626 votes or 53 percent; <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> had 67,986 votes or 47 percent. _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democratic Governor: <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> had 128,593 votes or 37 percent; See had 93,435 votes or 27 percent; state Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> had 50,955 votes or 15 percent; Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> had 48,376 votes or 14 percent; the rest were divided among three other candidates.

<HEAD>Study Says Beef Fat Not As Bad As Experts Once Believed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major form of saturated fat in beef appears to lower cholesterol rather than raise it, so meat may not be as bad for the heart as many experts had believed, new research concludes. Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said his work suggests that people should be able to eat moderate amounts of lean beef without worry, although he believes they should stick with widely endorsed guidelines for cutting fat consumption. `` Beef is OK for most people in moderate amounts,'' he said in an interview. Other experts cautioned that his study, based on liquid diets given to 11 men, is too small and preliminary to be the basis for saying how people should eat. All 11 were healthy volunteers, aged late 50s to early 70s. The researchers cautioned that only men were enrolled in the study and that the findings might not apply to women. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> found that, contrary to widely held beliefs, not all saturated fat raises the body's supply of cholesterol. Instead, one type found in beef and many other foods seems to lower it, just as monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat does, while another kind found in beef raises it. If confirmed by other research, the finding means that food makers may be able to use the cholesterol-lowering saturated fat to create margarine that's more like real butter as well as healthy shortening for cooking. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said his work does n't imply that people can gorge on prime ribs or other fatty beef with abandon. But he says it appears that three-ounce portions of select-grade beef are reasonable, and people need not give up beef entirely to protect their hearts. The research was conducted by <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanome </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. It was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. Cholesterol clogs the arteries and leads to heart attacks and strokes. In an interview, <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> noted that Americans are already eating leaner beef than in the recent past. `` By removing the fat from beef, we can still maintain its quality and yet have very little fat,'' he said. `` Furthermore, the fat that remains, if we eat lean beef, does not raise cholesterol as much as we thought. So I think we can say that if beef is obtained in the proper way, it really should not be feared as a cholesterol-raising food.'' <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> is a past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and contributed to the association's dietary guidelines suggesting that people limit their total fat intake to 30 percent of total calories Saturated fat should be less than 10 percent of the day's calories. In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aging at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the latest research `` demonstrates convincingly'' that one form of saturated fat lowers cholesterol. However, they said people should still hold down fat consumption. `` This study should not change our chief dietary message to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public,'' they wrote. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` It's a nice little piece of work,'' he said, `` but it's not the basis for dietary recommendations.'' Fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of various fatty acids. Safflower oil, for instance, is high in oleic acid, which lowers the body's cholesterol levels, while palm oil contains high levels of palmitic acid, which raises cholesterol. Beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid; both are saturated fatty acids. Unlike polyunsaturates such as corn oil, saturated fats are solid when cool. In the study, men drank three liquid formula diets for three weeks each. They were high in palmitic acid, stearic acid or oleic acid. The researchers found that compared with using the high-palmitic acid diet, the men's blood cholesterol levels dropped 14 percent while they consumed stearic acid and 10 percent while on oleic acid. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said that 3 percent to 4 percent of the calories in the typical American diet are from stearic acid.

 A gangster was sentenced today to a maximum term of 27 years-to-life in prison for killing a Chinese-American journalist in 1984, an act he testified was ordered by the Taiwanese government. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-sen </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>, was ordered to serve the prison sentence for the murder of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> after he completes a 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Superior Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> rejected defense arguments for concurrent sentencing that a prosecutor said could have set <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> free in six years. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s widow also had asked the court for mercy, saying she was touched by <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>'s public repentance. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> called the slaying `` an act of political terrorism.'' <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>, 36, received 25 years to life for murder and two years for use of a firearm. Prosecutor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> will not be eligible for parole for 17 years and eight months. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> was convicted by a jury in March after admitting he gunned down <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> in the garage of the dissident writer's home in <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Oct. 15, 1984. He claimed he carried out the act for patriotic reasons, believing he was killing a traitor on order from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s government Wearing a red prison jumpsuit and manacles on his wrists and ankles, the short, stocky member of the infamous <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> gang smiled wryly as the sentence was explained to him by an interpreter in the packed courtroom. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> was a columnist for Chinese-language newspapers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and was killed just after publishing an unflattering biography of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-kuo </PERSON>, who died four months ago. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> had testified at <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>'s trial that before her husband's slaying, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government had started sending over former friends of her husband's to try to convince him to quit criticizing the government. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>, who is serving his heroin smuggling sentence at <ORGANIZATION> Lewisburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, is one of two suspected gunmen to be brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He pleaded innocent last June despite having admitted to the slaying at his 1986 federal drug trial, saying he was unable to get a plea bargain and wanted to tell his story for the record. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> was killed on orders from his gang boss and members of the Taiwanese government.

 A federal magistrate today recommended that Rainbow Family members be prevented from meeting this weekend in advance of a July gathering by thousands of family members. In a hearing Tuesday before Magistrate <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, health and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said the Rainbow Family's planned July 4 meeting in an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> forest could strain resources <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> recommended to U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON> in <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> that the group be restrained from advertising and organizing for the `` tribal council'' this weekend. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> will consider the recommendation Thursday. Attorneys for the group and the government may file arguments on <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s recommendation. He will hold another hearing Friday, a law clerk said. Family members will fight the recommendation and still plan to meet, spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Principle </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know who can stop this,'' he said of both gatherings. `` All our literature every year has said, ` Ignore any rumors of cancellations, regardless of source.''' Principle said no state has ever stopped the annual July gathering. At the Tuesday hearing, the forest service said the loosely knit group had not applied for special-use permits. Dr. <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> testified that a Rainbow Family convention the size of one in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last year that drew 17,000 people would strain drinking-water supplies and garbage collection abilities. Members of the self-proclaimed peace and environmentalist group gathered before the hearing on the federal courthouse steps to protest the possible prevention of their gathering. The group, which held its first gathering in 1972, has no headquarters and no membership list, said spokesman <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Wage, Price Freeze Extended After Government Fails to Get Credit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wage and price freeze that was scheduled to be lifted May 15 has been extended because the government failed to secure enough international financial support, a senior official said Wednesday. Vice Premier <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosavljevic </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that international support was crucial to ending the wage and price freeze imposed in November in an attempt to curb 170 percent inflation The <ORGANIZATION> Basel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION> has approved only half of an expected $ 500 million loan for debt-ridden <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Milosavljevic </PERSON> said. The money is intended as an interim loan to tide <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> over while it works out repayment schedules on other debts. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Basel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s action `` makes it impossible'' to implement what the government bills as a new package of market-oriented economic reforms, beginning with the lifting of the freeze May 15. The deputy premier said he expected the rest of the loan to be raised in about 10 days during negotiations with some unidentified European governments and with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an indication the freeze could be lifted then. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was hoping for fresh loans of about $ 1.4 billion and a rescheduling of $ 2 billion that matured for repayment this year on its $ 20 billion foreign debt. It hopes to sign an agreement this month with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on new credits and debt rescheduling. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> worked with the Yugoslav government on its undisclosed new package of economic measures, which are aimed at tighter wage control. <PERSON> Milanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Presidium, said the government wage and price freezes have yielded only partial results. <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, noted that exports had increased, creating a surplus trade balance, but `` inflation has not been curbed, wages continue to decline along with the standard of living,'' he said. Living standards have fallen by one-third since 1980, while unemployment has risen to about 16 percent, or more than 1 million people. Last year, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was hit by move than 1,500 strikes. About 4,000 construction workers were on strike Wednesday in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> demanding higher and more regular wages, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. `` The conclusion is that the crisis continues and deepens,'' <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON> stopped short of demanding that Communist Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> step down. On Tuesday, the parliament of the Yugoslav republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> joined the parliament of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> in calling for a vote of no-confidence in the Mikulic government because of its failure to deal with the economic crisis. The attempt to unseat the government in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> will be made during a May 14-15 debate in the federal parliament on its first two years in office. The Croatian move opened up a chance that the government could become the first in postwar <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the first in Communist Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to be forced to resign. According to parliamentary procedure, a simple majority of votes in both chambers is required to force resignation.

<BYLINE>Longstanding Aggressiveness, Impulsiveness Seen in Suicidal Teens
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study of suicidal teens clashes with the popular notion that teens often brood for weeks and give indirect clues before killing themselves, a psychiatrist reported Wednesday. `` That was very, very rare'' in the teen-agers studied, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, a teen suicide expert at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, the teen-agers most commonly had a long history of aggressive and impulsive behavior, oversensitivity and suspicion, he said. `` They were aggressive to others for years, and finally they were aggressive to themselves,'' <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Their most common trigger for suicide was getting in trouble at school, or with the police or the family, but not knowing what the consequences would be, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. He spoke at a session of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting Results of the research are still being analyzed, he said. The study focused on suicides of people age 11 to 19 in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area over two years. Of the 181 suicides, 142 or 78 percent were committed by males, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Whites accounted for 71 percent of the suicides, though they make up only 62 percent of the area's population, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Blacks were underrepresented with 12 percent of suicides and 20 percent of population, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Sixty-two percent of the suicidal young people were ages 15 to 18, with 14 percent ages 11 to 14, and the rest age 19. To perform `` psychological autopsies,'' researchers interviewed 142 families of suicidal teens. <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said half the male cases had shown anti-social or aggressive behavior, while only about 14 percent could have been diagnosed with major depression. About half the female cases showed depression alone or with anti-social behavior, he said. Less common than the teens who showed the long history of aggressiveness and impulsivity were perfectionists, who worked hard at school and showed rigid personalities, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Next came girls with untreated depression, and finally a small group of psychotic teens who had been treated, he said. The triggering factor of waiting for the consequences of getting into trouble suggests such teens were probably highly anxious, bordering on terror, when they killed themselves, he said. He told of one teen who had broken into a neighbor's home and been discovered by the neighbor. The homeowner threatened to tell the boy's father that night. The youth went home and shot himself. Another teen-ager, a perfectionist who worried about entering a new school as his family planned a move to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, killed himself the night before they were to leave, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. The study also found that about half the teens who killed themselves had a close relative or grandparent who had attempted or succeeded at suicide. That was much higher than the rate for a comparable group of youths who had not killed themselves, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. That hints at a possible genetic influence on suicides, he said, but it might simply be that the young people were imitating their suicidal relatives. Other studies have shown that people who killed themselves show biochemical abnormalities. The longstanding characteristics of impulsivity and aggressiveness in suicidal teens mean those are signals to get a teen into treatment, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.

 Officers and soldiers at two provincial army bases defied military discipline today, and two officers were arrested, the defense minister said. Gen. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> told a news conferece `` there were some signs of indiscipline'' at the two army bases, `` but they were immediately neutralized and the officers involved immediately changed their attitude.'' Earlier, a statement from the defense ministry said a coup attempt had taken place. Throughout the country, the media interpreted the events as an attempted coup against President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>'s civilian government. But in reading from a prepared statement at the news conference, <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> refused to admit that a coup attempt or a mutiny was involved. He also tried to minimize the incidents that occurred at dawn today, saying they were short lived and the rest of the army's 74 bases and installations were not involved. The general claimed the officers involved in the `` acts of indiscipline'' were fooled and disoriented by `` speculation and disinformation'' propagated by unnamed civilians. <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said two officers at the bases involved _ <LOCATION> Jutiapa </LOCATION>, 74 miles west of the capital, and <LOCATION> Retalhuleu </LOCATION>, 115 miles southeast of the capital _ have been arrested and are being investigated by military authorites. He did not identify them by name or rank. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, a lawyer and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was inaugurated in January 1986, replacing a military government that had taken power three years earlier in a palace coup. The government and military had been in agreement on one of the major issues in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, whether to resume peace talks with leftist guerrillas. <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> this year that the rebels first must abandon their weapons and said `` the army is very close to achieving a total victory.'' Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the civilian government and a succession of military or military-dominated governments for 27 years. The first round of peace talks ever held in the insurgency took place last October in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The government had been resisting rebel calls for another round. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said preliminary reports indicated that some military units were involved in a coup attempt but she had no details. She reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for civilian democracy in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> succeeded Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Victores </PERSON>, who took control in August 1983 from another military ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> <PERSON> Montt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> <PERSON> Montt </PERSON> came to power after young army officers staged a coup in March 1982 that overthrew the rightist government of Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The elections in November 1985 were the first in 16 years in which the military did not field a candidate. On Monday, the national police said gunmen fired at the house of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>, leader of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, over the weekend. The previous week, hand grenades were tossed at the homes of two men who served in the governments of <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> <PERSON> Montt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Victores </PERSON>. There were no claims of responsibility.

 With post-election maneuvering under way Wednesday in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration declined to speculate publicly about how the balloting will affect continued Danish participation in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` The results are somewhat inconclusive,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> have a long and close friendship and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government will continue to work closely with the government that is formed after the <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> have evaluated their election.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had been hoping Danish voters would elect parliamentarians opposed to a recently passed resolution that would make it impossible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships carrying nuclear weapons to visit <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. The resolution has raised questions about <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s continued membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> because nuclear deterrence is one of the bedrocks of alliance doctrine Tuesday's vote for 179 Parliament seats resulted in a modest shift to the right and strengthened the parties that give unqualified support to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, analysts there said. The future of the Danish nuclear resolution depends on whether Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> _ who does n't want to implement the policy _ is able to form another minority government. White House spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said `` we have an interest in the substance of the -LRB- nuclear -RRB- ship issue and expect to discuss it with the new government once it is formed.'' As the delicate coalition-bargaining unfolds in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is remaining noncommital about the situation, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made clear, however, during a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> late last month that he is disturbed by the possibility that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> might institute a ban on nuclear-armed ships. A similar ban enacted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> led to the demise of a three-decade alliance in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> asserted that <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> action to limit nuclear missions would hurt <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as well. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who has said his hand in dealing with the Soviets is strengthened by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> solidarity, said `` if you like the benefits, if you like peace, if you like the fact that progress is being made in negotiations, then you ought to like the responsibilities that go with making that possible.''

 A moderate Democratic group proposed on Wednesday a voluntary program that would link federal education, housing and job training aid to participation in civilian or military service to the nation. `` We believe that there is something relating to civic obligation that still should be a part of our national life,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` We seem to have lost that sense of involvement for something more than the individual in recent years.'' As outlined in the 66-page proposal, the `` <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>,'' would consist of young volunteers working one or two years at subsistence wages in civilian or military service to earn vouchers that could be used for college, vocational or job training expenses or to make a down payment on a home. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the vouchers would amount to $ 10,000 for each year of service and eventually would replace existing federal grant and loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to students. `` This would be a shift to saying that if you're going to get assistance from society for your education, then you're going to serve society,'' he told reporters. The proposal also calls for the enlistment of volunteers over age 65, who would be paid a modest hourly wage instead of vouchers. They would be used primarily to fill administrative and supervisory tasks within the corps. Under the plan, the corps would be administered by a small federal agency that would set broad policy and make matching grants to states and local governments and non-profit agencies, which would handle day-to-day operations. Federal grants would cover 75 percent of the costs. The total annual cost of the program, based on the enlistment of 800,000 volunteers, would about $ 15 billion. Of the total, $ 5 billion would come from new federal expenditures, $ 2 billion from local and state governments and non-profit agencies and $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion from existing federal grant and loan programs for education. Former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, past chairman of the leadership council, said the national service proposal is an attempt to `` move away from the politics of pure entitlement to some sort of system that involves mutual civic obligation.'' `` There are too many people focusing on purely tangible rewards and immediate rewards rather than a long-term sense of citizenship,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the program would focus the energies and enthusiasm of young people on the nation's social needs, such as fighting illiteracy, improving health care and drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and providing child care for working parents. At the same time, he said, it would strengthen military recruitment by providing a new manpower pool that would also be less expensive than the current all-volunteer force. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION>, composed of elected Democrats at the national, state and local level, is planning a series of forums around the country this year to discuss the national service idea and obtain reaction from young people. Legislation would be offered next year. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he has no plans to push for a national service plank in this year's Democratic presidential platform. But he said aides to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nomination, have discussed the proposal with council staff members.

 The West German doctor who performed the first known successful use of one liver split in two and transplanted into two patients said Wednesday that the procedure still is a method of last resort. `` I guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit higher. So I think it's a step forward, but it's only a step forward if one can not manage the donor problem,'' <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hannover </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Exasperated by the shortage of donor organs, European surgeons have begun dividing livers and grafting the parts into different patients, a development hailed by other transplant surgeons when it was reported at a conference here Tuesday. `` It could double the donors,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967. `` If you have patients who are terribly ill and in equal need, it's one way out.'' `` It's an important step forward,'' agreed <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brousse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> reported at the conference here on liver disease that he had no choice May 1 but to divide the liver of a 40-year-old man for two women, both near death. Both parts of the organ have since functioned well, although one woman is critically ill from kidney and lung complications she suffered before surgery, according to <LOCATION> Bismuth </LOCATION>. The liver is the only human organ that can regenerate itself. In splitting a liver, surgeons divide it by its two main groups of blood vessels, but a common artery and bile duct must be carefully divided, and one half can be weaker than the other, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> performed such an operation Feb. 2, believed to be the first successful attempt at split-liver transplantation in the world. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about 450 people are awaiting liver transplants, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Transplantation. About half of them are children. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said he, like <ORGANIZATION> Bismuth </ORGANIZATION>, was desperate to save two patients' lives but had just one liver. As a result, he transplanted the halves of a 23-year-old man's liver into a 2-year-old boy and a 63-year-old woman. Both recipients are home and doing well, said <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON>. `` I can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we have the appropriate setting,'' <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said. `` We have to take all the maneuvers to get more livers, particularly of course for the smaller children,'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. `` I have many patients waiting and many children waiting and too few donor organs.'' Doctors have been trimming livers for several years to make them fit properly, particularly for children. `` It's of course a pity to throw away the other half of the liver,'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said the one-year success rate is about 50 percent to 60 percent for children who receive reduced-size livers, compared to 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ.

<HEAD>Mixed Reception Seen for Next Wave of 20,000 Cubans a Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thirty-six bleary-eyed Cubans arrived before dawn Wednesday to tears and hugs from relatives, but they and 20,000 other Cubans coming to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> this year face a more uncertain reception from the rest of the city. For some residents, concerns stem from memories of escalated street crime after the 1980 Mariel boatlift; others, particularly <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks who feel their economic and political opportunities will shrink with the rising <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> population, also are concerned. And government officials fret about the financial costs of the new immigrants. `` It's a shame people tend to remember only the bad parts of Cuban immigration, but the truth is that most Cubans have gone on to be some of our most thriving citizens,'' said City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON>, a Cuban-American. Officials are quick to note that the new, carefully screened <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants, who began arriving by the hundreds this month, have little in common with the 125,000 who came ashore when <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> opened the port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> _ and his prisons _ for six months and ignored <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration pleas for controlled immigration. `` Not only have they been through a rigorous procedure by federal immigration officials to ensure their financial stability, but most will initially be living with relatives here _ that's a support system the bulk of the Mariels never had,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON>, refugee affairs coordinator for <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Unlike most other immigrant groups, Cubans have chosen one city as their own. More than 80 percent of the Cubans coming here since <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s 1959 revolution stayed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. They have overtaken non-Latin whites, called `` Anglos,'' and make up 42 percent of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 1.86 million people as the largest group. Cubans dominate <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> politics, economy and society and transformed a tourism-based southern city into a modern, Latin-oriented financial center. Still, simmering resentment flared in the years immediately following <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s uncontrolled `` Freedom Flotilla.'' A minority of hard-core criminals helped push <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> atop violent crime statistics and that lawless image was spread with a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> remake of `` Scarface,'' starring <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> as a Mariel cocaine kingpin. Thousands were placed on the public dole, and state and local governments still are seeking federal reimbursement for $ 150 million in services spent on the refugees. In 1980, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents expressed a backlash by passing an anti-bilingualism ordinance, and continued resentment by the remaining non-Latins often surfaces on radio talk shows and other forums. `` Cubans already here would like to allow any Cuban to come over here and live in liberty _ but you have to draw the line somewhere,'' said WNWS radio talk show host <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantel </PERSON>, who roused attention with his proposed referendum to put a cap on public spending for refugees. Black leaders have protested every new influx, fearing Cubans will further dilute black political and economic power. `` From day one they're competing for the same jobs as blacks,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, publisher of the black-oriented newspaper The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need more Cubans like we need the plague.'' The basis for the new immigration is an agreement signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in late 1984, only to be suspended by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> five months later after the start of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. That pact was revived seven months ago when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to take back about 2,500 <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> _ a move that sparked riots and hostage sieges at federal detention centers in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> then opened its doors to 3,000 political prisoners and the annual flow of 20,000 immediate relatives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. The 36 former political prisoners and their families, who arrived in a regular chartered flight at Miami International Airport from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> Wednesday, were part of another group of some 400 political prisoners and relatives whose release was secured from the Cuban government by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Cubans are being issued 40 to 45 visas a day and the immigrants are allowed to travel by any means they desire anytime within four months of the visa, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At that rate, about 250 arrivals per week are expected this month and as many as 350 a week are expected by summer's end, she said.

<HEAD>Trip to Comedy Club May Result in New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A defense attorney found nothing funny about a group of sequestered jurors taking in a show at a comedy club the night before they convicted his client of murder. The night out, in apparent violation of the judge's order, could lead to a new trial _ the third _ for <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who was convicted of paying a man $ 800 to kill his father in 1981. Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> appealed the case to the 1st Court of Appeals. After a hearing Tuesday on the appeal, State District Judge <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he will urge the appellate court to deny a new trial. Bailiff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said he `` basically did n't realize I was doing anything wrong'' when he took eight jurors to the Laff Stop nightclub last Aug. 19. <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> noted a transcript that quotes <PERSON> James </PERSON> saying: `` Mr. <PERSON> Bailiff </PERSON>, do n't let the jury separate other than for purposes of going to the hotel and -LRB- their rooms -RRB-. They are not to separate at any other time.'' Five jurors testified that <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> told them they could stay at the hotel with another bailiff or go to the club. The eight who went with <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> watched two comedians and a hypnotist and ran up a $ 39.15 bar tab. While the hearing mostly concerned the violation of <PERSON> James </PERSON>' order and whether the night at the club may have affected deliberations, <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said the liquor bill launched the fuss. `` This has escalated and been blown all out of proportion,'' he said. `` It's always been my understanding that on a sequestered deal, jurors can have drinks or wine with their meal.'' `` This is highly unique, but nothing happened that affected the defendant getting a fair trial,'' said Prosecutor <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. She and <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said they know of no other sequestered jury being taken to a club for drinks. `` It's not a laughing matter,'' <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Can you imagine the defendant sitting in his cell with his head hanging wondering what the jurors will decide on this case and on the other side the jurors are out boozing it up at a club being hypnotized and laughing it up?'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>, 53, was shot twice in the back Oct. 12, 1981, as he walked across a parking lot with <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>. She testified last year she had affairs with both the father and son. The man believed to have fired the shots committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 40, is serving a life sentence on his second conviction of murder. His first conviction was reversed because his lawyer, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, was excluded from being present while detectives were taking <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s confession.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with 7 banks raising prime; Wall
Street reax. Pickup 3rd graf, `Many economists...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least seven of the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime lending rate a half percentage point to 9 percent Wednesday, the first increase since just before the stock market crash in October. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was the first to announce the increase and was quickly followed by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Other big banks also were expected to increase the key rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate on loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including home-equity loans. The impact was felt on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down about 44 points to the 1,959 level by midafternoon. Many economists had predicted an increase in the prime rate, which often lags behind rising interest rates elsewhere, because the cost of borrowing for banks themselves has been rising in recent weeks. The higher borrowing costs reflect a fear of higher inflation, which has been fed by evidence that the economy is growing faster _ especially figures reported by the government last week that showed unemployment had hit a 14-year low. These inflation worries have led the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, to nudge short-term interest rates higher. For example the federal funds rate, the overnight interest on loans among banks, has risen above 7 percent, compared with around 6.6 percent less than two months ago. The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, when it went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate dropped back to 9 percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stock collapse. It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and fell to 8.5 percent Feb. 2.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rode high-speed trains being tested for use between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of failing to promote such service and `` spending the last eight years without a national transportation policy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, one day after widening his delegate lead with primary victories in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser Wednesday night. He was to meet with congressional leaders and attend a luncheon with Latin American ambassadors Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and also scheduled a meeting with Anglican Bishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> before heading west to campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor rode to <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, aboard a Canadian train and back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on a Spanish-made train. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during the 32-minute ride from downtown <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> 50 miles south to downtown <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, said a lack of White House support for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and high-speed service had caused the nation's skies to become dangerously overcrowded. He said air shuttle traffic between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could be reduced by using high-speed trains that could travel between the cities in about three hours. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has pushed for the service as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>, which arranged the test runs, said the equipment needed for hourly service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would cost about $ 200 million and could be financed through a 10-year lease-purchase plan. `` That is a very, very modest investment for what could be and should be a profitable service,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we have been spending the last eight years without a national transportation policy.'' Accompanying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the trip were dozens of reporters from national and international news organizations covering his presidential campaign. He was to pick up Secret Service protection for the first time Wednesday but agents were not with him during the train rides. The reporters also took a brief subway ride with the governor from <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> station, a downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> subway hub, to South Station, a subway stop that also houses the city's <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> depot and served as the departure point for the high-speed test. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said there had been a 20 percent increase in ridership since 1982 on the state's major public transit system. He occasionally uses the system to travel to the Statehouse from his home in suburban <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. The high-speed trains tested Wednesday use tilt-car technology, allowing them to take curves at speeds up to 25 purcent faster than conventional trains. A three-hour trip time to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would be 90 minutes faster than current <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> service.

<TEXT>
 A travel group predicted Wednesday that Americans will set new records in travel this summer, with the majority taking a car, truck or camper to a vacation spot less than 250 miles from home. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, in its annual projection of summer vacations, said the Southeast will remain the most popular destination, while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> regions, which are in the midst of an economic recovery, will generate the biggest increase in vacation travelers. Cities, the data center said, will edge out oceans and beaches this year as the preferred destination. `` The economy this spring is much better than we expected after the stock market crash,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, director of the data center, `` and we're finding that summer vacation intentions are stronger than last spring.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the traditional summer vacation _ `` where the parents take the kids on a three-week summer vacation'' _ is no longer the model for many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households, where more women work and have less time to take long trips. `` We're finding that people are taking more shorter trips throughout the year and not just one long summer vacation,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. It estimated that Americans will take 136 million vacation trips during June, July and August, up 3 percent from the 132 million trips last summer. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the 1987 travel rate was a record. The average trip will last six nights, and an estimated 83 percent of travelers will use a car, truck or camper to get to their destination, the center said. Another 13 percent will go by plane, while the rest will take a bus or train or had n't decided how they will travel. The travel center projects that 51 percent of the summer vacation trips will total 500 miles or less round-trip, 23 percent 500 to 1,000 miles and 26 percent more than 1,000 miles. The average round-trip distance, the center said, is expected to be 870 miles. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the figures do not take into account international travel. The travel data center, a private, non-profit group that promotes travel, developed its forecast from the results of monthly telephone interviews of 1,500 adults. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the margin of error in the survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points. The center, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, has been conducting summer vacation surveys for seven years. The survey showed about 40 percent of the summer travelers will stay with friends and relatives and another 40 percent in hotels or motels. The rest will stay in a camper or vacation homes. The center found that nearly a third of those responding to its survey _ 31 percent _ said they planned to visit a city, while 26 percent said they would go to an ocean or beach. That is exactly the opposite of the results for the 1987 survey. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said one explanation for the popularity of cities this year is that people from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> tended to favor cities over beaches as vacation spots, and that region is projected to take nearly 9 percent more vacation trips this year than last. The center expects residents of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> region _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ to show an even bigger increase in vacation trips this year: 13 percent. It attributed the expected rise to `` economic improvement and pent-up demand for travel'' in the region. As for other regions, the center projects a 3.8 percent decrease in vacation trips by <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> residents, a 3 percent decline by Southeast residents and a 3.7 percent increase in trips by residents of Western states. The expected declines in vacation trips by <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> residents this year follows a big increase last year, the center said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the most popular cities to visit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The single most popular destination is the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he said.

<HEAD>GAO Faults Quality Assurance Efforts by Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Government efforts to make sure <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients receive good health care are hampered by poor coordination, questionable information and a lack of treatment standards, a congressional investigative agency said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it `` found reasons for concern about current systems for monitoring'' the quality of care given the Medicare program's 31 million enrollees. The government spent $ 70 billion on such care last year. In a report, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said review methods of `` uncertain validity'' are being used and problems identified by one set of reviewers are not coordinated for action by others. Further, it said, `` the accuracy of key information -LRB- generated by reviews -RRB- is questionable'' and the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION>, does not have an adequate long-term strategy to improve its overall Medicare monitoring system. Any future strategy should include setting minimum standards of clinical practice and testing incentives to get doctors to follow them, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. It recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., consider proposals to assign quality-assurance responsibilities to a new or existing federal entity Stark, who requested and released the report, said he would use it `` to look at whether we need to develop legislation to make sure we get good quality care for the nation's retirees.'' `` Right now we do n't know if we're getting quality in the medical care <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is paying for,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report makes clear that <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> does n't have a strategy for finding out how to know quality care when we see it, or if we did, to make sure <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is receiving it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> is a part, was quoted in the report as agreeing with all or most of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations. The report said the agency opposes creation of a new federal entity to develop quality assurance methods but would consider improvements in internal coordination.

<HEAD>Tass: Founders of Rival Political Party Hamper Kremlin Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency on Wednesday called the founders of a new Soviet political party liars and scandalmongers whose actions hamper Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive. It the first attack by the state-run media on the new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> accused members of `` slanderous, anti-social activity.'' The toughly worded dispatch indicated that officials would not tolerate any challenge the new party might mount to the ruling Communists. Past attempts to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been crushed. About 70 people met Monday outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to create the new party, which seeks multi-party elections, independent trade unions, a new constitution and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and areas seized by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> expressed the hope that if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is serious in his campaign for a more open society, he will allow the party to seek supporters and take part in elections, which are tightly controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s platform was a `` provocation with a political flavor'' that was so anti-constitutional it touched off arguments among group members and exposed its authors to criticism from the group itself. `` The group is nothing more than a bunch of scandalmongers deliberately smearing honest people and hampering perestroika and efforts to foster good relations between people,'' the Soviet news agency said. `` Perestroika,'' which means `` reconstruction'' in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, is the name given to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious reform program for economic and social restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say why the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Declaration of Principles'' was unconstitutional, but the 1977 Soviet Constitution enshrines the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power, calling it the `` leading and guiding force'' of the country. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also defended the jailing of <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, the founder of the independent human rights journal `` Glasnost,'' who was arrested Monday. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, had offered to let the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> group use a country cottage outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he rents for their Monday meeting. But police surrounded the building, arrested <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> in the yard, and broke down the cottage's doors to arrest others, associates of <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference Tuesday. The Tass account of <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>' arrest said: `` On May 9 ... he kicked up a violent row on a trip outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and has been sentenced to seven days in jail by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramenskoye </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> region.'' <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, was convicted on a charge of resisting authorities. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON>, a fellow editor of `` Glasnost'' who was also detained at the cottage but later released, said <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> had been falsely accused. Lawyer <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelisyenko </PERSON>, who also spoke at the dissidents' Tuesday news conference, said police had no arrest warrant for <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> or any of the others arrested and had search warrant to enter the cottage

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned their campaigns west on Wednesday toward final primaries in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, both firmly in command and focusing on the fall. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a move that surprised no one, was bestowing his official blessing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The lone remaining Republican opponent, television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, bowed to the obvious at last and offered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would drop his own candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on Monday, weeks after he had ceased active campaigning against the vice president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose support of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was never in doubt, planned the formal endorsement of his vice president at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He delivered a political tease of sorts when he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked into the Cabinet Room to meet with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders. `` I just have a very brief announcement to make,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign tonight.'' With two fresh primary wins in his column, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took a high-speed train ride and denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not supporting rail service. `` One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we have been spending the last eight years without a national transportation policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with a mathematical lock on the GOP convention, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the Democratic nomination, were both flying to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Thursday to begin campaign swings. Both planned visits to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ahead of Tuesday's primary there, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which ends the primary season June 7 along with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and shook off resounding primary losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appeared before reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and said he had given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement in a private meeting and would get out of the race. `` I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race is pretty much over,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who won only 46 delegates in a campaign that spent more than $ 20 million. He said `` I did n't ask anything for myself,'' and promised to work to have his supporters back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked if he would run again in 1992 if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loses this fall, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: `` It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he soon may return to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the presidency. He said contributions and viewers have dropped dramatically in the last year. `` I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that they would be able to run <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> in my absence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Virginian-Pilot and <PERSON> Ledger-Star </PERSON>. `` I did not realize that my personal presence on ` The 700 Club' was as important as it is to the audience.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, rode two high-speed trains being tested for use between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for what he said was no national transportation policy and a failure to support <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. He rode the trains from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and back, a 50-mile one-way trip that the train covered in 32 minutes. He said equipment needed for hourly service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would cost about $ 200 million. `` This is a very, very modest investment for what could be and should be a profitable service,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to about 1,800 students at the predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. He exhorted them to reject drugs and violence, and afterward led a 15-block anti-drug march from the school through one of the city's most crime-ridden areas. `` You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of your life, and you can make a difference,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted he was in the race until the end, despite two more landslide wins by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Tuesday night including a delegate shutout of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has moved within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to nail down the Democratic nomination. According to the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 1,589 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 944.

 A man who pursued his estranged wife for two years, then shot her 13 times and stuffed her body in an oven, was sentenced Wednesday to 28 -LCB- years to life in prison. A jury found <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> guilty in February of the murder in February 1987 of <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> in her <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> apartment. He was also convicted of attempted assault on a friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> who was in the apartment moments before the killing. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> entered his wife's apartment from the fire escape and attacked her and the friend as she spoke to her mother on the phone. She shouted, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, you're a murderer!'' her mother said. Their three children were asleep when he came in and did not see him. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Colabella </PERSON> imposed a 25-year to life term for murder and a 3 -LCB- - to seven-year term for the attempted assault conviction _ both the maximum _ and ordered that they be served consecutively. <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> says he is innocent and will appeal. The murder occurred one day before <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> was due in court to answer a charge that he had violated a judge's order of protection barring him from contacting his wife, who was divorcing him. According to prosecutor <PERSON> Jeanine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> pursued his wife for two years from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, repeatedly threatening her.

 About 4,000 construction workers demanding higher wages were on strike Wednesday in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The strikes began Tuesday when 1,000 workers stopped work in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, capital of the southern region of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The workers were demanding pay raises of 100 percent. Most make about $ 50 a month. <PERSON> Izet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheku </PERSON>, trade union president in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, informed the strikers about an economic recovery program of their construction company. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said most workers greeted the news with applause, but a few taunted <PERSON> Sheku </PERSON> that `` you promised us a lot before but nothing was realized.'' The workers protested excessive bureaucracy and organization in the company without any decision taken on whether to continue the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said the number of workers on strike in and around <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorest region, rose to 4,000 Wednesday. About 2,000 textile workers of a textile plant in <LOCATION> Djakovica </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> town, went on strike a week ago demanding higher pays before they were accomodated. In 1987, according to official estimates, there were more than 1,570 strikes in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> involving some 365,000 workers.

 A federal judge on Wednesday blocked <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials' attempt to keep fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus out of the Lone Star State. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> followed the law in February when it lifted a 3 -LCB- - year ban on shipments of fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus to other citrus-producing areas <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated; they claimed the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> did not allow adequate time for comment when it lifted the ban. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s ruling was in response to a suit filed by the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in an effort to stop shipments of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit into the state. `` With all the information put before me, I am satisfied that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> followed the law in promulgating the rule,'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other citrus-producing areas. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker there in August 1984. Canker can damage the plants and cause lesions on the fruit or make it drop prematurely. After the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> lifted the ban, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> issued a 30-day emergency quarantine. Then on March 9, officials of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> attorney general's office and <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> sued, contending the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> violated its own rules in lifting the ban without allowing a period for comment <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus producers contend that an outbreak of canker would devastate the state's $ 65 million citrus industry; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials have maintained that the canker is under control and the threat to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is minimal.

<HEAD>China Suspends Fireworks Exports After U.S. Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 26 million defective or mislabeled fireworks have been seized in a federal crackdown that reportedly has led <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to suspend export production of firecrackers. More than 100,000 cartons of Chinese fireworks awaiting shipment were recalled and production of fireworks intended for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was halted in April, until quality control can be improved, sources familiar with the Chinese fireworks industry said Wednesday. The sources spoke on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanchen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he had no information on the report. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, head of the importing company <ORGANIZATION> Hop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pyrotechnics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was out of town and not available for comment, his office said. But officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> comfirmed that more than $ 2 million worth of imported fireworks has been seized in recent weeks in a joint operation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. That operation concentrated on imported products arriving at customs offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C.. the safety commission reported Mislabeling and overloaded fireworks were the most common problems cited by the agency, which seized more than 15 million `` Thunder Bomb'' firecrackers containing between 72 milligrams and 84 milligrams of powder. Federal law limits firecrackers to 50 milligrams. The crackdown does n't mean there will be no Fourth of July fireworks, agency officials added. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, for example, some two-thirds of the imported products passed inspection and were allowed into the country. The effort does represent a shift in emphasis from inspecting retail dealers to trying to stop problems before they are widely distribued, according to <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. `` We have taken enforcement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government safety standards from the roadside to the dockside in an effort to be more effective,'' <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> said Tuesday in a statement in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> where he announced `` Midwest Thunder,'' the joint Customs-CPSC operation in that area. The effort combining the work of the two federal agencies will give taxpayers `` more bang'' for the dollar, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. Officials predicted the effort would lead to the availability this year of safer firecrackers. In 1987 more than 9,000 Americans were injured by fireworks seriously enough to require hospital treatment, the safty agency said. Seized fireworks can be returned to commerce and sold if the problem is repaired, such as improving the labeling and warnings, according to officials. Products that can not be fixed are destroyed, they said.

 A man arrested for allegedly running a multimillion-dollar cocaine operation adopted the lifestyle of a cocaine kingpin played by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> in the movie `` Scarface,'' authorities said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>, 24, was taken into custody Tuesday at his $ 760,000 house on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> by police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. A silver <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> worth $ 121,000 was parked in the garage at the <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> house, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> bought as many as 19 luxury cars with drug profits, police said. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> apparently also used neighborhood businesses he owned to launder money from his cocaine operations in the city and in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> used the name <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>'s character in the 1983 movie, authorities said. `` His favorite movie was ` Scarface,''' said Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> of the Queens narcotics squad. `` He tried to model his existence after that character.'' <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> allegedly employed nearly 100 street-level dealers and pushers in a 2-year-old heroin and cocaine network based in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> but also flourished in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to a criminal complaint obtained by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. Two locations in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and homes in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were searched. Authorities also seized a bar, a grocery store and a sporting goods store, all named `` Tony Montana'' and owned by <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>. Only a small amount of drugs was found during Tuesday's arrests, <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said. Authorities, he added, were mostly looking for records and documents that would describe <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' organization and perhaps lead to more arrests. `` We believe taking this organization down dismantles a major flow of narcotics into this area,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> described <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' operation as a `` multimillion-dollar organization'' but he refused to say exactly how much money it made. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> was not linked to the drug-related violence that led to the death of police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was gunned down Feb. 26 while protecting the home of a witness, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> faces federal charges of conspiracy and possession and distribution of narcotics.

 A former hostage said Wednesday that he and two other Frenchmen were freed by captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because the public pressured <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and he urged Americans and Britons to do the same. `` I do n't understand the Americans and the British,'' said journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>. `` I have the impression that they have abandoned their hostages. But these men are suffering, and what is to be done has to be done very quickly. It is urgent,'' he said. Outgoing Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> thanked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for its help in freeing the French hostages. He said the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> had intervened to get them out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and announced that diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, broken last July, may be reestablished. Nine Americans and three Britons are among the 18 foreigners still held captive by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British governments have said they will not negotiate with terrorists. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> spoke to 250 reporters, a former American hostage and relatives of hostages at a packed news conference in a <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> theater. `` There was a consensus among the French that they wanted to free their hostages, and they supported what their government did to get us out,'' he said. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 44, and diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, 64, and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, were freed May 4 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They had been held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad for three years. Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> oversaw negotiations that led to their release. A fourth French hostage, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, died in captivity. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said he believed all nine of the American hostages and the three British hostages were still alive. He was flanked by his wife, <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON>, and the head of the committee of journalists who pressured the government for his release. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> writes for the weekly news magazine L'Evenement <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeudi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> refused to discuss the status of the foreign hostages. He said that doing so could put them in danger or cause them to lose the small privileges that make life bearable: the few books and cigarettes they are sometimes allowed. Former American hostage <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> sat in the front row beside <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, fiance of British television journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 31, kidnapped April 17, 1986. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, sister of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held hostage, spoke to <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and the other two French hostages. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> shared a cell with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for several months. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was seized in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985. `` I have never tried to tell my government exactly what to do,'' said Mrs. Say. `` But I think that after more than three years, they could, perhaps, take some pointers from the French and follow the leads and initiatives the French government has provided.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> met earlier in the day with <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>. During the two years that <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> and the government of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> were in office, 10 French hostages were freed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No French hostages are believed to remain in the hands of the kidnappers. Asked what the American government was doing to secure her brother's release, Mrs. Say replied, `` I'm not exactly sure, because they do n't share that with me.'' `` All they tell me is that there continues to be quiet diplomacy, although I'm not sure what that means. After all this time, I have to wonder if quiet diplomay is a code word for no diplomacy.'' She said that after her meetings with the three former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> hostages she was reassured about her brother's physical condition. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> training is standing him in good stead. He is surviving.'' But, she said, it was also clear that he was angry. `` He feels betrayed by his own government and by the people he was in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to serve. I'm sure that when he gets out _ and I believe he will _ it will take a long time from him to recover from this.'' Before the news conference, <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said her husband would be checking back into Val-de-Grace military hospital to recover from exhaustion. The three hostages spent 48 hours in the hospital for physical examinations after they arrived in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last Thursday. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said fellow hostage <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> became ill in September 1985 with what <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> believes was cancer. On Dec. 28, <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> said goodbye to <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and was taken to another, cell where he died.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, longtime <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy and central figure in espionage scandals that rocked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 30 years ago, died in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Wednesday night. The report quoted diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, 76, a member of a prominent British family, was a spy for 30 years while he worked for the British secret service. He was known as the `` Third Man'' who tipped off fellow spies <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> that they were under investigation by British authorities in the late 1950s. Both fled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1951, and <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> followed them to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1963. At one point <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was reported to be an adviser to Soviet intelligence agencies in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The MacLean-Burgess-Philby spy scandals virtually wrecked the exchange of intelligence information between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At one point, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was so highly valued in the British secret service that he was being groomed to be its chief. In April, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> granted his first interview to a Western journalist, telling the Sunday Times that British intelligence let him defect rather than face an embarrassing public trial. He said he found peace and a happy fourth marriage, to a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman, and felt at home in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had been under suspicion for 12 years and his unmasking was a nightmare for British intelligence. It began when <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> defected to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and reverberated into the 1980s with the disclosure that <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, another upper-class Englishman, had been revealed as a traitor and went unpunished. When <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> defected, Blunt was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for information. He later became art adviser to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Blunt died in 1983. <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> espoused Soviet communism as a <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels of British intelligence in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s service. Because of his high contacts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was able to betray the whole Western Alliance. He sent many Western agents to their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat who threatened to xpose him. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was decorated for his services by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> intelligence service and published his memoirs, titled `` My Secret War.'' Asked by his interviewer, `` Would you do it all again?'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> replied: `` Absolutely.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led a march through a crime-ridden area of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Wednesday and urged students to keep away from drugs on the second day of a campaign swing through <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, hoping for a strong showing in the state's May 17 primary to boost his struggling presidential bid, was also campaigning in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, one day after losing two more primaries _ in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He began the day with an anti-drug rally in which he told high school students to turn their lives around. `` You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of your life and you can make a difference,'' he told about 1,300 students at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Dope pushers are killers of the dream,'' he said. `` They're terrorists. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted with thunderous applause on his arrival in the school's gymnasium and received several standing ovations from the students. As he often does in such appearances, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> invited all students who had ever taken illegal drugs to gather next to the stage. At first only a few did, but within minutes about 100 students were standing in front of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` If you must cry, it's all right,'' he told one of the students. `` Just go on and change your ways.'' After the rally, he led a 13-block anti-drug march from the school through one of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s highest crime areas. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and community leaders led a procession of about 2,000 people, and hundreds more lined the streets chanting, `` Win, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, Win,'' and `` Keep Hope Alive.''

 Thousands of people who worked at the fire-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower have moved to temporary quarters in a generally trouble-free transition. Some of the new space even was provided by competing financial institutions. `` Our fiercest competitors have been very nice in this crisis,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a spokesman for First Interstate. The three-hour, 43-minute blaze a week ago gutted 4 -LCB- floors in the 62-story tower, the tallest building in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and caused one death and 40 injuries. An 12th-floor electrical problem was the suspected cause. It will take six to 10 weeks to reopen floors of the vacated 1 million square-foot building that were damaged by smoke and water, officials said. <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumby </PERSON>, a spokesman for First Interstate, said there are no firm estimates yet on how long it will take to repair the burned floors. `` It could be as long as a year. It's all speculation at this point. The analysis of the metal -LRB- structural beams -RRB- has not yet been done,'' <PERSON> Lumby </PERSON> said. Most of First Interstate's 2,000 bank and holding company employees have been working in their new locations since Friday. About 900 report daily to the bank's emergency operations center several blocks from the burned building. The center, described by <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> as `` the operations hub of the bank'' is where employees handle check clearings, statements and securities operations. `` Customer service did n't miss a beat,'' said another bank spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Popovich </PERSON>. Several hundred other people moved to vacant space in nearby buildings; about 800 are on call at home enjoying a paid vacation. `` No one is being laid off,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> hoped to have space next week for all employees. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> helped out the competition in the emergency. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> provided sub-leased office space at downtown for three of the 10 banks operating out of the First Interstate tower. Corporate officers of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> and their clerical staffs moved into a 23,700 square-foot area of the 10th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Hanil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> moved its employes into 4,800 square feet of space, he said, and <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> workers moved into a 3,800-square-foot area on the 47th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Popovich </PERSON> credited the bank's emergency plan and satellite headquarters, a $ 1.5 million contingency facility, for keeping the bank in operation. `` Of course, we expected an earthquake, but it was nice to have it -LRB- the plan -RRB- handy,'' he said. First Interstate owns the bank tower in partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Equitable's real estate subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, manages the building. There also were 30 other tenants, mostly legal firms employing about 1,400 people, with operations in the now-closed tower. Many attorneys have taken refuge in nearby legal offices. `` There has been great community generosity here and reaching out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Wednesday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Suitcase - and box-toting employees, accompanied by security officers, have been making a daily pilgrimage to the fire-scarred tower to pick up crucial files, computer disks and other items such as telephone lists

 Aging American, British and French comrades who harbor the often agonizing memories of one of World War II's most heroic missions gathered Wednesday for probably their last full reunion, 44 years after they were parachuted behind enemy lines `` It took some of them this long to find each other, and they wo n't let go,'' said <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Friele </PERSON>, who was an 18-year-old secretary in the British intelligence office that trained 279 Americans, Britons and Frenchmen for a mission code-named `` Jedburgh.'' Records of the operation remained top secret until 1985, although many of those taking part have told their dramatic stories of sabotaging German forces and supporting the European resistance. The specially trained soldiers were dropped in teams of three with a radio _ scattered across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ in advance of the June 6, 1944 <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> landings. Their code name, Mrs. <PERSON> Friele </PERSON> said, comes from the name of a Scottish town where the term `` Jedburgh justice'' was the rule for dealing with sheep rustlers: `` hang them first and question them afterwards.'' This week, 51 American, 26 French and 18 British survivors of the <LOCATION> Jedburgh </LOCATION> unit will meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, receive honors at the French and British embassies and visit the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters where one of their members, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, was director in the mid-1970s. The final group of French veterans arrived Wednesday to shouts of greetings from their fellow <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. French Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecquenem </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Julien </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Concelles </PERSON> said his memories of the resistance are `` neither sad nor gay. We experienced the happiness of fulfilling a duty.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Friele </PERSON> _ she later married an American `` Jed'' who died in the Korean War and, after the Jeds first reunion in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> four years ago, married another one _ said she has been able to track down all but two of the original <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers in the operation. For them she has only names and scant detail: <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. `` I was 18 and very impressionable, so these people have always been my heroes, and they always will be,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Friele </PERSON>, 62, who has lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the war. Her second husband, <PERSON> Berent </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friele </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, like many of the American Jeds, was also sent into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to aid resistance against the Japanese. Mrs. <PERSON> Friele </PERSON> said life after the war has been difficult for some of the men because of the intensity of their experiences dodging enemy forces. She said the reunion in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and one in 1985 of American Jeds have given the men a chance to share experiences, often unpleasant, that they had rarely talked about. Many had not seen each other since they were trained in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, she said. `` Things that angered them just spilled out,'' she said. `` Some could n't readjust. They became alcoholics and went through terrible experiences,'' she said. But she said many have done very well in the military and elsewhere. In addition to <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, former Jeds include retired Army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, who has organized a controversial worldwide effort to support resistance groups against communism, and internationally known yachtsman <PERSON> Hod </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a retired Marine general. The late columnist <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> was a Jed. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyr </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he only found out after the war that the headquarters of British Special Operations thought some of their messages were coming from the German Gestapo and so did not respond to requests for assistance, including arms drops. <PERSON> Cyr </PERSON>, who was sent behind enemy lines twice in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and later in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said his biggest problem was communications. `` It could take all day to get the radio into the sidepockets of a bike and get out into the countryside to send a simple message,'' he said. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he said, the mostly French-speaking Americans operated in villages and towns with Germans all around them. The Jeds tell the story of one American who did n't speak French and injured his back during the jump. He had to spend time in a German hospital, speaking very little, before a mission was flown in to rescue him. <PERSON> Cyr </PERSON> said he has some horrible memories, including holing up on a farm with 300 resistance fighters and ending up with only 15 survivors after Germans were led to the scene by a Frenchman. Retired Col. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who worked with the Allied forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and with the Americans who went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but was not a <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> himself, is writing a book about the missions. Since the documents were declassified, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> has spent three years going through hundreds of boxes stored in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. He said that despite the obvious danger of the missions, only a handful of the Jeds were killed. `` They were guerrillas. They had to design operations that would keep them alive,'' he said.

 The government of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> canceled a meeting between Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and civilian leaders, including opposition politicians, but a church group pledged Wednesday to try to hold the meeting anyway. The <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it would search for another site if the government prevented use of a sports stadium operated by the Education and Culture Ministry. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive Monday in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on the last stop of his four-nation pilgrimage to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The meeting with about 350 civilian leaders was scheduled Tuesday, May 19. The session in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> had been billed as a `` meeting of the pope with the constructors of society.'' It was intended to bring the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians, including peasants, lawyers, religious leader and members of opposition parties not recognized by the government. The invitation of opposition leaders prompted government criticism. An editorial Sunday in <LOCATION> Patria </LOCATION>, the daily newspaper of President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, described the meeting as a `` corrupt assembly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Patria </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that government officials, citing `` security reasons,'' notified the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s local envoy on Monday that the meeting had been canceled. Tensions between the church and government have escalated in the last year. The church hierarchy has increasingly criticized <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, in absolute power since 1954, and other government leaders. It has accused them of repeated civil rights violations.

 Scientists who experimented with an ancient corpse nicknamed Lady X have developed a new type of museum case to protect from decay such priceless relics as mummies and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The technique involves construction of hermetically sealed display cases filled with inert nitrogen gas. A small-scale prototype of the case, which contains temperature and humidity sensors, a leak detector and almost no oxygen, was unveiled Tuesday during a seminar attended by 100 scientists, museum officials and Egyptian dignitaries. Lady X, a 3,000-year-old mummy, rested nearby in a less sophisticated case. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> used cotton swabs to collect bacteria and fungi from her surface for use in tests that led to development of the new case. `` In the past, very little research has been done on the conservation of organic materials,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON>, director of the institute. Included among organic materials, he said, are mummies, parchment manuscripts, textiles and embroideries, artworks on paper and relics made of leather, bone or wood. The institute, part of the <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, plans to build a full-size display case and test Lady X in it for one to three months, said research director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Preusser </PERSON>. The mummy, a brown-skinned, 4-foot-10 woman believed to have been a commoner, was shipped here from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> last September. Discovered near <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> in the 1960s, she was the first mummy sent out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> since the remains of Pharaoh Ramses II were taken to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1976 for radiation treatment to halt fungal decay. Once research is completed, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will build cases so mummies of 27 pharaohs and queens discovered in 1881 can be placed on display for the first time, perhaps by May 1989, said <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Plans to display 15 of those mummies last October were canceled to await results of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> research, he added. He said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s government has extended its original six-month contract with the institute for another six months to allow completion of research on Lady X, who was nicknamed by an Egyptian official. `` I'm afraid this mummy will stay here and ask for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> green card,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> joked, referring to a temporary work permit. <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said the new case was designed to be built relatively inexpensively so any country can use it to preserve organic materials. He said the institute offered its findings to the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> if the museum wants to build cases to preserve the Dead Sea Scrolls. The leather and papyrus manuscripts were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s and contain all the books of the Old Testament except <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>. Lady X probably was about 40 years old when she did. She lived sometime during <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s New Kingdom period, from 1500 B.C. to 1050 B.C. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has thousands of such mummies. Most were commoners. The mummies were perfectly preserved for millenia in tombs. But after excavation, they became threatened by pollution, bacteria, fungi and changes in temperature, humidity and light. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> scientists did n't take tissue samples from Lady X. Instead, the microbes they collected were grown on strips of parchment placed in glass vials. Growth of the microbes was tested under varying conditions of light, temperature, humidity and oxygen levels, said researcher <PERSON> Nieves </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Juat </PERSON> and Saw Bee Hong were married, but both have been dead for many years. It all began a few weeks ago, when 78-year-old Foo Ah Heoh, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>'s mother, was tormented by a recurring dream of her son, who died 16 years ago at the age of 25. In the dream, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> urged his mother to marry him to a certain Miss Saw. Foo learned that there was a Saw Bee Hong who once lived nearby.

 Eight soldiers who trained Jamaican troops after the 1983 <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion have been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in false travel vouchers to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Special Forces soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, who were temporarily housed in the Americana Hotel in <PERSON> Ochos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts. One showed the amount actually paid for their rooms, $ 27.50; the second showed that the hotel received $ 55. The indictment, handed down Tuesday, said that just before or immediately after returning to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> in May 1984, the eight destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid. They then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid the greater amount and were reimbursed, according to the indictment. Each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with a second count of submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> said the conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $ 250,000, or both. The false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to twice what was taken, or $ 250,000, or both, the spokesman said. The indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in December 1983 to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to provide trained personnel to serve as security forces for the government of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> following the invasion of that country two months before. The eight returned to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> in May 1984.

<TEXT>
 The head of an archives on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination says key material supporting a conspiracy theory appears to be missing from recently opened <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> files. Professor <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON> said Wednesday that discrepancies existed between earlier accounts of how much testimony was taped and the amount of audiotape made available for public perusal last month. `` Our survey of the files has discovered a major gap in the case record,'' <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON> said. `` There is a large shortfall of tape recordings of interviews, -LRB- and -RRB- ... the best circumstantial evidence indicates that more data did exist but disappeared.'' <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON> said the records contain no taped interviews of 51 key witnesses, including 29 whose testimony would have been expected to shed light on whether <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been a victim of a conspiracy. `` The fact that they do have to do with conspiracy is disturbing because it means that the original investigation was either quite incompetent ... or ... if it was n't incompetence and it was some kind of purging of a record, it's the most disturbing of all,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the chief police spokesman, Commander <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, said the department would `` not deal with what somebody else calls a discrepancy.'' `` Everything that we had in file with regards to that case had been turned over to the -LRB- state -RRB- archives,'' he said. `` In terms of individuals coming up with their own theories ... and being critical as to whether they find what they're looking for or not ... the records have to speak for themselves.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON>, who as chief of detectives headed the police investigation into the June 5, 1968, assassination, rejected suggestions of a cover-up and characterized conspiracy theories as `` ridiculous.'' `` I do n't know anything about destroying any tapes at all,'' <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Certain things I understand have been blocked out, but that was to protect a lot of people who were interviewed. I do n't know what was taken out, if anything.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> are part of <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> library's private collection. <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON> started the archives in 1984, when the college in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> accepted material gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group believing more than one person was involved in the shooting. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police concluded in 1969 that <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> alone was responsible for the assassination. Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at Kennedy from behind, while <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> stood in front of him. <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON>, who teaches political science, said that of the 3,470 interviews <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police conducted in investigating the killing, only 301 interviews were available on tape in the recently released record. <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON> said he was told in 1985 by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, co-author with <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> of a 1970 book on the investigation called `` Special Unit Senator,'' that `` every single interview was taped,'' and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> later said he had access to 3,000 hours of audio tape in police department files. After tabulating the approximate length of witness tapes listed in police records `` a generous estimate is that about 400 hours of audio tapes were disclosed,'' by the department, said <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON>. Nobody answered the telephone Wednesday at <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which published `` Special Unit Senator,'' said it had no telephone listing for <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON>, an acknowledged expert on the shooting and its aftermath, said he arrived at his conclusions by cross-checking lists of witnesses with records of taped testimony on file with the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state archives, keeper of the 50,000-page police dossier on the shooting. Several people at or near the Ambassador Hotel at the time <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot claimed to remember a young woman in a polka-dot dress with <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, leading to the `` polka-dot'' conspiracy theory. Those questioned for whom no tape exists include `` 12 persons with information relating directly to whether <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> was accompanied by a female accomplice the night of the shooting, the so-called ` polka-dot dress girl,''' said <PERSON> Melanson </PERSON>. Among those who told police about the polka-dot dress girl was <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON>. She recanted her statement about seeing the girl two weeks after the slaying, but said in April that police badgered her into retracting her statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly been accused of bungling the investigations by conspiracy theorists.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Laotian soldiers digging on their hands and knees scoured a remote hillside Wednesday where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane crashed 22 years ago, but officials said they failed to find the remains of two missing American fliers. The soldiers searched the bamboo - and brush-covered hillside in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province where the OV-1A Mohawk reconnaissance aircraft was shot down on March 15, 1966 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is trying to resolve the fates of 555 Americans listed as missing in action in the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. `` There was an exhaustive search of the crash area from May 2 to 11 ... -LRB- but -RRB- no remains of the two crewmen aboard the aircraft ... were found,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` There was some danger posed by unexploded ordnance left over from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war period,'' <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. `` Three cluster bombs and several live shells were exploded at the excavation site by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> emergency ordnance disposal experts.'' Maj. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the team returned to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> with some pieces of wreckage from the Mohawk and a very small amount of personal effects. He said the soldiers toiled in dusty conditions and temperatures of more than 100 degrees, using simple tools to shovel out clumps of earth and fine metal screens to sift for remains. The 14 Americans stayed in tents at the crash site, about 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> city in southern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said the Mohawk had taken off from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base at <LOCATION> Phu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on a mission involving interdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION>, which communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> used to infiltrate men and supplies into U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He said another aircraft on that mission reported that one crewman parachuted out and landed near the area where the Mohawk crashed. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said that as an expression of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s concern with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' own humanitarian problems, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team donated six months of medicine and equipment worth about $ 13,000 dollars to the <LOCATION> Sepone </LOCATION> district hospital for use by inhabitants of the crash area. It was the third such joint excavation in communist-ruled <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The remains of 11 missing Americans were found in the first joint excavation in 1985, and eight others were found in the second dig in 1986. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> had promised a third dig in 1986, but a long period of inactivity followed until <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed last August to consider <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s calls for humanitarian aid. In February, the Laotians handed over two boxes of remains they said were found in their recent excavations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they received exceptional cooperation from the Laotians. The American team was from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The two Honolulu-based agencies are entrusted with resolving the fates of a total of more than 2,400 MIAs in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The war ended in 1975 with communist victories in all three countries.

 More than 11,000 people cheered first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as she took the stage at the fourth annual national `` Just Say No'' Walk Against Drugs Rally on Wednesday. Initially flanked by two school children, drug-sniffing police dogs, Snoopy, <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the children how proud she was of them. `` Saying no to drugs is the biggest decision your can make in your lives right now,'' she said during the ceremony on the Mall near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. `` You've made a commitment against drugs; that is an adult decision and you deserve the adult respect. `` And I want you to know that you have my fullest respect, not to mention affection,'' she said. As the honorary chairman of the Just Say No Foundation, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the crowd of a campaign to get more young people to pledge to fight drugs when the new school year starts this fall. `` I hope you will join in this drive to renew the pledge against drugs and to get new people to just say no,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks were the highlight of the program hosted by <PERSON> Tempestt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' and <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendrez </PERSON> of The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>'s `` You and Me Kid.''

Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the sister of superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, sang her `` Just Say No'' song while on stage with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Halau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olana </ORGANIZATION>'s champion hula ensemble from <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Most of the children in the program and in the audience were members of the 15,000 Just Say No Clubs active in schools and young people's organizations across the nation. The clubs are an outgrowth of a commitment Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made to a group of school children in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in 1984. Since 1986, the second week of May has been observed as `` Just Say No'' Week, including local and national walks and rallies on the same day.

<HEAD>Cranston Wants Housing Bill To Be Part of Fall Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation calling for a new national housing policy should be ready this summer in time to be a major focus of the presidential and congressional campaigns, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> housing subcommittee, said he wants all of the presidential and congressional candidates to make a commitment to the housing program he has been working on with some of the nation's leading housing experts for the past 10 months. `` We want to have an impact during the campaign so that housing is discussed not just in general terms with all candidates claiming to be ` friends of housing,''' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said in remarks to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. He said commitments are necessary `` so they will be more likely to adopt the policy framework that supporters of housing have developed.'' Meanwhile, representatives of the poor urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> housing subcommittee to approve legislation to provide for the construction of 5 million new public housing units and to modernize 1 million public housing units over a 10-year period. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tingling-Clemmons </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appropriate emergency money `` to begin the immediate restoration, renovation and repair of all existing public housing units.'' He said the tenants' organization also wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass the so-called Jesse Gray Housing Act, named for the 1969 founder of the tenants organization, to provide for additional public housing. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s second-ranking Democrat, said he hopes to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees housing legislation, approve his legislation by Aug. 15 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recesses for the summer. `` We will move it as far as possible through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year,'' he told the realtors, `` but I suspect we will have to wait for a new administration to enact it.'' He said major pieces of the bill should be ready to be announced in June and should be introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in July. `` We should set clear, realistic goals that can be accomplished, say, by the year 2000,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` Even if the initial steps must be smaller than many would like, we can show that they are the right steps and that they are part of a sustainable strategy.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Urges Harsher Economic Pressure Against South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only new and harsher economic pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will prompt the regime to end its policy of official racism, Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday in appealing for new sanctions against his country. In meetings and appearances throughout the day, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> repeated his message that the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of diplomatic pressure has failed. He urged lawmakers to support a new bill that would sever virtually all economic ties between the two countries. `` It is critically urgent that you make a moral decision,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> audience that included about a dozen <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Are you on the side of injustice or justice? The side of oppression or freedom? Of inhumanity or humanity?'' A bill that would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to shed their investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> within a year and ban trade in everything but strategic minerals and agricultural products is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and a similar bill was to be introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and others While supporters are optimistic about <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage, the bill's fate is unclear in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in part because moderate Republicans who were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 are reluctant to go along with harsher measures As <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> sought support for the legislation, a congressional study was issued showing that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s exports to 24 countries which report trading data to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> decreased by 7 percent and imports plummeted by 31 percent from 1982 through the first half of 1987. The declines came while overall trade was rising substantially. The interim report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> did not say how much of the decline was due to the limited sanctions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. Those sanctions banned imports of agricultural products, coal, iron, steel and textiles, and exports of oil, arms, nuclear materials and computers, as well as new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loans. The report also noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> direct investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> declined by about 10 percent since 1982. About 80 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s trade remains with six major industrial nations: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> recently have decreased their share of trade, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has increased its share, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said the South African government remains intransigent, exercising what amounts to terrorism over its black majority despite the earlier sanctions by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And he suggested that world attention to the problem has waned. `` I want to know what the South African government still has to do so the world would be filled with so much revulsion and outrage that it would move heaven and earth to rid the world of the scourge of apartheid,'' the Anglican archbishop said, comparing the government to that of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It sometimes takes our breath away, the things that the South African government has been able to get away with,'' he said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> contended that `` anything that has happened in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has happened because of pressure.'' He specifically cited the continued detention by the government of children as young as 7 and 8 years old, with some held more than a year and kept without contact from the outside. `` What must our people still suffer so that the world, recognizing their anguish, would then say we ca n't allow this to continue?'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> asked. Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, R-Wis., who supported the limited sanctions in 1986, said he was concerned that unilateral action by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might have little impact without parallel moves by other major South African trading partners like <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` It would be far more effective if we had a global approach,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> acknowledged. `` But who is likely to persuade them? No country is in a better position that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... The moral stand you take sends out ripples.'' In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> faulted the current leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for ignoring the problem. `` They have decided that South African blacks are expendable ... profits matter more,'' he charged.

<HEAD>Defense Begins Closing Arguments In Cocaine-Smuggling Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense attorney for <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> charged Wednesday that prosecutors used `` bought witnesses'' who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifying against the reputed Colombian drug lord. In closing arguments at <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s cocaine-smuggling trial, defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said the chief prosecution witness got `` the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. By agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, convicted smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was able to reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $ 5.9 million fine to less than six years in prison, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. `` Boy, did he put it over on the government,'' said the defense attorney. He charged that <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> lied to the grand jury that indicted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1981 and that he again committed perjury in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial. Many other prosecution witnesses also received deals from prosecutors in exchange for testimony, he said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are on trial in federal court on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s private Bahamian island, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, from 1978 to 1980 A separate <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> of being one of the leaders of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, a violent smuggling ring believed to be responsible a large share of the cocaine entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the town of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> after a shootout between Colombian army troops and his bodyguards. He was immediately whisked onto a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which began with jury selection last October. Last week, defense attorneys surprised the courtroom by announcing that they would be calling no witnesses. Closing arguments were expected to continue through Thursday and the jury may get the case Friday. Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> referred to testimony that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> used bribes, charm and threats to run a smuggling empire. For once, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> could n't use such tools. `` He can not buy his way out of a just verdict. He can not charm his way out of a just verdict. And he can not force his way out of a just verdict,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. A day earlier, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was waging a violent war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and viewed cocaine as a weapon. `` He's still at war,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. In his defense arguments, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> told the jury that the judge would instruct them that they should consider the testimony of convicted felons with special care. `` Boy, do we have convicted felons here!'' he said. He argued that many of the government witnesses were given immunity from prosecution, hoping for reduced sentences or some type of deal in return for their testimony. `` The government brought in 29 bought witnesses,'' he said. `` They paid an incredible price to get Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s conviction.'' He also argued that much of the testimony did not concern the charges contained in the indictment. `` The issue is not whether Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was good or bad,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. `` The issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment.'' As an example, <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> cited the days of testimony concerning possible payoffs to officials in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, including allegations that Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> had taken bribes. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> has called the allegations `` a fantasy.'' `` <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> is not on trial here in this case. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is on trial,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. The payment of bribes to <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials, he said, `` is not an issue in this case.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. Co-defendant <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with smuggling conspiracy.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced Wednesday that he would withdraw from the Republican presidential race next week and said in a newspaper interview that he will likely return to his financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said the decision to return to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> is `` not set in stone, but the important thing is whether or not he returns to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, he will continue to be involved in politics.'' She said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would file papers shortly with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a new political action committee _ Americans for the Republic. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> himself, speaking to reporters outside the White House, endorsed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already had the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination well in hand.

 <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s portrait of his innkeeper's teen-age daughter, who wrote a vivid account of the artist's death decades after his suicide, was set to be auctioned Wednesday and was expected to bring more than $ 15 million `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>,'' one of <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s last paintings, is included in a slate of impressionist and modern paintings scheduled for sale at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house. The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> committed suicide in July 1890 in the village of <LOCATION> Auvers </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In an essay written when she in her 70s, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> described the artist's final hours as he lay in his room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound. Interest in the painting is keen, experts say, in part because it serves as a link to the artist's last days. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the auction house where the sale will take place, estimates the work may fetch more than $ 15 million. The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer purchased it at a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction for $ 1.98 million. Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> _ who sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world. In March 1987, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' sold for $ 39.9 million at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a Japanese insurance company. Three months later, `` The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $ 20.2 million, also at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It was bought by an unidentified collector in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Then, in November, history was made when <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises,'' a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a single white iris, sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for $ 53.9 million to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a painting. In the painting auctioned Wednesday, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON>, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in front of her. `` He observed her very deeply, and when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>, senior vice president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s and an expert on impressionist and modern painting. But Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a 1956 essay that she did n't immediately appreciate the painting. `` I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait; it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> wrote. However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying, `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> described <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, who lived at her father's inn during the last 2 -LCB- months of his life, as a disciplined artist and `` a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister. She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother, <PERSON> Theo </PERSON>, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the train station, his face `` distorted by grief.'' Among the other artworks set to be auctioned Wednesday night are works by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassatt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Toulouse-Lautrec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has resumed production of a rocket fuel oxidizer, drawing the ire of jittery officials still recovering from last week's blast at a similar plant two miles away.

With the shutdown of the plant where the explosion occurred, the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> plant is the only one in the nation producing ammonium perchlorate, a component in the solid rocket fuel used in space shuttle and military rockets. `` We feel absolutely satisfied that it's safe,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I think it's ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> City Manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON>. `` I'm totally amazed that they did it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> ceased production of the rocket fuel component last Wednesday following the series of explosions at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant.

He announced it Wednesday from the company's corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON> said plant officials notified Henderson Mayor <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kesterson </PERSON> of the resumption after the night shift had reported for work at the sprawling industrial complex blocks from the downtown. Last week's blast at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Engineering plant, two miles out into the desert, damaged homes and businesses throughout the <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> officials last week promised not to reopen until the cause of the explosions was known. <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON> said he had been instructed by city council members to take legal action to halt the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> operations until the accident's cause is known. The city manager said he thought the city could close the plant, and he wanted to do so. `` I'm very sensitive to the loss of jobs and the loss of industry,'' <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON> said. `` But I'm more sensitive right now to the fact that there's a lot of very nervous people living in this city. `` I do n't think it's unreasonable for <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> to keep the commitment it made to the people,'' <PERSON> Bloomquist </PERSON> said. Military officials have expressed concern about the loss of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> plant and its impact on the national defense. <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Annita </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said the company would be operating three shifts, as it was doing prior to last week's accident `` If there is a need to increase capacity, we will do what we can to meet that need,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said. `` We've looked since the accident as to what kinds of increases we might be able to make.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in nearly seven years reminded authorities that plans to reform the economy and political system are racing against a deadline of mounting public impatience. But the opposition learned that the public is not ready for a repeat of the nationwide strikes of 1980 that led to the birth of Solidarity. The walkouts that began April 25 among bus and tram drivers in the western Polish city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> led to the sit-in strike by hundreds of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard workers that ended Tuesday night in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city. The workers' demands for higher pay and union freedoms echoed August 1980, when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was electrified by a sudden national labor revolt and the Eastern bloc's first independent trade union federation, Solidarity. The organization, formally banned after the imposition of martial law in 1981, claimed 10 million members _ nearly one out of three Poles _ and was far larger than the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party. The younger Poles who are most ready to storm the barricades did not experience the disappointment and trauma of martial law in the same way as their elders. When the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard strike committee _ led behind the scenes by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> _ agreed to discuss a compromise in which the strikers would give up a demand for the immediate recognition of Solidarity, it was the younger generation that balked. `` History does not like to repeat itself. And this was exactly what the aging veterans of Solidarity could not understand,'' said a commentary Wednesday by the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. Although there were frequent expressions of concern and sympathy for the recent protests, the vast majority of society hung back from any overt moves to help the strikers. `` -LRB- The Poles -RRB- saw in 1981 that -LRB- pursuing strikes -RRB- was a cul-de-sac, given the geopolitical situation in this part of the world,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the strikes in 1980-81 led to Soviet-supported repression by the Polish government and further economic hardships for common Poles. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the recent unrest was instructive for the authorities and would cause them to redouble efforts to reform the economic and political systems. Indeed, one day after the last strike, the Polish parliament unanimously passed a program to speed up its plans to make the economy more efficient by giving it special powers to fire managers or take over enterprises that resist economic changes. But the diplomat said the authorities have already lost `` the hearts and minds'' of the new generation. `` Solidarity has not necessarily captured them either,'' he added. He said there was `` impressive but not overwhelming support from the rest of society,'' but that Solidarity calls for sympathy action `` were not taken up with alacrity.'' Official comments were quick to label the strikers' decision to leave the shipyard even without a settlement the end of Solidarity. `` The myth of Solidarity's might has fallen,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> commentary said. It `` turned out to be a small group which could not find support in big enterprises, including those in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, and even in the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard.'' But another Western diplomat said he thought it was too early to write Solidarity's obituary. He said the group will continue to exist `` because it continues to be a necessary focus for a whole band of postulates and opinions that exist among the Polish people.'' For Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, it was more a matter of timing. Despite official propaganda that portrayed him as the manipulator of events, he said repeatedly that the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard this time caught him by surprise and came `` too early'' to attract enough support to be effective. Public dissatisfaction is building, he said, and if authorities do not pursue reform more effectively _ including dialogue with Solidarity and other independent groups _ the final result will be `` bloody revolution.''

Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, the school's top officer, was charged with dereliction of duty, Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said in a statement Tuesday.

Initially, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died of natural causes. But <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s classmates contacted news media and his family to say he was treated unusually harshly the day he died. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, said recruits told her <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was having trouble performing a difficult exercise known as `` sharks and daisies,'' in which instructors jump on top of students in the water to test their rescue abilities. `` The others were told to get out, line up by the pool with their backs to the water, sing the National Anthem and do exercises while they dealt with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> individually,'' she said. The recruits said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> called for help, got out of the pool once, asked instructors to allow him to drop the class but was pulled back into the pool. `` After their exercises, they turned around to see <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s limp, blue body being pulled from the water,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said she was told. Rescue workers began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> will appoint an investigating officer to determine whether the evidence warrants referring the charges to a court-martial or dropping them. If convicted, <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of punitive dismissal from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and three months' confinement; the instructors face a maximum penalty of dismissal and three years' confinement

<HEAD>Study: Poor, Minorities Disenfranchised By Voting Barriers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Discriminatory voter registration procedures are disenfranchising the poor, minority and disabled citizens throughout the country, directors of a private study said Wednesday. Among the practices are arbitrary registration hours, inconvenient registration locations, `` mysterious purging of voters without notice, denial of registration before an election,'' said a statement from Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is the author of legislation to correct such practices The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in hearings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985 `` documented numerous examples of discrimintory practices,'' the group said. The commission also reviewed the registration systems in each state and the historical voting and registration practices. The report said in most states, local officials have `` wide discretion'' in setting times, places and conditions for people to register to vote. `` This discretion is often is exercised in ways which establish barriers to registration and voting,'' said the report. The restrictive practices `` have a disproportionately adverse effect on low-income, minority and disabled citizens,'' the report said. It cited the following examples: _ Limited registration sites affect poor people who do n't own cars. _ Limited hours for registration affect working people who ca n't get away from their jobs _ Many registration sites are inaccessible to the disabled. _ Failure to provide bilingual assistance affects low-income citizens and non-English speaking minorities. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has eliminated the most blatant discrimination practices, but `` remnants of the old systems of disenfranchisement persist,'' the report said. Among the specific problems are refusal by local officials to designate sites in black commuinities for mobile registration units; requirement of excessive identification from black applicants; `` undue scrutiny'' of Hispanics and Asian-Americans to determine their citizenship; sites `` that require extraordinarily long trips'' and dual registration requirements for tribal and state elections for Native Americans. The commission recommended legislation to permit registration by mail, election-day registration, and a congressional investigation into denial of the right to vote for homeless people. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s bill, pending in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, and a companion House bill by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., generally parallels those recommendations The commission is sending a copy of its report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the White House and the presidential candidates, seeking support for its proposals.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Ad Campaign Aimed at Updating Union Image</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said a new $ 13 million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that unions, like their workers, are interested in fairness, justice and life outside the job. The ads, which all end with a chorus singing `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> works best when we say union yes,'' have begun appearing on the television networks and in 13 local markets. The 30-second spots are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all American homes at least four times. Radio spots will be aired as well, including one that urges listeners to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected veto of the trade legislation. Unions have been pushing a provision of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large companies. At a closed-circuit TV news conference to the 13 cities where the TV ads will be shown, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said `` the labor movement has a long, well-documented record of fighting for the rights and the standard of living of working Americans. But in spite of that, there are still many Americans who have serious misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they are necessary in today's work place.'' `` The goal of ` Union Yes,''' he said, `` is to talk directly with American workers about the value of unions in the work place today. One of the best ways to do that now is through television.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the ads `` fill a need to let the population at large know what the trade union movement stands for.'' He said many Americans have `` a stereotype of unions and union members. They see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a $ 500 suit.'' One commercial focuses on women, with a woman saying unions have ensured fairness in promotions. Another, obviously pregnant, woman says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to have her baby and come back to a job. The first phase of the ad campaign runs through mid-June. The second phase picks up on Labor Day in September. The campaign, which is paid for with union dues, is expected to last two years. The ads will star actors <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesseman </PERSON>. Local TV ads will run during May and June in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hungarian Communist Party to Debate New Leadership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist officials under pressure to resolve the country's rising economic and political turmoil said Wednesday that a party conference will grapple next week with changes in national leadership. Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has said the meeting could lead to departure of party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. Critics of the 75-year-old leader, who has headed the party since 1956 when the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> put down an anti-Soviet revolt, blame him for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic problems and for resisting reform. A communique published Wednesday in the state-run media after a one-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it is `` necessary to renew the party's leading bodies.'' It proposed that a conference next week elect a new Committee. Its more than 100 members make key policy decisions for the party. Wednesday's statement said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved a draft policy document for debate at the conference. The original document was written by <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, but the communique did not make clear whether changes had been made to incorporate complaints from critics inside and outside the party that it did not go far enough with reform. In the version published last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accepted blame for the country's economic woes and offered some political reforms, such as multicandidate elections and limited terms in party office. But critics said it stopped far short of allowing genuine political pluralism, an issue hotly debated among the nation's 880,000 Communists and in the state-run media for the past year Austerity measures imposed to curb a gross foreign debt of $ 17 billion have resulted in inflation of more than 15 percent this year and prompted widespread grumbling from citizens and the official trade unions about the government program. The communique on Wednesday said leaders at Tuesday's meeting also debated personnel changes and formed a special committee to deal with such matters at the three-day conference opening May 20. But it did not reveal who made the report on personnel matters or say who will be on the committee. Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they expected some changes in membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at next week's conference. They described Tuesday's decisions as a modest step forward in dealing with the mounting political and economic crisis. Communist party leaders, including <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, have said in recent months they would like the party to retreat from day-to-day adminstrative duties and concentrate on ideological and political leadership of the country. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has also declared readiness for dialogue with any Hungarian who is not opposed to socialism and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s alliance with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a leading contender to succeed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as party chief, has said the political future of the party leader may be up for debate at next week's conference. `` In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if these changes include the person of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, he will accept the decision,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told reporters while in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has said he would step down if asked, but he has shown little sign of wanting to do so. Hungarians will watch closely to see whether outspoken reformers move up or down in party rankings when the conference ends with another <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting May 22.

<HEAD>Labor Department To Monitor Pressures On Pension Fund Managers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launched an effort Wednesday to ensure that pension fund managers who control a growing percentage of the nation's corporate stock are free from improper pressures in takeover battles. Over the next several months, department investigators will be monitoring how selected investment managers vote on takeover defenses and other issues that affect the value of stock, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of labor. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued guidelines in February saying pension fund investment managers should keep the interests of the members of the fund in mind when voting proxies for shares in their care. The enforcement project is intended to see if the guidelines are being followed. `` We're not trying to come out pro-corporate management or pro any other party. The important thing is that pension funds not be viewed as tools or pawns of corporate management or any other party,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. There has been growing concern in recent years that investment managers have been subject to pressure from parties trying to block takeovers, such as corporate managers or union leaders, who have the ability to add to or take away from a fund manager's business. `` We want to make sure there's not undue influence, improper influence, that would adversely affect the economic interests of the plan,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. If the enforcement project turns up violations, investment managers could be subject to civil enforcement proceedings, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, adding, `` If the plan suffers an economic loss ... then there is personal liability.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he did not know how much abuse exists. However, a survey released in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based, non-partisan research organization, showed that 65 percent of pension fund investment managers reported being pressured at least once in voting on corporate takeovers. `` The stakes are high in this area for a lot of parties. There's a great potential for abuse and we hear a lot of assertions ... We're trying to do a little bit of preventive medicine ... before abuse becomes widespread,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. The question of improper influence over fund managers has become more important as more companies call on shareholders to adopt poison pills and other measures designed to thwart corporate raiders. Pension funds controlled 24 percent of the nation's stock last year, up from 19 percent in 1980 and 10 percent in 1970. But, the percentages are significantly higher for stocks traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, and pension funds own 60 percent of some companies, he said. The department estimates by the year 2000, pension funds are likely to control half the stock in all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies.

 The nine astronauts who worked in Skylab, the only manned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space station, gathered Wednesday to celebrate its launch nearly 15 years ago and to urge a greater commitment to space exploration. `` Space is our frontier, and beginning its exploration may be our generation's greatest contribution to human history,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, commander of the second of three Skylab crews. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, who headed the third mission, agreed, saying future space probes `` should avoid the 10 - to 12-day mindset and plan for the long haul. Bean, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and their seven colleagues joined dozens of engineers and other members of the Skylab team in observing the historic events following Skylab's launch aboard a Saturn V rocket on May 14, 1973, from <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The three Skylab missions, from May 1973 to February 1974, resulted in significant information about bio-medicine, solar physics, astrophysics, engineering and technology, materials processing and other topics. But the Skylab team first had to overcome problems that threatened to jeopardize the mission before the astronauts stepped aboard. Ground crews noticed shortly after the launch that a meteorite and heat shield had ripped off and struck solar panels that were left improperly deployed. But ground crews managed to alter the lab's orbit and develop a shield that the first crew members, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON>, carried into space with them 11 days after the initial launch. The crew made a daring space walk to adjust the panels when they arrived and salvaged the mission. Other Skylab crew members were <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garriott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lousma </PERSON>, who flew on the second mission, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON>, on the third. Tuesday's conference, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> as well as local space and aeronautics groups, was held at the <ORGANIZATION> Wernher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> von </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, named in honor of the former German rocket scientist who helped develop the American space program after World War II. The Skylab astronauts showed no reluctance to join a similar mission again. `` Eight of us got together after dinner Tuesday night and someone asked if we would volunteer to go to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON>, scientist pilot on the mission. `` Eight hands shot up as rapidly as possible.'' `` We would do it in a minute,'' said <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, commander of the last mission. <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> said the nation's space program reached its peak in 1967, when it received 7 percent of the federal budget. He said it had been shrinking since then, now getting a fraction of 1 percent of the budget. `` I hope that's not permanent,'' he said. One thing that Skylab showed, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said, is that people can hold up in space longer than was thought. The first crew stayed aboard 28 days, the second 59 days, and the third 84 days. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, now an aerospace consultant in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said today's generation of space scientists should avoid `` reinventing the wheel. They would be remiss if they do n't take the lessons that have already been learned and re-apply them and build on that data.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday the recall of two brands of baby rattles and a puzzle game because they present a choking hazard to infants. The commission said <ORGANIZATION> Li </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peng </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> withdrew its <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> rattle, and Toys-R-Us of <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, withdrew its Crib Pals Shake and Twist Baby Rattle and its Colorforms Story Book Puzzle. The Rainbow rattles, item CT-8013, are plastic with a handle made of what appears to be beads at one end and four bell-shaped noise makers in a circle at the other end. The commission said it did not know of any injuries caused by the rattles, but said they posed a choking hazard because the handle is small enough to enter a child's mouth and can reach the back of the throat. About 86,400 were sold between June 1987 and August 1987 for $ 2.85. The Crib Pals Shake and Twist Baby Rattles, No. 098132, are 5 -LCB- inches by 1 -RCB- inches and have a ball containing liquid and six colored pellets. The commission said the rattle can break during use and the pieces present a potential choking hazard, although no injuries or deaths have been reported. Approximately 24,000 were sold from March 1986 to December 1987 through Toys-R-Us stores for $ 1.48. The Colorforms No. 150 Story Book Puzzles have five wooden pieces and come in two models, the Pinky Brite Bear and the Rosy Brite Bear. Some pieces are small enough to present a choking hazard, the commission said, although no injuries had been reported. About 12,000 puzzles were sold from September 1986 to December 1987 through Toys-R-Us for $ 5.97.

<HEAD>Pentagon Will Increase Payments For Work In Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would increase government payments to defense contractors for work in progress to help ease the burden of lining up financing to perform weapons work. The increase in the so-called progress payment percentage will apply to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contracts awarded on or after Oct. 1, the start of fiscal 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement. The progress payment rate for large contractors will be increased from 75 percent to 80 percent a month, while the rate for small business concerns will be hiked from 80 percent to 85 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> added. The increase is the first since 1981 and follows two reductions in progress payment rates _ in 1985 and again in 1986. The move will cost the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> an estimated $ 500 million in fiscal 1989, but is justified because the current 75 percent rate is imposing `` an excessive financing burden on the defense industry,'' wrote <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, the undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition, who approved the change. Under longstanding practice, defense contractors are allowed to submit monthly bills for contract work in progress instead of waiting until all work is completed. That system of progress payments was developed as weapon systems grew larger and more complex, in many cases requiring years of work and straining the ability even of the biggest company to borrow enough money to keep assembly lines moving. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has never paid progress fees at the full contract rate, however. Currently, for large firms, it pays out a maximum 75 percent of the monthly bill. The remaining 25 percent is withheld pending deliveries, completion of contract work or final audits. The progress payment rate for large contractors has ranged as high as 90 percent in the early 1980's, when inflation was soaring in double digits, but held steady at 80 percent from 1968 to 1981. The last change in the rate _ dropping it from 80 percent to 75 percent _ occurred in 1986 at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' direction in order to trim government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intervenes with new legislation, however, the Pentagon is no longer bound to keep the 75 percent rate. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, `` The 25 percent financing share now required of the defense industry is higher than historical levels and is not compatible with current interest rates and economic conditions.''

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Challenges Delegate Split in Kansas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> say the Democratic presidential candidate was shortchanged in delegates he received at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> district conventions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers filed a formal challenge to the delegate selection process last week, as state party officials prepared for a state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting on Saturday to choose the last of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Supporters say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should have been allocated 12 national delegates instead of the seven he received, based on the results of county caucuses March 19. They also say <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should have 10 delegates instead of 12, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> should have two instead of five. The number of uncommitted delegates would remain at two under the challenge. A total of 26 national delegates was selected April 22 at congressional district conventions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters also complain that the way delegates are chosen in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> is confusing and unduly complicated. `` It's an unfair process,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON>, state coordinator for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. `` When you say ` caucus' to the average person, they say, ` What do you mean?' All we're asking for is what is fair.'' `` We're still formulating an answer to the challenge,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Scranton </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't know what that answer will be yet.'' The state party has until May 24 to rule on the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> challenge. Delegates are selected to the national convention based on a process that started with 117 local caucuses, which chose the people who vote at the district conventions. The district conventions then selected 26 national delegates from the five congressional districts. The third and final step is the selection of 13 delegates at the state committee meeting. Those delegates will be chosen based on the results of the district conventions, with seven going to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and three each to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Beachy </PERSON>, former state party executive director who is acting as a consultant to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign in the challenge, said the 26 national delegates selected at the district conventions should accurately reflect the results of the local caucuses under a party rule. That rule was not followed, he said. Candidates must receive at least 15 percent of the caucus votes before they can receive any delegates, according to the rules. <PERSON> Beachy </PERSON> says people were allowed to re-group at the district conventions and previously uncommitted delegates threw in with either <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did not break the 15 percent threshold in the local caucuses in three congressional districts, he received one delegate from each of those districts after picking up uncommitted delegates at the district conventions. `` They should n't be allowed to re-group after the caucuses,'' <PERSON> Beachy </PERSON> said. `` The caucuses set what the -LRB- delegate -RRB- allocations should be.'' <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> acknowledged there is a difference of opinion in interpretation of party rules. He also joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters in their complaints about the complicated process. `` Anyone who has tried to administer this, from the county selection on up to the national selection, is painfully aware of how complicated it is,'' <PERSON> Scranton </PERSON> said.

 Eight soldiers who trained Jamaican troops after the 1983 <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion have been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in false travel vouchers to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Special Forces soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, who were temporarily housed in the Americana Hotel in <PERSON> Ochos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts. One showed the amount actually paid for their rooms, $ 27.50; the second showed that the hotel received $ 55. The indictment, handed down Tuesday, said that just before or immediately after returning to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> in May 1984, the eight destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid. They then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid the greater amount and were reimbursed, according to the indictment. Each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with a second count of submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> said the conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $ 250,000, or both. The false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to twice what was taken, or $ 250,000, or both, the spokesman said. The indictment did not indicate the total amount of the false vouchers, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would not comment Wednesday. The indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in December 1983 to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to provide trained personnel to serve as security forces for the government of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> following the invasion of that country two months before. The eight returned to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> in May 1984.

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> on Wednesday attacked a bill to amend Indian adoption and child custody laws, saying it contains provisions that smack of `` pure racism.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> wrote Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, that he was `` extremely alarmed'' about some portions of the bill. Assistant Interior Secretary <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Swimmer </PERSON>, a former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation who is in charge of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> affairs, asked the committee to hold up action on the bill until the department could propose a substitute. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said one provision of the bill gives parents no right to object to a tribe's attempt to transfer custody or adoption cases from state to tribal court unless the objection is `` consistent with the best interests of the child as an Indian.'' `` The provision ignores all other aspects of the child's status as a human being. That, in my view, is pure racism,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. Current law permits tribes to claim jurisdiction in adoption and custody cases only for children of enrolled members, but the bill would extend that jurisdiction to children whose `` parents and other ancestors of the child may have had no connection with the tribe, perhaps for years or even generations,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. In his testimony at a hearing of the committee, <PERSON> Swimmer </PERSON> said, `` We do not believe that Indian parents and their children should have to return to the reservation of their tribe, which is often in another state, for a court proceeding concerning the child.'' `` We strongly oppose the expansion of the definition of Indian child and recommend that the definition should not only contain a membership requirement but also that the domicile of the birthparent or parents is in Indian country,'' Swimmer said. If the family does not live in Indian country _ on a reservation _ then state courts should have jurisdiction, following certain guidelines of federal law for placement of children in foster homes and adoptions `` unless the best interest of the child requires a different placement,'' Swimmer said.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to predict <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of the nuclear missile treaty as a result of the progress in talks supervised by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. But, he said, `` it is still our expectation we're going to get this resolved'' before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29 for a fourth summit meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The issues, involving verification of the agreement to scrap all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range missiles, were taken up by two teams of negotiators headed by American <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> and Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, the senior arms control specialist on the Soviet general staff. Four or five issues were tentatively resolved, including two big hurdles, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. One deals with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to inspect Soviet missile containers big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket. The other involves how much access <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will have to Soviet missile plants and bases. Nine verification problems surfaced in recent weeks. In addition, the Soviets demanded the right to inspect West German Pershing 1-A missiles stored in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In another sign of progress, the two sides agreed to exchange notes on futuristic weapons. The aim is to persuade Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and other critics that the ban would apply to intermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday he could not guarantee <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the treaty before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` I ca n't tell you what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is going to do,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters before his first meeting at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` That's for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to decide. But I think it would be a good thing to have ratification before the summit meeting.'' On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> indefinitely postponed debate on the treaty. Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders said the Soviet response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints about restrictions on monitoring were inadequate. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the Democratic leader, said: `` We do n't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were less critical but also urged the Soviets to modify restraints they intended to impose on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> monitors at missile plants. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was as interested as he was in seeing the treaty ratified. `` I am not going to try to characterize the disagreements,'' the secretary said. `` Since nobody has ever done anything like this before, it's not surprising there are problems. Obviously we think we're on the right track. However, we approach this in a problem-solving spirit.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>: `` We think that we can iron out our differences. They are not very big ... so we still hope and we think that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is going to ratify the treaty before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.'' The pact on intermediate-range missiles, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed last December, is unprecedented in its provisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. It also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons. Under its provisions, the Soviets would destroy 683 missiles and the Americans 364 _ all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3,125 miles. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had two sessions with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Wednesday and two more scheduled for Thursday. The secretary of state will go to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> Friday to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and then fly home to report to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were also dealing with summit preparations and other issues such as human rights and the presence of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops in Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 A second luxury yacht seized for carrying tiny amounts of drugs remained in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs custody Wednesday, as the crackdown under the new `` zero tolerance'' policy continued. And a jetliner owned by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was seized Wednesday following the investigation that began when cocaine was found aboard it. The seizures come a day after the $ 2.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to sail away following payment of a fine. The $ 600,000 Ms. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>, a boat used to entertain customers of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Cigarette Racing Team, was boarded Monday as it returned from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and docked in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salerno </LOCATION>. A search by Customs agents turned up cocaine residue on a dollar bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag. `` It's simply being detained and checked right now for narcotics, and a determination will be made later'' whether to confiscate the ship, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said Wednesday. Neither the ship's captain, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON>, nor his unidentified first mate, who were the only people aboard the boat registered out of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, were charged with drug possession. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said the plane's seizure also was `` consistent with zero tolerance.'' The new, tough policy allows the confiscation of a boat, plane or other conveyance if it carries any amount of drugs, no matter how small. The plane's seizure was based on a 35.8-pound cocaine shipment found March 27, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said, adding that the delay was to allow for a full investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> has a right to appeal the process by petitioning the government for release of the plane, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Since October 1986 Customs has made 10 seizures aboard <LOCATION> Avianca </LOCATION> planes, many of them in flower shipments, for a total of 1,000 pounds of cocaine. The Ark Royal, seized under the get-tough rule, was held for three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> found some marijuana seeds and stems in a trash can and a drawer Saturday. But the 133-foot vessel, complete with hot tubs and a grand piano, was released Tuesday afternoon when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, president of the California-based company that owns the boat, paid a $ 1,600 fine. Fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are ever returned to owners. The Ark Royal was in that minority because its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition, Customs officials said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday required banks, savings institutions and credit unions to meet strict deadlines for making available funds deposited by check. The new rules, effective Sept. 1, require financial institutions to give customers access to deposited funds within one, three or seven days, depending on the type of check deposited. Banks have opposed the rules fearing they wo n't have enough time to make sure deposited checks will not bounce and are not forged. Consumer advocates, however, say some banks make customers wait longer than necessary before they get access to their money. According to staff members, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was flooded by more than 1,000 formally submitted comments after it proposed the rules in December. The board voted 4-2 to approve the new regulation. One dissenter, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, argued that it burdens small institutions with paperwork and leaves banks vulnerable to fraud. Board member <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> also voted against the rules. Board member <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, who voted to approve the regulation, said legislation enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August left the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> with little choice but to adopt it. <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> was joined by Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Funds from cashier's checks, certified checks and government checks must be made available for withdrawal by 9 a.m. on the next business day. Financial institutions will have three days to make funds available from local checks written on an institution in the same metropolitan area. Funds from checks written on out-of-town banks can be held up for as long as seven days. By 1990, the hold periods will shrink to two days for local checks and five days for out-of-town checks. Checks deposited through automatic teller machines after 2 p.m. will not be considered received until the next day. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is also requiring banks to disclose their availability policies at teller windows and to provide a reminder on preprinted deposit slips to custmers using automatic tellers.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stargazer hopes to keep her White House consulting link until the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but says she's troubled by being in the spotlight and by the `` kooks'' in her business. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, so discreet about her work that one of her high-society acquaintances said she `` did n't know anything about this astrology bit,'' contends her role has been greatly exaggerated. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a very able woman and is very nice to deal with,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` She uses astrology constructively.'' But after the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> leave the White House next January, `` there's no way'' she'd sign up a subsequent president as a client, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said in an interview. `` After the end of this year, I will never do anything connected with any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president or his wife or anybody again,'' she said Tuesday. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> has been besieged by reporters and photographers since Sunday's disclosure of her high-level consultations. The socialite and heiress, author of three books on astrology, was a regular guest on <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s television talk show from 1973 to 1985, making astrological predictions. She met Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> through <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a longtime friend of the Reagans who shares a July 6 birthday with the first lady. But despite her television appearances, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> has largely evaded public scrutiny. `` She is one of the few I've met astrologically who does n't seek or want publicity,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, Ariz.-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrologers </ORGANIZATION>. He calls her `` well-versed in classical astrology.'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said she developed her interest in astrology from her mother and her disdain for sensationalism from her father, the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Republican and hotelier. His view of it as a bizarre profession caused her to keep her work secret early in her career. The publicity of the past few days, she said, `` is very embarrassing to me.'' `` I've been put in a terrible situation because I'm an ethical person and I do n't talk about my clients. But I had to come forward to show that I am a serious person with a scientific approach to astrology.'' She declines to discuss her handful of clients but is quick to criticize pop astrologers and syndicated horoscope writers she regards as the `` kooks'' and charlatans of her profession. `` How can it be possible that the same thing is happening to one-twelfth of the world's population on a given day? They give astrology a superstitious name,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said she offered her services to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in the 1980 campaign, then signed on as a consultant for an undisclosed fee in 1981, after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was shot and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s concerns about his scheduling were heightened. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said she has spoken with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this week but would not reveal her reaction to the flap. A spokeswoman for the first lady has said she will continue to use astrological portents in shaping the president's schedule. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, according to the astrologer, has a `` fabulous'' chart. `` He's an Aquarian, and all our greatest presidents except for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been Aquarians: <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' she said.

<HEAD>China Has Ended Pork Rationing, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has ended pork rationing, according to Chinese officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork rationing in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had stopped being enforced,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a report `` Other officials said that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though no official announcement has confirmed this.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet. `` The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however, affect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets -LRB- primarily <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the report said. `` In fact, the country has had a surplus of hogs for export to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but increases in hog trade between the two countries have been limited by a Chinese export quota.'' The report said an end to rationing `` shows that Chinese agricultural officials believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved'' as producers respond to lower feed prices, higher pork prices and government incentives to promote larger production. `` It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower prices in state markets,'' the report said.

 Underground leaders in the occupied lands urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on Wednesday to `` burn the earth with fire and anger'' in continued rebellion. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the uprising has the same goals as Palestinian `` terror organizations,'' and declared that `` terror must be met by force.'' Doctors at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said a 19-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died of gunshot wounds suffered in a clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers last month in a village near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. An army spokesman said reports of the death were being investigated. It would bring to at least 186 the number of Palestinians killed in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since Palestinian riots began Dec. 8. Instructions for more Arab strikes, boycotts and other resistance appeared in a new underground leaflet. It was distributed as soldiers rounded up at least 11 journalists and other community leaders in overnight raids. `` Let's burn the earth with fire and anger under the feet of the occupation,'' the leaflet said. `` Painful blows should be inflicted against the occupation soldiers and policemen and the collaborators.'' The bulletin was the 16th from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising in five months of rebellion among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. It said the leadership `` calls for a complete boycott of the Zionists and asks the people to ready themselves for civil disobedience by storing food in houses, enough for at least a month.'' Police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidoth </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said more than 2,000 extra officers were ordered deployed in the <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from Thursday through early next week. He said they were needed to handle anticipated Arab protests this weekend at the end of the Moslem feast of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> and on Sunday, Jerusalem Day, when Israelis celebrate the 21st anniversary of city's reunification. The leaflet ordered demonstrations on Friday the Moslem sabbath, a `` day of anger'' and general strike Sunday and a march by teachers to protest the closing of Palestinian schools. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a meeting of B'nai B'rith leaders from around the world the uprising has `` the same political goals ... that the Palestinian terror organizations try to achieve by terror and atrocities.'' `` Terror must be met by force,'' he said. `` Any giving in to violence will invite more violence, terror and the increasing danger of war.'' He defended the use of force to put down the revolt, saying soldiers and police acted within the limits of Israeli law. `` I know that you have seen television day and night, all the stories of confrontation between civilians and the military,'' he said. `` I will not deny it. This is what we have to do.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION>, 47 Palestinians were charged with manslaughter in the lynching death of an Arab man accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Id </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakanda </PERSON> was dragged from his home and hanged from an electricity pole in February. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers closed the main vegetable market in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and used loudspeakers to order merchants there and in other towns to keep their shops closed in the morning, when leaders of the uprising have told them to open. A struggle between the army and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership over when stores will close and open has continued for months.

 A former Libertarian congressional candidate was accused of trying to hire a `` patriotic'' assassin to kill Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> `` to make a statement,'' authorities said Wednesday. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, 74, a tax protester who claims to be head of a political extremist group called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION>, was held without bail in the <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on charges of solicitation of capital murder. <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, who was under surveillance for about a month, was arrested Tuesday after agreeing to pay an undercover officer $ 5,000 to kill <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, District Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` He was doing it to make a statement. He wanted to get publicity,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` It was n't a spur-of-the-moment thing. It was thought out. He is firm in his convictions and somehow or another he wanted a hitman with the same resolve, the same philsophy. `` He just did n't want anybody. He wanted a patriot to carry out the execution,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who met with the mayor Wednesday to discuss the threat. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, 40, a four-term mayor and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not getting additional protection and joked that he was insulted he was worth only $ 5,000. `` I'm going about the business of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and this is not going to dissuade me,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, a resident of <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>, 18 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, mentioned other possible targets, including State Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, before deciding on <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, the prosecutor said. `` <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s name was mentioned ... but for whatever reason, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> being out of town, not enough name ID, he settled on <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Officers arrested <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> at a supermarket pay phone. In his car were a .22 - caliber rifle and `` execution warrants'' issued by the `` Sovereign Court of the People,'' police The warrants contained blanks for names of public officials to be assassinated. `` The above-named traitor or traitors are to be executed on sight,'' read the warrants. `` Each accused has given public proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is a traitor to the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the investigation began about a month ago after <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted his office, saying an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent had talked to <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, who wanted to assassinate a public official. An undercover officer later talked to <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> on the telephone several times and in person for the first time Tuesday, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abell </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the 23rd Congressional District seat in 1982. More recently, he and several members of his group picketed the courthouse to protest the grand jury system, officials said. `` He said his group was small to avoid dissension among the troops,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, head of the special crimes unit. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>'s affiliation with the party ended in 1985. `` Our philosophy is to live and let live and, politically, we would like to see as little government as possible,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, `` but we do n't want to do this through violent means.''

 Sportscaster <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> drank `` before, during and after telecasts'' and once threw up on <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s cowboy boots during `` Monday Night Football,'' a former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> executive says in a forthcoming book In `` Up Close & amp; Personal: The <ORGANIZATION> Inside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Story </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> also calls <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> `` one of the unhappiest human beings on this planet.'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for 26 years, was senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 until he left the network in 1986. He is now president of a sports production and marketing company. His book, co-written with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>, will be in bookstores next month. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> as an insecure, overbearing man who became impossible to work with late in his career. `` He had made millions of dollars, traveled the world, been applauded and honored time and time again. Yet, today, I think he is one of the unhappiest human beings on this planet,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON>, 70, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A woman answering the phone at his home said he was visiting his wife at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospital, where she is recovering from surgery. According to <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON>'s drinking sometimes became a `` major problem.'' During a `` Monday Night Football'' telecast from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1970, he said, <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> `` got so drunk he could n't pronounce the name of the city he was in without slurring.'' <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> left the booth after throwing up on <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, one of his broadcasting partners. At the request of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told reporters that <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> became ill after one drink because of a reaction to flu medication he was taking. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> `` again got out of control'' during <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s telecast of the 1984 American League playoffs when he kept kept interrupting colleague <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said he got a call the next day from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s agent, who said `` Al had told him that <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> was drinking heavily and was impossibly argumentative, and that <PERSON> Al </PERSON> could no longer tolerate it.'' <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sportscasters reached a low point after he criticized them in his 1985 book, `` I Never Played the Game.'' `` We were all sick and tired of his bad-mouthing of everybody and everything,'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Cosell </PERSON> left the network in 1985. In January, he started a nationally-syndicated TV show that recently went off the air.

<HEAD>OSHA Imposes $3.1 Million Fine Against IBP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> imposed a $ 3.1 million fine Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for requiring employees at its <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, meatpacking plant to do such repetitive work that their health was endangered. The fine is the second largest <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has ever imposed against an individual company. The only bigger fine _ $ 4.2 million _ was levied against <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> in Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, in November 1987, said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said inspectors and a specially hired expert in ergonomics found a `` significant occurrence'' of repetitive motion injuries among workers at the plant. The agency maintains that <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> could have taken numerous steps to reduce the risk of such injuries, but did not. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the injuries are `` a major health hazard in one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking industry, in general, and <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>, in particular, to eliminate the problem.'' `` IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders have had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has 15 working days to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $ 2.6 million fine levied by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> last July for safety and record violations at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant. In a statement issued late Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> officials said the citation `` represents a misguided attempt by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to force the meatpacking industry to blindly accept untested theories about the prevention of repetitive motion disorders.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to intimidate companies by threatening enormous penalties unless they accept <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland theories,'' the statement said. The company said that it has urged <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a special program for the meatpacking industry, but <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has not done that. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he was pleased with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s action and its recommendations for changes in working conditions at the plant. `` There are very simple ways of preventing injuries,'' <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> said, `` and it's better to prevent the injuries than fining the employer afterward. It would be far preferable if <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> would stop denying there is a problem and start working on solutions.'' <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said the history of the latest fine dates back to November 1987, when safety inspectors from the agency `` noticed a pattern of repetitive motion injuries,'' a sometimes crippling injury caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion. As a result of that finding, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> expanded its inspection to health-related issues and hired an expert in ergonomics, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, to do more extensive studies. What the studies found, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said, was that 620 workers at 45 work stations at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant were `` at grave risk'' of developing repetitive motion illnesses. Of those, 377 workers actually had developed the illness, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. Some of those required surgery to correct, some are on restricted work schedules and some are on permanent disability leaves, he said. The affected employees work on the production lines, doing such work as cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat with hooks, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> maintains that <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> should have done such things as changing the design of knives, educating workers about the need to change positions periodically and slowing its production line. `` Much of this particular situation is connected with a speedup of the production line,'' <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. The $ 3.1 million fine represents a $ 5,000 penalty for each of the 620 workers. <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> estimated that a total of 3,000 people work at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant, one of 15 IBP plants. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> began investigating <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> in the winter of 1986 after receiving a worker complaint about conditions at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plant. A preliminary investigation showed that <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION>'s records showed an unusually low occurrence of worker injuries and illnesses, <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> then launched a more extensive investigation, which resulted in the $ 2.6 million fine for under-reporting injuries and illnesses at the plant. At the time when <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> was beginning its first investigation, <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> and workers at the plant were engaged in a bitter lockout that turned into a strike. The seven-month strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ended last July.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced Wednesday that he would halt his Republican presidential race next week, and said in a newspaper inerview that he will likely return to his financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said the decision to return to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> is `` not set in stone, but the important thing is whether or not he returns to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, he will continue to be involved in politics.'' She said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would file papers shortly with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a new political action committee _ Americans for the Republic. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> himself, speaking to reporters outside the White House, endorsed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already had the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination well in hand. The former television evangelist said he would formally withdraw from the race Monday. `` I will be making that official on Monday, as a candidate, because the race now is over and the people that I wanted to bring through the process are pretty much home now in relation to their races,'' he responded when asked if he were withdrawing. But an aide, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, later described <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s planned move as a suspension, rather than a withdrawal. Asked whether he would be releasing his delegates, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> responded: `` Well, of course, I will be releasing them.'' `` Many of them were not really bound to me because in the caucuses, it has to do with their own preferences. However, the procedures go on the first ballot, we want to make sure that there's a unanimous vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would release the delegates, but not immediately. Meanwhile, in an interview published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginian-Pilot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Ledger-Star of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he likely would return to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded nearly 30 years ago, as chief executive officer, a job his son now holds. `` I do n't have a comment to make,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` None of the staff or I ... have been provided any information by him at this point concerning what his future plans are.'' Since 1967 <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had co-anchored the `` 700 Club'' program that is the heart of the network in terms of viewership and fund raising. He left the program in 1986 to organize his presidential campaign, and in September 1987 resigned both as the network's chief executive officer and as a pastor in the Southern Baptist church to run for office The network quickly reported a big drop in revenue and began laying off personnel. At the time, spokesmen refused to blame <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s political ambitions for the shortfall. In March, <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> announced it faced a deficit of $ 500,000 for the month, and sent out pleas for more donations. `` I did not realize that my personal presence on the ` 700 Club' was as important as it is to the audience,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the newspaper His return was seen as both a political and economic necessity by several experts. `` He needs to shore up his base,'' said one, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> political scientist and longtime <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> watcher. `` This campaign in the later stages has been injurious to that base. Such severe setbacks as he has suffered have shaken even his staunchest supporters.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has spent over $ 22 million on his campaign, has but 46 delegates to the national convention, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more than 1,300. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished third to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in most of the early primaries. Ms. <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON> said the new political action committee will raise money and train conservative Christians who want to become involved in the political process. The staff of Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would switch to the new PAC, keeping the same offices in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, she said. The new PAC has a purpose similar in some ways to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which had tax-exempt status before it folded in 1986 after Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was incorporated Critics challenged the council as being merely a front for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s then-undeclared campaign, and it is being investigated along with <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> and Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike the council, Americans for the Republic will actively support candidates, Ms. <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON> said.

 The pilots of Aloha Flight 243 knew they had problems as they tried to land their plane with a large section of its cabin wall and ceiling torn away, but for a time they thought their predicament was even worse, it was revealed Wednesday. According to a tape of radio communications from the crippled <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, the pilots were certain as they approached the airport on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> that the nose landing gear had failed to deploy. This would have made landing the severely damaged aircraft especially dangerous, according to aviation experts. `` Be advised we have no nose gear. We are landing without a nose gear,'' co-pilot <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> `` Mimi'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport tower in a strained but controlled voice as Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> struggled to keep the aircraft aloft. `` We'll need all the -LRB- emergency -RRB- equipment you got,'' she continued, although giving little hint as to how serious Flight 243's predicament really was last April 28 in the skies above <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Only seconds before the plane landed on the runway did the controller tell the pilots the landing gear actually was deployed. They possibly had been misled by a false instrument reading. The tape was played Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the same day that Schornstheimer and <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> were honored by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for their heroics. They met with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> told the pilots group that training and teamwork allowed him and Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> `` to stay calm and fly the airplane'' as they rapidly descended from 24,000 feet to a safe landing with a 20-foot section of the cabin exposed to the sky, one engine out and another engine damaged by flying debris. A flight attendant was swept to her death during the flight. The two pilots were presented the Superior Airmanship Award from the 40,000-member pilots union for landing the plane safely without any additional casualties. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tape provided little hint of the drama that was unfolding aboard the aircraft. The plane was just approaching the south coast of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> when the first word of trouble aboard the plane reached the control tower. `` <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> tower, Aloah 243. We're inbound for a landing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> advised matter of factly. After providing the plane's position, she added, `` We are unpressurized, declaring an emergency.'' The tower directed another plane away from the runway and advised that Flight 243 had a clear, straight approach and emergency vehicles would be waiting. While Schornstheimer flew the plane, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> handled the radio. While they must have been aware of the huge missing section of the cabin wall and ceiling, they never suggested the extent of the plane's damage to the control tower during the 10 minute and 18 second descent and landing. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> suggested that the controller had no need to know the information and the crew probably was busy otherwise. Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> at one point advised there were injuries on board. How many? `` We have no idea. We can not communicate with our flight attendants,'' she replied, the strain in her voice now showing. Muffled noise could be heard in the background as the wind whipped through the cockpit _ its door torn off by the rapid depressurization. The pilots later explained they had to resort to hand signals to communicate. As Schornstheimer struggled to keep the plane flying on a direct path to the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport, Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> advised that the cockpit instruments indicated the nose landing gear had not deployed. Two minutes later there came good news. `` Just for your information, the gear appears down. The gear appears down,'' the tower informed Flight 243 seconds before it landed. `` Aloha 243, just shut it down where you are. Everything's fine. ... The fire trucks are on the way,'' the controller then said. During the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> ceremony, <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said, `` What seemed like a short time to <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> and I because of our busy cockpit duties must have seemed like an eternity to our passengers and flight attendants.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> praised the captain, an 11-year veteran of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> analyzed the situation confronting us and he reacted,'' she said. `` All of his decisions were the right ones.'' Despite the experience, she said she was eager to return to the cockpit: `` I ` m looking forward to going back to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and flying again.''

 The House cast aside President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s objections Wednesday and passed a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget bill that restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars programs The 252-172 decision in the Democratic-controlled chamber went largely along party lines. The bill will eventually be sent to a conference committee to be reconciled with the different <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget measure now on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, voted Wednesday for a $ 4.55 billion Star Wars budget, narrowly rejecting a move to cut deeply into <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s cherished anti-missile research program The House bill authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 299.5 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the same total as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan and the amount <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved last December in an agreement with congressional leaders aimed at reducing federal budget deficits. The current budget is about $ 299 billion. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> added a ban on any Star Wars tests that violate the so-called `` narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and also voted against buying any nuclear weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear arms treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by a 51-45 margin, voted Wednesday afternoon to kill a provision in that chamber's bill that would also ban weapons beyond the SALT II limits. The House also added a directive telling <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to order the military into the fight against illegal drug smuggling. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is likely to consider a similar proposal. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposes both arms restrictions and is also unhappy with the $ 3.5 billion approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had wanted $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> next year, compared with the current SDI budget of $ 3.9 billion. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was `` deeply disappointed'' by the chamber's actions and said the restrictions `` would seriously undermine our position in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and -LRB- would -RRB- hold back the progress of the Strategic Defense Initiative.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he wants progress in nuclear arms control, but added, `` We can not do it alone. It is time for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to step up to these responsibilities and pass a defense authorization bill that will strengthen our security.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't believe the president has any reason to be upset I think it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of what he wanted.'' Hours before the final <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 50-48 against a deep reduction in Star Wars. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., to reduce the SDI budget to about $ 3.8 billion and devote the extra $ 750 million to the space shuttle and a space station <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s loss was similar to his defeats in each of the past two years, when he failed by a single vote to slash the SDI budget. Last year, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast the tie-breaking vote in his role as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s presiding officer. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has consistently scaled back <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s annual requests for sharp increases in spending for the 5-year-old program SDI program. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has said he would recommend a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto of the entire <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes enough money for Star Wars. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> argued that `` it's going to be very, very difficult to get that space station going unless we give it some more money. ... What's the higher priority here, the space station and the shuttle or SDI? The space station has a lot of defense implications. ... Dollars are scarce.'' But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s proposal `` would be very detrimental to the defense budget. Originally, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., simply proposed reducing the proposed SDI budget from $ 4.6 billion to $ 3.9 billion, but that lost on a 66-29 vote While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure restricts <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arms control policies and Star Wars, it granted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for spending for a vast variety of weapons. That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets, 42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers, two more attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the first of the new `` Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks.

 A Taiwanese gangster was sentenced Wednesday to 27 years to life in prison for the 1984 murder of a Chinese-American journalist, a slaying he said the Taiwanese government had ordered. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-sen </PERSON>, 36, a member of the Taiwan-based international gang <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted in March of gunning down <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> in the garage of the writer's home in <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. With an ear cocked toward an interpreter, <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>, heard <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> call him guilty of `` political terrorism.'' <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> drew 25 years to life for murder plus two years for use of a firearm. Prosecutor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 17 years, eight months. The defendant was ordered to serve the sentence following completion of a 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling. He is serving that sentence at a federal prison in <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> was a columnist for Chinese-language newspapers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and had just published an unflattering biography of Taiwanese President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, who died four months ago. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>'s trial that before her husband's slaying, the Taiwanese government had sent former friends of <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s to try to persuade him to quit criticizing the <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s killing was ordered by <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiao-wu </PERSON>, grandson of former Chinese nationalist leader <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and the son of former <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> said he thought he was being a patriot in carrying out the slaying, and said at the close of the trial: `` This was an act of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> -RRB- government. ... -LRB- I was -RRB- a scapegoat for the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government.'' He said he went to trial so that he could apologize and reveal the identities of those people behind the crime. In a letter to the court, Mrs. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> had asked that <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> be shown mercy, saying he `` entertained a very naive patriotism which was shrewdly manipulated by the plotters who are still at large.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said she had been `` touched by the repentance publicly expressed by Mr. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Mingo County Voters, Tired of Corruption, Nominated Political
Novices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters rejected three of five candidates under criminal indictment and nominated a host of unknowns to key offices in what the secretary of state called `` the cleanest election in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> history.'' The poverty-stricken mountain coal mining county has been saddled with a corrupt reputation for years. In 1986, the fire chief was convicted of running a drug ring and the sheriff pleaded guilty to buying his job for $ 100,000. Tuesday's primary election for <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, county commission, sheriff and other posts marked the decline of `` slatemakers,'' powerbrokers who in the past have bought a person's vote for $ 2 or a half-pint of bourbon, officials said. The three indicted officials who lost Tuesday were state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> and Chief Magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, both seeking re-election, and former state Rep. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who ran for county assessor. Two indicted officials will be on the November ballot _ former Magistrate <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON>, who captured the Democratic nomination for assessor, and surveyor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. `` The results signal that an overwhelming majority of <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Countians </PERSON> are determined to put an end to the kind of political corruption which had drawn unfavorable attention from outsiders,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON>, the state's chief election officer, said Wednesday. `` Now I trust this determination will stick and that the clock wo n't be turned back in the future.'' Fanning, <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> were among 15 political figures indicted April 7 on charges of conspiring to control elections through excessive political contributions to a <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> political slate. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was indicted last fall on bribery and conspiracy charges for his role in a deed transaction. All have pleaded innocent. Of the 69 people running for 12 county-wide offices, 57 were political novices and 43 had never run for office before. Five novices were nominated, including four who never before had ran a race. Former Sheriff <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> won the Democratic nomination for sheriff and will run in November for the post he held until 1980, when political boss and subsequent Sheriff <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> led a successful ouster suit against him. <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON> said his indictment made him `` the underdog.'' He said his strategy was to explain the charges to voters. `` Apparently, it's paid off,'' he said Wednesday. `` They believe me.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Chattaroy </LOCATION>, won re-election to the surveyor's office, a position with no salary and no official duties, by a wide margin Fanning, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> whose district also covers <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON>, lost his state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat to political newcomer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>. No Republican is scheduled to run against <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> in the November general election. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> ran fourth in a field of 11 in a race for three magistrate positions. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidebottom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s magistrate's assistant, led the ticket

<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with neutral

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Queen <PERSON> Margrethe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> turned the struggle to form a new Danish government into a battle royal on Wednesday when she named a neutral politician to lead coalition negotiations. Her unexpected choice of <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman since 1981, upset Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s hopes to quickly reassemble his coalition of four center-right parties following parliamentary elections on Tuesday. Normally the chief negotiator, called `` the royal investigator,'' is the person most likely to become prime minister. But <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON>, 53, has said he does not want the job of prime minister. The pro-NATO <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> gambled on an early election after failing to stop a resolution in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month which tightened enforcement of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s peacetime ban on nuclear weapons, a measure seen as a threat to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy. Election analysts said elections Tuesday for the 179-member Folketing, or parliament, showed a modest shift to the right and strengthened the parties giving the Western alliance unqualified support. But the inconclusive results left the political field open to both the government and the socialist opposition bloc to woo the <ORGANIZATION> Social-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> party, which holds the balance of power. The issue of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s relations with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> faded in the political confusion and uncertainty. <PERSON> Margrethe </PERSON> assigned <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> to discuss a national policy agenda with the eight parties in the Folketing as a prelude to formation of a governing coalition. Emerging from <LOCATION> Amalienborg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> pledged to `` strive to be totally neutral'' in searching `` for a government program supported by a broad majority.'' <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> was nominated by the socialist opposition to block <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> from the position. <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> won the backing of the Social-Liberals. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> submitted his resignation to the queen earlier Wednesday, a formal step to launch coalition jockeying. The monarch then held consultations with all the party leaders. After a second meeting with the queen in seven hours, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said a majority supported <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> to conduct the political talks, although he said he had `` strong reservations'' about using the office of parliamentary chairman `` in this political game.'' <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> is a former finance minister in a Social Democratic government. But his present position in the legislature is supposed to be above partisan politics. <PERSON> Jakobsen </PERSON> told reporters he would begin separate meetings with the parties on Thursday. Earlier, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said the first aim of negotiations should be to resolve the row which led to the election, the first vote in four decades to be fought on a foreign policy issue. He indicated he wants to revise the resolution, which requires the government to advise each visiting warship that nuclear weapons are barred from Danish ports. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say the resolution undermines their standing refusal to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear arms on military vessels. White House spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday that once a new Danish government is formed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will discuss with it the controversy over nuclear-armed ships in Danish waters. `` We have always had an excellent relationship with the government of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and expect that relationship will continue with the new government once it is formed,'' he said. In the election, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s four-party coalition won 70 seats, the same number it held before, and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> parties lost two for a total of 79. Social-Liberals dropped one seat and have 10 in the new chamber.

<TEXT>
 Shiite Moslem militias fought with artillery and tanks Wednesday, the sixth day of their battle for supremacy in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s battered sprawl of tin-roofed huts and jerry-built apartment houses. Police said 33 people were killed and 160 wounded, bringing total casualties to 187 dead and 532 wounded. The battle raged unchecked for eight hours. Heavy fighting continued after a truce Syrian and Iranian mediators called for 10:30 a.m. between the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Another truce was announced Wednesday night, the third in two days, and the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Presidents <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were forming a four-man committee to enforce a `` final cease-fire.'' An embassy statement said <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> reached agreement by telephone on a cease-fire to begin at 11 p.m. -LRB- 4 p.m. EDT -RRB- and deployment of truce observers. Another lull in the fighting occurred after the truce deadline. About 60 percent of the 250,000 inhabitants of the Shiite slums have fled. Those remaining huddled in basements and bomb shelters. Witnesses reported fires burning out of control, snipers shooting from rooftops at moving vehicles, ambulances under attack as they tried to pick wounded from the streets. Hospitals appealed for blood donations. The Sahel hospital, closest to the battle zone, told rescuers through Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio to take victims elsewhere because `` we ca n't cope with the flood of casualties.'' AP photographer <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> neighborhood, heard a woman shout through the shellfire: `` There is a wounded man here! He is dying! Help us, please! Take us out of here!'' No one could reach the building. The factional war reflects a contest between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for influence with the 1.2 million Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect. Its focus is a 16-square-mile enclave next to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport in which most of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held. Their captors in most cases are thought to be extremists linked to the radical <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. There has been no word on the fate of the captives, who include nine Americans. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` If the bloodletting continues, we will have no other option but to respond to the pleas of the population and end their ordeal.'' His statement was broadcast before the latest truce. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and, after 13 years of civil war, was the nation's undisputed power broker until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began challenging its influence. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent 7,500 of the soldiers into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to stop a factional battle primarily involving <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia. The Syrians drove <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> from some west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> strongholds but has not entered the southern slums. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s acting prime minister, accused militia leaders of `` providing criminals with the means of killing and destruction that burn a safe area.'' `` We hold the leaders responsible for all the crimes committed against humanity in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and urge them to order a cease-fire before it is too late,'' he said in a statement. A slum resident, in a telephone call to the Voice of the Nation, said: `` They are destroying our homes. They are killing our children. They -LRB- militias -RRB- claim they want to protect us, but we need to be protected from them. `` They've done worse than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did to us'' in the 1982 invasion, he said. `` We do n't have water, power or food and we do n't know where to go.'' A police spokesman said Amal forces led by tanks had dislodged <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters from several areas on the western edge of the slum, abutting the airport, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> overran the main Amal base east of the airport highway. Police said Amal brought 2,500 fighters from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the Tuesday truce to reinforce its 4,000 men in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s fighting strength in the area is estimated at 3,000.

<HEAD>Navy Asked To Probe Rash Of Crashes Involving Attack Bombers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they are weighing a request from two <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state congressmen to investigate a string of six crashes of the A-6 attack bomber that killed 10 people in the last year and a half. At least four of the crashes occurred during training runs and all involved bombers from the <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Reps. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, both Democrats, signed a letter Monday asking <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> to investigate, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Behan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>. Ball is reviewing the request, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Kippy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The latest crash took place May 5, about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, when a $ 32 million A-6E Intruder on a night mission hurtled into the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> at 400 mph to 500 mph, killing the pilot and bombardier-navigator. Less than a month earlier, a crash on the same training route claimed two lives. Since 1980, 27 <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> pilots and crew members have died in 25 crashes of the A-6 and its cousin, the EA-6B, said <PERSON> Mariana </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, base spokeswoman. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, has asked the staff to look into the crashes to determine whether congressional action is needed to alter the training of pilots or correct problems with the aircraft. `` After six times, I think it's time to find out about what's going on up there'' at <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said The base is on Puget Sound's <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` That's too many lives, too many planes,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said. The training mission in last week's crash involves heading out over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> at 20,000 feet, then dropping to 500 feet as the aircraft circles and heads inland, up and over the mountains toward a bombing range.

<HEAD>Scientists Says Chernobyl Left Psychological Scars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KIEV, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists said Wednesday that Soviets still suffer psychological scars from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster more than two years after it took place. Soviet and Western scientists could reach no consensus on the number of deaths that eventually may be linked to the explosion and fire that destroyed the No. 4 reactor at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power plant on April 26, 1986. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctor said cases of leukemia may begin to appear in one to three years. A Soviet scientist said the number of voluntary abortions in areas of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> near the plant increased 20 percent in the months after the accident. At least 31 people were killed at the plant 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. A huge cloud of invisible radiation spread over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and eventually worked its way around the world. Wednesday was the first day of three days devoted to a conference on medical consequences of the disaster. It brought more than 160 Soviet scientists together with delegates from 24 foreign countries. `` The accident was very severe but the wounds are healing,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Blix </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said nuclear plants remain a feasible source of electricity despite the accident. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>, the Soviet health minister, said in an opening statement: `` Soviet scientists have no reason to conceal anything about the accident.'' Several Soviet delegates said the nation must combat what they called `` radiophobia,'' an unreasonable fear of nuclear power. <PERSON> Oles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatak </PERSON>, deputy director of the Soviet Center for Radiation Medicine, said scientists had noted increases in tension and intestinal disorders attributable to stress, and the unwillingness of some couples to have children. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Knizhnikov </PERSON>, who heads a radiation-safety laboratory, said rumors arose periodically about the Chernobyl plant leaking radiation again. Reports in the official press have said public opposition halted construction of nuclear plants near <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Knizhnikov </PERSON> told reporters of a 20 percent increase in voluntary abortions in areas of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> just north of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> following the accident. He said there was no evidence of an increase in spontaneous abortions or birth defects, and virtually no chance any children would have been born deformed. The high rate of abortions continued through 1986 but the number then returned to normal, he said. Specialists have said the disaster could add 30,000 cancer deaths to the 600 million expected in the next 50 years, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctor who helped treat the worst cases of radiation sickness. Half the extra cases would be in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 40 percent in the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the remaining 10 percent in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> emphasized that the figures were estimates and said: `` My own feeling is that they may be on the high side, maybe by a factor of 10.'' An increase in leukemia also might be noticeable in one to three years among the 135,000 people who were evacuated from an 18-mile zone around the plant, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said. An extra 100 cases would be significant and easily detectable, he said, and `` one may be able to precisely identify the cases caused by radiation.'' Some other American doctors disputed that. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Mettler </PERSON>, a radiologist and specialist in nuclear medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, said there is no way to determine the cause of a particular case of cancer. Because of a lack of information about how much and what kinds of radiation people were exposed to, firm conclusions about the medical effects would be difficult to reach, he said. Soviet officials said they had not been prepared to deal with the Chernobyl accident and did not have enough trained workers or reliable equipment to monitor the radiation. The accident was not even reported until three days after it happened, when <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> detected high radiation levels and demanded an explanation. Their Western colleagues said the Soviets have done a good job since. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said modifications of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear plants now under way would prevent another accident of the Chernobyl type.

<HEAD>Connecticut Revives Lottery System After 24-Hour Shutdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s million-dollar-a-day lottery was revived late Wednesday after a 24-hour shutdown following the discovery that tickets could be bought after the winning numbers were announced. The company that provided new computers for the lottery `` assured us the problems have been fixed,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, assistant chief of the lottery unit of the Division of Special Revenue. Lottery officials said parts of the 2,200-terminal system were operating at 7:30 p.m. but did not know how long it would take to get all 2,200 terminals back on line. The new equipment went on line Sunday. The games were suspended Tuesday evening. The flaw in the system was demonstrated by two <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> ticket agents who saw Monday's televised drawing then played the winning numbers, officials said. The machines gave them tickets with numbers dated Monday instead of Tuesday. The pair, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON>, startled lottery officials Tuesday when they revealed what had happened and handed back $ 16,500 in checks that had just been made out in their names. Lottery unit spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said she did not know whether there were any other such incidents. Officials say codes of winning tickets can be checked if a problem is suspected. The state operates daily lottery and Play Four games and twice-weekly Lotto games with drawings on Tuesdays and Fridays. Tuesday's drawings were held and winners' tickets will be honored when the system resumes operating, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief of the Special Revenue lottery unit. The state sells $ 8 million in tickets a week and has a net weekly profit of $ 3 million, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The mixup compounded the headaches of the Division of Special Revenue, which was forced to shut down two jai alai frontons because of strike by players. The state gets $ 55,000 a day from jai alai wagering, officials say. Earlier Wednesday, some lottery agents reported unhappy customers. `` They're very angry about it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoztic </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION>'s Head News and Variety in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>. `` They think the store owners have something to do with it and do n't realize it's someone else's problem,'' <PERSON> Shoztic </PERSON> said. `` A few have said they would play in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the contract with the company that runs the lottery system, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hunt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, stipulates that the company will be penalized when the system is down for the amount of the state's lost profits. General Instrument took over the system from <ORGANIZATION> G-Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, when it was awarded a five-year, $ 40 million contract in December. General Instrument's bid was $ 11 million lower than <ORGANIZATION> G-Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s, according to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. General Instrument also runs the Off-Track Betting computer and ran the state's lottery system when it was begun in the early 1970s, he said. General Instrument officials did not immediately return calls placed to their <LOCATION> Wethersfield </LOCATION> office. The company also provides equipment for the 1,200-terminal <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lottery. Officials there said they experienced problems when the system went on line in 1986 but did not have to shut it down.

 About 50 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students, most of them black, ended an overnight `` study-in'' Wednesday, saying the dean had agreed to some of their demands for recruiting more minority professors. `` We feel we were very successful over the last 24 hours,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which staged the protest in the outer office of <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>. The students had demanded that additional black professors be hired and that <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>, who is retiring, be replaced by a black professor. They remained at <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>'s office overnight. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said the dean agreed to seven of 12 demands, including establishment of a fellowship to encourage blacks to teach at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; a policy statement expressing commitment to diversity in hiring, and a broader role for students in searching for and hiring minority faculty. <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls for comment. <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON> said he could not agree to demands to hire a tenured black female professor by 1989 or to increase the number of tenured faculty by 20 positions and filling them with professors from diverse backgrounds, <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON> also said he had no ability to fulfill the students' demand that he be replaced by <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a black professor at the law school, the student leader said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has 61 tenured positions, two held by blacks. Three black assistant professors, who do not have teunure, are on the staff.

 Seven members of a radical leftist group that used `` armed propaganda'' to protest government policies are charged with setting off bombs in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol and seven other locations, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The seven defendants are charged with conspiring to set off a bomb that blew a hole in a wall outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber on Nov. 7, 1983, and damaged five paintings, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said in a statement. The Capitol bomb also blew doors off the hinges outside the office of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, then the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader and now majority Explosives were also detonated at three Washington-area military installations and four locations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> between 1983 and 1985, including the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Patrolmen's <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> office as part of the group's campaign of `` armed propaganda,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said The bombings damaged the buildings but did not injure anyone. The indictment was unsealed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the same day that one of the defendants, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, 40, was convicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of murder, armed robbery and racketeering in two 1981 armored truck robberies that resulted in the deaths of two guards and two <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, N.Y policemen. Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> drove a getaway car in the unsuccessful robbery of a Brink's armored truck carrying $ 1.6 million in <LOCATION> Nanuet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> on Oct. 20, 1981. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 41, one of the seven named in the April 20 indictment, is serving a sentence for harboring Ms. Buck when she was a fugitive wanted for the Brinks heist. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> also was sentenced last year to 40 years imprisonment for illegally buying guns in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1983. Federal authorities said they waited to unseal the five-count indictment until Ms. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>'s trial had ended in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. All but one of the defendants named in the five-count indictment unsealed Wednesday are in custody on other charges, federal officials said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, the seventh defendant, is a fugitive, officials said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> fled while awaiting trial on similar charges. The indictment identified the defendants as members of a group that variously called itself the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> and the Red Guerrilla Resistance. The Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for the Capitol bombing to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and involvement of Marines in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Other defendants named were: <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>. Besides the Capitol bombing, the group is charged with setting off a bomb outside the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION> here on April 26, 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 18, 1983 and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on April 20, 1984. Bombs were also placed at the Federal Building on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 28, 1983; the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 5, 1984; and the South African consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 26, 1984. The bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> occurred on Feb. 23, 1985 The indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy, malicious damage of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property and aiding and abetting. As part of the conspiracy, the indictment charged, the group conducted surveillances of other potential bombing targets including: the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House; the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md.; and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, Md Explosives and weapons, including dynamite, water gel, and other material were stored in a <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> storage bin and in a garage in <LOCATION> Doylestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, the indictment said. The blast in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol occurred at about midnight and blew a hole in the wall across a corridor from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> concluded that three or four pounds of dynamite with a dual-release timer was placed beneath a bench in an alcove in the corridor outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber. It caused numerous cracks in the walls and the ornate ceiling of the corridor but did not leave any lasting structural damage to the Capitol. The indictment did not identify which members of the conspiracy set off the bomb in the Capitol. After the bombing, a communique was mailed to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a local public radio station, <ORGANIZATION> WAMU </ORGANIZATION>, that said: `` We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling class. We did not choose to kill any of them this time. But their lives are not sacred,'' the indictment said. Credit was also claimed in communiques or calls to news organizations for the other bombings to dramatize the group's political goals, the indictment said In his statement, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said the defendants were charged with being part of `` a secret organization which described itself as ` a communist politico-military organization' and which operated under the names <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> and the Red Guerrilla Resistance.'' To protest government foreign and domestic policies, the members of the group `` would plan and carry out acts of violence, which they called ` armed propaganda,' including the bombing of various government and private buildings and property.'' The indictment charged that the members of the group used multiple aliases derived from the names of babies who died in the late 1940s and early 1950s to obtain false passports, driver's licenses as well as to get jobs, buy firearms and impersonate police officers The group armed itsef with <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachine guns, shotguns, handguns, silencers and such accessories as bulletproof body armor. <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON> used a bogus search warrant to stage a Sept. 2, 1984 armed robbery of a <LOCATION> Cromwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, supermarket, the indictment said. Other potential targets said to be subjects of surveillance were the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the law offices of <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herlong </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Summit Aviation in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, was also the subject of surveillance and training exercises for the bombing missions, the indictment charged. <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and Buck were charged with conspiracy, while all seven defendants were charged with malicious destruction of property in connection with the bombings of the Capitol and the three <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> military facilities. `` Let this be a warning to those who seek to influence the policies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government through violence and terrorism that we will seek unrelentingly to bring them to justice,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said in his statement. `` Those who attack our sacred institutions of government and seek to destroy the symbols of our democratic system ultimately will have to pay the price.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON>, 30, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were sentenced to 58 years imprisonment for possession of 600 pounds of weapons and explosives seized during their arrest Nov. 29, 1985 in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. They were arrested while placing the explosives into a rented storage bin. <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, a physician, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year by a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> federal judge for possesion of explosives, weapons and false identity cards. <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON>'s was convicted of making false identity cards and possessing firearms. Buck, meanwhile, faces a maximum life sentence for her participation in the two Brink's robbberies in 1981. She and <PERSON> Mutulu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakur </PERSON> were also convicted of murder in death of a Brink's guard killed during a June, 1981 armored truck robbery in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. The robberies were part of a string of attempted robberies and robberies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to rein in some of the cable television industry's power to control the entertainment marketplace. But leaders of the cable TV industry dismissed the movie industry's concerns and rejected charges that cable TV has become an unregulated monopoly. At a hearing marked by a few lively exchanges, <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> sparred with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cable company. `` Cable is no longer a babe in swaddling clothes,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications, which is looking into the effects of cable deregulation. Cable TV, he said, has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry dominated by several large companies. `` Consumers are held hostage by their cable system. They have no alternative. They can either commit suicide or go bowling,'' said <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, who represents the major <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios and independent producers. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> defended their industry, saying it has brought more than 50 basic channels and more than a dozen pay channels to television viewers in more than half the country. `` Before cable, we had the three big networks and they dominated what people saw. Now there are the three networks and more than 50 cable channels,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. More than 80 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s TV households can receive cable, and about 52 percent of all households subscribe. The steady increase in cable subscribership and in the amount of cable-exclusive programming has cut into the audience of the broadcast networks and the receipts of movie theaters. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the cable industry has become the mouse that roared,'' able to raise rates at will and decide what broadcast signals to carry. <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a law requiring cable companies to carry local broadcast signals and prohibit cable companies from showing any syndicated program for which a local broadcaster has purchased exclusive rights. As cable's clout has grown, it has been winning contracts away from the broadcast networks to carry more and more major sports events, and Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, wondered whether in the future average sports fans will have to subscribe to cable to watch their home teams play. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> suggested that while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could pass a law to protect broadcast coverage of sports events, it would be more prudent to `` wait to see what the free market does.'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>'s claim that cable TV is a monopoly. For movies, he said, consumers can go to the theater, rent video cassettes or watch them on the broadcast networks. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> also defended the investment his company and other large cable companies have made in industry programming ventures, saying that without this investment many of these channels would have gone out of business. He cable companies helped shore up The Discovery Channel and Turner's enterprise. <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, however, said such investments give cable companies incentive to carry on their systems the services in which they have an equity stake, denying viewers other programming choices. `` These monopolies can decide what the consumer is going to see,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said.

 The city of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> endangers its police force by failing to equip officers properly, a prosecutor said Wednesday at the opening of a trial on criminal charges of reckless conduct against the city. But Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> countered in afternoon testimony: `` I know of no officer of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> police department required to go to work if they felt their safety was endangered.'' The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city, plagued by unemployment, crime and a growing municipal debt, is accused of failing to supply its seven-member patrol force with properly working radios and cars. Officials said it was the first <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city to be tried on criminal charges. Convictions would carry fines of $ 1,000 on each of nine misdemeanor counts, filed Feb. 22 by the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney. State's Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeChien </ORGANIZATION> that some police had bought their own radios and that detectives had used their own cars. The city `` was aware of the situation and recklessly ignored'' it, <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said. The city had the money to correct the problems but failed to do so, he said. He said he planned to call about 30 witnesses. The mayor testified the police-radio problems were routine. `` They are mechanical equipment. They are manmade; they break down,'' he said. He contended some of the vehicle problems were due to abuse by the police. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> contended Wednesday that there were no local, state or federal regulations saying municipalities must provide officers with radios. Officer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggaman </PERSON>, a 16 -LCB- - year <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> police veteran, testified that he felt endangered by problems with the radios and cars <PERSON> Waggaman </PERSON> said he bought his own portable radio in 1983 because the police radio did not transmit or receive properly. He said he was not reimbursed. <PERSON> Waggaman </PERSON> said he informed his shift commander repeatedly of the problems, which included cars with bald tires and low oil and without spotlights. During cross examination, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said there were no regulations to define what a `` properly equipped'' vehicle was. `` It's a luxury, is it not?'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Waggaman </PERSON>, referring to the radios. `` It's for the convenience of the officer.'' <PERSON> Waggaman </PERSON> said he knew of no regulations governing the equipment. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a former alderman and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, testified that Police Chief <PERSON> Isadore </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told the panel on numerous occasions that new police equipment was needed. Chambers has said that while the force has six radios for its patrol cars, he often had as many as seven uniformed officers on the streets. When a seventh officer is available, two members of the force must share a car so both have access to a radio. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, once a thriving industrial city, became one of the nation's poorest with the decline of the industries and the exodus of whites in the 1960s. Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive some kind of public assistance, and about 40 percent of its citizens are unemployed. Officials say the city's financial problems show no sign of subsiding. It recently reached a $ 4 million settlement with a man seriously beaten by another inmate in the city jail in 1985.

<TEXT>
 A biologist said Wednesday that a newly discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth cancer-causing virus and appears to work with the AIDS virus in wiping out the immune system of AIDS victims. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of tumor-cell biology, said more evidence was needed before the highly contagious Herpes 6, or human B-lymphocyte virus, could be blamed for causing certain types of cancers. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> spoke at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>, which convened here Sunday. Researchers have found a high prevalence of antibodies to the Herpes 6 virus in people with <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease, <PERSON> Burkitt </PERSON>'s lymphoma, <PERSON> non-Hodgkin </PERSON>'s lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said `` One could argue the virus must be playing a role to be detected so readily in those tumors,'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. Currently, five other viruses are believed to cause cancer. They are hepatitis B, which can cause liver cancer; Epstein-Barr, which can cause nasopharyngeal cancer; HTLV, which can cause leukemia; papillomavirus, which may cause cervical cancer; and cytomegalovirus, linked to prostate cancer. The Herpes 6 virus also has been found alongside the AIDS virus in T-4 cells, which mastermind the immune system and are the prime target of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. Since the AIDS virus kills only a small percentage of T-4 cells at a time, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said, the new herpes virus might explain the total annihilation of T-4 cells in AIDS patients. Tests to detect <ORGANIZATION> Herpes </ORGANIZATION> 6 have differed widely on its prevalence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One test indicated that it is carried by between 5 percent and 30 percent of the population; another indicated between 70 percent and 90 percent.

 Jurors who convicted a woman of killing two people with cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules will return to court Friday for a hearing on allegations of jury tampering, a judge ruled Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> granted a request to question the 12 jurors by defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who cited an anonymous telephone call allegedly received by a juror during deliberations.

Both had swallowed Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules containing cyanide in 1986. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said the court by law must look into any allegations of jury tampering, but he emphasized that in ordering the hearing, he was `` not suggesting in the slightest any misconduct by any juror.'' He invited <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> to submit questions to him. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said he would question jurors himself under oath. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, a juror, had told the judge before the verdict that a female caller told her Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed a lie detector test, information that had not been allowed as evidence in the three-week trial. The judge let Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> stay on the jury after she said the call would not influence her. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> concurred with that decision at the time. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> on Wednesday argued against the need for questioning, saying any inference of misconduct was `` pure speculation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of life in prison at sentencing June 17.

 The 41st <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> opened Wednesday evening with a gentle rain falling on a parade of beautiful people. French actress <PERSON> Sandrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnaire </PERSON> declared the start of the two-week movie gala. This year's festival, which runs through May 23, is billed as a quieter affair than last year's 40th anniversary extravaganza, but enough big names were on hand to satisfy the star-spotters gathered on the famous seaside promenade La Croisette. Actress <PERSON> Nastassja </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinski </PERSON>, dressed in rose taffeta, drew cries of admiration upon her arrival. She is one of the nine members of the festival jury, which is headed this year by veteran Italian director <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scola </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bonnaire </PERSON> pronounced the festival open from the Palais des Festivals, known as `` the cake'' for its layered structure. But the stars in everyone's minds were the dolphins, the stars of `` Le Grand Bleu,'' the naturalist movie selected for the opening night celebrations. French director <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Besson </PERSON> kept his film under close wraps and Wednesday night was its first public showing. `` Le Grand Bleu'' stars American actress <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON>, who played alongside <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> in `` Desperately Seeking <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>.'' Her co-star is <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> who plays the French diver <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayol </PERSON>, who dives without oxygen bottles.

The background is one of religious upheaval and inquisitions. In an effort to encourage new talent in the cinema, the festival jury has selected a number of films by young directors. `` A World Apart,'' a story of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is the first film made under the direction of <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Menges </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menges </PERSON> made his name in the cinema as a director of photography, working with leading directors such as <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> on the movie `` Mission.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emerging film industry is represented by the film, `` King of Children.'' This is the first time a Chinese film has been included in the official selection at <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. Another Far Eastern film selected by the jury, is <PERSON> Kiju </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s `` Onimaru,'' from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> The film promises a new regard on the novel `` Wuthering Heights'' by the English romanticist, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronte </PERSON>. `` Three Sisters'' by German director <PERSON> Margarethe </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotta </PERSON>, is billed as a modern adaptation of the <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekov </PERSON> play.

 Security forces and <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants ceased fire Wednesday as negotiations began to end the three-day siege of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, police and witnesses said. Up to 12 people were killed during the siege that started Monday after Sikh militants began firing from the Golden Temple complex at police posts on nearby rooftops. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, five people were killed in attacks late Tuesday night and early Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The head Sikh priest, <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, held inconclusive talks with senior police officials late Wednesday as 2,500 paramilitary troops around the 400-year-old temple and an estimated 100 Sikh militants inside stopped firing. `` We have many options,'' Punjab Gov. <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> told a news conference, referring to the talks. He did not elaborate. Militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland since 1982. Although a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s total population of 800 million people. The Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who make up 82 percent of the nationwide population. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent allowed inside the shrine saw the decomposing bodies of three men and one woman. Sikh militants said the four were shot by security men firing from rooftops. Militants holding automatic weapons huddled behind marble pillars and vowed to carry on their resistance. `` We will continue to die but we shall never be destroyed,'' said Sikh militant <PERSON> Nirvair </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Young Sikhs, most yet to sprout a beard, were seen carrying automatic weapons and chanting `` Sikhs will rule!'' Earlier plans to lift a curfew in most of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>'s old walled city failed, police officer <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. The curfew was ordered Monday when Sikh extremists began firing from the temple complex at rooftop police posts. <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of police, said at least 10 people have died and 10 have been injured since violence began Monday. But Sikh militants inside the shrine said at least 12 people have died. Three people were killed early Wednesday in a heavy exchange of fire between extremists in the temple complex and security forces. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, minister of state for home affairs, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday `` other forces'' were being moved to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. He did not elaborate. The Home Ministry is responsible for internal security. The army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to drive Sikh extremists from the shrine. Later that year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge. Reports said Wednesday that police cut off electricity and water to the temple. <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> city officials said lines were down but said militants had cut them. Government spokesman J.F. <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said extremists cut electrical lines Tuesday night to make sure no lights inside the shrine would illuminate their positions. He said this also cut the water supply, as electricity is needed to operate the system's pumps. More than 800 pilgrims were evacuated from the complex Tuesday to keep them out of the crossfire. The complex covers an area equivalent to more than five city blocks. The temple is located in the center of a pool.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Wednesday a nine-day shipyard strike failed because it lacked nationwide support, but `` if necessary, we will try again.'' The government said it did not plan to punish the strikers. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> enacted a law giving the government special powers to speed its program of economic reform, which inspired more than two weeks of strikes. The law retained the right of official trade unions to strike. Strikers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is an electrician, sought recognition of a local chapter of Solidarity, which was outlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981. About 1,000 workers who had occupied the yard without working, the method strikers use in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, marching out Tuesday behind <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, ending the job action. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> founded Solidarity, the first independent labor federation in the Soviet bloc, during a summer of labor turmoil that followed price increases in 1980. Wednesday was <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first strike-free day since April 24. The labor unrest, involving six major strikes, was the worst since the martial law crackdown on Solidarity. A major impetus for the strikes was the reduction or removal of government subsidies, which increased prices of necessities an average of 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. Strikers demanded pay raises of up to 60 percent, and some were granted. Premier <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> referred to the strikes, and to protests at several universities, when he introduced the Special Powers Act in Parliament. He linked the unrest in part to dissatisfaction with the pace of economic reform and declared: `` A decided section of the nation.. displayed a praiseworthy sense of responsibility'' by not striking. `` The government knows many groups of the population still live poorly, but none of the existing conflicts or any of the key social and economic issues will be resolved by resorting to illegal strikes,'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 382-0 with two abstentions. It gives the government the right to take over enterprises or fire managers who resist attempts to change the economic system. It also lets the government intervene in setting prices and wages. It did not include a provision in an earlier draft that would have abolished for this year the already limited right of official unions to strike. The law is intended to counteract bureaucratic resistance to economic reforms, make wages and prices more realistic, reduce centralized controls, increase competition and foster private and managerial enterprise. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, said stopping the strike `` showed our strength as well as our helplessness.'' Lack of support from the rest of the country hurt the strike, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. `` At times we were paralyzed because there were so few of us,'' he said. `` If there are people who think we lost, it is because we still lack solidarity'' among workers nationwide. Addressing reporters at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s church near the shipyard, he said: `` If necessary we will try again. Nothing ended. Nothing is finished.'' He said the 15-member shipyard strike committee that held five rounds of negotiations with management would not be dissolved. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone the decision to give up the strike was `` judicious'' and `` so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.'' Asked what the government planned to do to the strikers, he said: `` I can declare on behalf of the government that our policy will be a positively non-repressive policy.'' Urban said he was making the statement in principle and could not guarantee the policy would encompass `` all the possible cases.'' Some shipyard supervisors were back on the job Wednesday and officials said normal work would resume Thursday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was telephoned at home and asked why he was not at work and replied that he did n't know he was supposed to be. Referring to his pledge during the strike to be the last to leave the yard, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the journalists: `` I said I would leave as the last one. Maybe I will go back as the last one too. Maybe I'll ask for a vacation.'' A commentary by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the end of the strike showed the `` myth about Solidarity's might has fallen,'' but strike committee chairman <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> took this view: `` When the strikers were leaving the yard, I could see Solidarity's revival.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential bid his long-awaited endorsement Wednesday night, saying `` I intend to campaign as as hard as I can'' for his vice president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement, delivered at a $ 1,500-a-plate Republican fund-raising dinner, came hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the support of his only remaining presidential rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Although the president's backing was never in doubt, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as titular head of the party remained officially neutral while the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race was contested, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clinched the nomination two weeks ago. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his audience of 3,000 Republicans: `` I intend to campaign as hard as I can. My candidate is a former member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and national chairman of the Republican party.'' `` I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was breaking `` a silence I've maintained for some time with regard to the presidential candidates. The president's terse endorsment came at the end of a speech in which he cited the accomplishments of his adminstration. He mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> three times, and on one of those occasions referred to him as `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosh </PERSON>.'' `` Eight years ago, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I said to the American people, ` the time is now.' It still is. The story of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is one of people who have made their dreams come true, by realizing that the time for action is always now,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. At the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined him at the podium and the two held clasped hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who spoke before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, praised the president, saying: `` You began a great national renewal. What an inspiration you have been to all of us _ your simple humanity, your decency, your strength.'' Earlier, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> waved from a second-floor balconey in the Old Executive Office Building, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> drive below that he had given his endorsement to the vice president during a private session. `` I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race is pretty much over,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The former television minister has won only 46 delegates in the Republican primary and caucus competition. He said he was waiting until Monday so his supporters would have a shot at winning additional national convention seats at <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses this weekend in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I did n't ask anything for myself. I spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of 1988,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` We definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he would work to get his supporters to back him. In a prelude to his formal endorsement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his intentions known at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders in the Cabinet Room earlier Wednesday. The Republican leaders applauded when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> entered the room. Vanquished Republican presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who attended the session, later had some advice for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> which he shared with reporters. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would `` have to build on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record, build on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> constituency, try to hold it if you can. But sooner or later, you're going to be out there running as _ it's going to be the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vision for the future. And I think that will develop in time. I think he can do it.'' On more specific advice on what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have to do in the coming months to get elected, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I think I'll leave that to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He did enough _ he took care of me all right.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the president's endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` the warmest of political embraces. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even before the Republican convention in August. `` I'm sure once we return from the summit -LRB- in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2 -RRB- there will be a number of events this summer,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s blessing comes two weeks after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won sufficient Republican convention delegates to lock up the party nomination.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned their campaigns west on Wednesday toward final primaries in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, both firmly in command and focusing on the fall. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a move that surprised no one, bestowed his official blessing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told 3,000 Republican faithful at a $ 1,500-a-plate fund-raising dinner Wednesday night. `` I intend to campaign as hard as I can,'' said the president. In endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was breaking `` a silence I've maintained for some time with regard to the presidential candidates. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to the podium and the two held their clasped hands in the air as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling. The lone remaining Republican opponent, television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, bowed to the obvious at last and offered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would suspend his own candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on Monday, weeks after he had ceased active campaigning against the vice president. Later, however, his campaign said he would discuss his campaign status on Monday, but quoted <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as saying he is not withdrawing from the race or releasing his delegates. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered a political tease of sorts when he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked into the Cabinet Room to meet with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders earlier Tuesday. `` I just have a very brief announcement to make,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign tonight.'' With two fresh primary wins in his column, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took a high-speed train ride and denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not supporting rail service. `` One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we have been spending the last eight years without a national transportation policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with a mathematical lock on the GOP convention, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the Democratic nomination, were both flying to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Thursday to begin campaign swings. Both planned visits to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ahead of Tuesday's primary there, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which ends the primary season June 7 along with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. A Gallup poll of likely Democratic voters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> released Wednesday indicated a big <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead, 67 percent to 26 percent for remaining rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and shook off resounding primary losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appeared before reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and said he had given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement in a private meeting and would get out of the race. `` I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race is pretty much over,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who won only 46 delegates in a campaign that spent more than $ 20 million. He said `` I did n't ask anything for myself,'' and promised to work to have his supporters back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked if he would run again in 1992 if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loses this fall, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: `` It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he soon may return to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the presidency. He said contributions and viewers have dropped dramatically in the last year. `` I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that they would be able to run <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> in my absence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Virginian-Pilot and <PERSON> Ledger-Star </PERSON>. `` I did not realize that my personal presence on ` The 700 Club' was as important as it is to the audience.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, rode two high-speed trains being tested for use between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for what he said was no national transportation policy and a failure to support <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. He rode the trains from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and back, a 50-mile one-way trip that the train covered in 32 minutes. He said equipment needed for hourly service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would cost about $ 200 million. `` This is a very, very modest investment for what could be and should be a profitable service,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to about 1,800 students at the predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. He exhorted them to reject drugs and violence, and afterward led a 15-block anti-drug march from the school through one of the city's most crime-ridden areas. `` You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of your life, and you can make a difference,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted he was in the race until the end, despite two more landslide wins by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Tuesday night including a delegate shutout of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has moved within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to nail down the Democratic nomination. According to the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 1,589 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 944.

 One of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s last paintings before his suicide, an 1890 portrait of his innkeeper's teen-age daughter, sold at auction Wednesday for a disappointing $ 13.7 million. `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>,'' sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house, was expected by art expects to bring $ 15 million. The anonymous buyer bid by telephone, paying the fourth highest price at auction for a painting. The three highest prices were all for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON>. The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> committed suicide at age 37 in 1890 in the village of <LOCATION> Auvers </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In an essay written when she was in her 70s, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> described the artist's final hours as he lay in his room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound. Interest in the painting was keen, experts had said before the auction, in part because it serves as a link to the artist's last days. But the standing-room-only crowd was still after the final bid; there was no applause as is customary when a high price is paid for an artwork in which interest has been expressed prior to the sale. `` Bidding was n't too spirited. The price was disappointing,'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who was interested in bidding for a client or himself. <PERSON> Auctioneer </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, called the sale `` a wonderful price for a beautiful picture.'' The bidding started at $ 6 million. The $ 13.75 million included the 10 percent commission paid to the auction house. The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer purchased it at a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction for $ 1.98 million. Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> _ who sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world. In March 1987, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' sold for $ 39.9 million at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a Japanese insurance company. Three months later, `` The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $ 20.2 million, also at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It was bought by an unidentified collector in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Then, in November, history was made when <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises,'' a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a single white iris, sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for $ 53.9 million to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a painting. In the painting auctioned Wednesday, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON>, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in front of her. `` He observed her very deeply, and when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>, senior vice president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s and an expert on impressionist and modern painting. But Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a 1956 essay that she did n't immediately appreciate the painting. `` I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait; it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> wrote. However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying, `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> described <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, who lived at her father's inn during the last 2 -LCB- months of his life, as a disciplined artist and `` a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister. She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother, <PERSON> Theo </PERSON>, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the train station, his face `` distorted by grief.'' At the same auction Wednesday, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON>'s sculpture of three walking men, `` Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $ 3.8 million, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century sculpture. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s painting `` L'Ombrelle'' of a woman sitting in a garden with an umbrella in her hand brought $ 6.6 million. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassatt </PERSON>'s painting `` The Conversation,'' of two women talking to each other, sold for $ 4.51 million, a record for the artist.

 A witness testified Wednesday that a man accused in 16 slayings spoke of settling scores a month before a shooting rampage that left two dead. `` He said he had a few people in town he'd like to get even with,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON>, a bakery route salesman, said before the prosecution rested its case against <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is charged with capital murder, attempted capital murder and kidnapping during a 45-minute shooting rampage Dec. 28 in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> used two .22 - caliber revolvers that day to kill <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, who friends say once rejected <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' amorous attention, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, who apparently was a Police said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had a grudge against most of the people he is accused of shooting. Others were wounded that day as four <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> businesses were terrorized by a pistol-wielding intruder. After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered, police found the bodies of 14 relatives, including his wife, his children and grandchildren, at his home near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. Police said they were killed during the Christmas holidays. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is to be tried July 18 in their deaths. <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> made the comments about getting even during conversation at the convenience store where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> worked. `` <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was the only name he called,'' <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said, referring to one of the four people <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is accused of wounding. Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said the defense would have only two or three witnesses. The defense opens its case Thursday. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Butts </PERSON>, assisted to and from the witness box by her husband, identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> in the courtroom and said they had a bad encounter once when both worked at a freight company after she admonished him to do a better job. `` He got angry,'' she said. `` He screamed, he shouted across the office that he did n't get paid enough. Mrs. <PERSON> Butts </PERSON> said the shooting resulted in nightmares. `` I see things, scary,'' she said. `` I hear things. I see people. They do n't have faces. They're after me.'' <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who the prosecution says was taken hostage after Mrs. <PERSON> Butts </PERSON> was shot at the freight company, recalled saying to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, `` Gene, please do n't shoot me, please do n't shoot me.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said she was cowering when <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, holding a gun to her right temple, took her by the right arm and told her to get up. `` <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON>, I'm not going to hurt you,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> told her, `` I came to kill <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. I got everybody that hurt me. I'm not going to hurt you. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> put down one of the two pistols, but he kept the other one pointed at her and would not let her leave. She added: `` Because he said he did n't want the police barreling in there or barging in there. ... I guess he thought they would n't shoot him if they had me there. He refused to give her the other gun, she said.

 <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s authoritarian government canceled a meeting between Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and civil leaders scheduled for next week, but a church group said Wednesday it will try to go ahead with the assembly. No meeting has been canceled on such short notice on any of the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s 36 previous foreign tours, and the incident raised new tensions between the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and the government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on Wednesday visited <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s desolate high plains, where he listened to the lament of jobless miners and poverty-ravaged peasants and pledged the church's support. The meeting next Tuesday was to be held in a government-owned sports stadium in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> and was intended to bring the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians. They were to include peasants, lawyers, religious leaders and members of opposition parties not recognized by the government. The invitations to opposition leaders prompted government criticism. Patria, the daily newspaper of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Sunday described the meeting as a `` corrupt assembly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Patria </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that government officials, citing `` security reasons,'' notified the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s local envoy that the meeting had been canceled. The <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it would search for another site. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is due to meet <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> soon after the pontiff arrives from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> next Monday. The pope is on a 13-day tour of four <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries _ <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> declined comment about the cancellation of the meeting. `` For the moment, I have nothing to say,'' said <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, traveling with the pope. The government and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s bishops were at odds over the planning of the pope's visit and there was little cooperation between them. The church has criticized the government and its human rights record. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>, has provided air time to government opponents. In the mining city of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, Wednesday, an unemployed tin miner, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alborte </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartagna </PERSON>, wailed as he addressed the pope on a stage, `` We are dying of hunger, Father. Help us ... We do n't have even a piece of bread. The miner, who has three children, placed a steel mining hat on the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s head as tears streamed down the miner's face. The gesture drew cheers from an audience estimated by the church at 160,000, many dressed in old or patched clothing. <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, with an unemployment rate easily double the national average of 22 percent, is considered the center of misery in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The country is the poorest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Later, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said a Mass for more than 200,000 people after returning to <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>. In a meeting with priests and seminarians he praised foreign priests working in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, saying: `` You are exercising your ministry with sacrifice and generosity in this, your adoptive country.'' A group of Bolivian bishops complained to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> last month about the appointment of three foreign-born bishops. Of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 834 priests, 634 are foreigners Later, the pope urged 22,000 young people in a <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION> sports stadium to avoid the temptations of drugs, sex and Marxism. <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, a cocaine trafficking center in the country's principal coca-growing region, called the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION>, is plagued by increasing drug use among the young Coca processing is outlawed in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, but the country's drug industry supplies an estimated one-third of the cocaine that arrives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was greeted by brass bands and groups of dancers in multicolored sequined costumes and garishly painted masks with twisting horns. Under blue skies, the pontiff addressed the crowd from a tall stage that provided a clear view of the state-run <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> mine, from which most workers have been fired in a government austerity program. `` I know of the many workers who have been displaced from their jobs,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` The deep mines that years ago were the great source of national wealth ... are now only mute witnesses to so many lives silently consumed there.'' The Bolivian church has been criticized by the country's conservative government for backing the social security demands of jobless miners and peasants Because of a collapse in world tin prices, the government of President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> shut down 14 of the 21 state-owned mines, leaving 21,500 of 27,000 miners without jobs.

 The government denied Wednesday that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had agreed to step down as armed forces commander and leave the country in return for dismissal of charges against him in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal court. An administration source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had offered to drop drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in return for the general's retirement and exile. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of the government's National Information System, or <ORGANIZATION> SNI </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> there have been simple conversations on diverse subjects. There has been no agreement about anything. `` Upon being informed of the existence of such reports, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> SNI </ORGANIZATION> categorically, `` The sovereignty of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not negotiable and is indeclinable,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said. He continued: `` Such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation. These reports form part of the confusion and confrontation provoked by certain elements of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment.'' The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Panapress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said that `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> entered in direct contact with General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The agency did not elaborate. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, when asked if that meant <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke by telephone with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said he did not know. The source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that under the proposed deal <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would step down, probably in August, and he would stay out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until after the next presidential elections there. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since he was indicted in federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed a variety of economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in recent months to try to hasten the departure of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is considered the power behind <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawyers, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that he was unaware of the alleged deal. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Tuesday in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> had told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday: `` At the moment there are no plans for his -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s -RRB- retirement.'' <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he had no knowledge of the alleged deal. Asked if <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday with the general or his representatives, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said, `` No comment.''

 The first spike in bank-lending rates since the October stock market crash jolted Wall Street on Wednesday, heralding a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars.

The prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interest rates elsewhere.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Supercarrier,'' launched earlier this spring, immediately ran into heavy weather from the critics. The show, set aboard the fictitious USS Georgetown, has been called a ripoff _ and a not particularly good one _ of the hit movie `` Top Gun.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, after looking at a few scripts, hoisted anchor and withdrew all support. Without the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the show could no longer film aboard the carrier or aloft with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planes. In the ratings, after six showings, `` Supercarrier'' ranks 68th of 105 shows. Not great, but not so terrible, either, against the likes of `` Murder, She Wrote'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and `` Family Ties'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. And the ratings increase slightly in the half-hour after `` Family Ties.'' `` Supercarrier'' carries on using a sound stage in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and more than 50 miles from the nearest <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base. `` People ask how we can do a show about an aircraft carrier without <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> support,'' said executive producer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>. `` Even when we had <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> support we only spent two weeks on a carrier. It's very hard. `` We went to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and spent a fortune waiting to get on the <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON>. Then we had to go to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> to get on the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The day we were to shoot at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> we had to cancel because of Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> coming in. It cost us $ 30,000. `` Add that to what we spent in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and that's a lot of money down the drain chasing the chimera of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cooperation. So, we've been faking it.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> said it was not the proposed story lines that caused the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to drop its cooperation, as had been reported. `` The stories the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supposedly rejected never existed,'' he said. `` We never had a story about the captain falling in love with a woman pilot. The information we're getting is that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s air arm, the ` brown shoes,' did n't like the show. And the reason they did n't like it was that it is n't just about the pilots, as ` Top Gun' was. `` We have a lot of characters who are ` black shoe' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and we hear they're delighted with the show. We have a lot of regular sailors that young people can identify with. Kids see ` Top Gun,' but they know they'll never go to college and never be an aviator.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the show, was being pulled in different directions by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could never articulate exactly what it wanted,'' he said. `` But they did say once they wanted us to show the crew off-duty and at home. The network wanted the ship at sea and the planes in the air.'' The premise for `` Supercarrier,'' based loosely on the book of the same name by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, is a good one. It focuses not only on the pilots, but on the crew as well, from the captain down to the newest member. The problem comes in the stories, which on some occasions seem to have been salvaged from `` Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.'' The show's characters come off as cartoons. You do n't become involved with them the way you do with the people on `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' another <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> military series that's doing much better in the ratings. In one episode two pilots from the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> were duped by two beautiful young women into flying a cargo plane to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The plane was carrying guns stolen from the carrier. The pilots should have been court-martialed for stupidity. The carrier was used to evacuate people from an island threatened by either a volcano or a rebel army. It was impossible to tell which. One sailor learned he had inadvertently proposed marriage to an island girl _ something to do with goats. All it needed was <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Montez </PERSON> and someone to say, `` Give me the cobra jewel.'' The last episode has something to do with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> gold recovered from a sunken ship by archaeologists. But there's more. It's packed in poisoned grain, and it gets into the carrier's water system. Where is <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> when you need him?

<HEAD>Air Force Tries to Put Brakes on Sonic Boom Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three ear-shattering booms mark the flight of an F-111 thundering at supersonic speed just 200 feet above a test range in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle. The fighter-bomber drops an experimental bomb, then the pilot yanks the throttle back to idle, cutting the jet's thrust 90 percent. In seconds, the plane's speed drops from 940 mph to just under 600 _ a radical maneuver designed to limit noise and damage from sonic booms. Without it, windows might have shattered in <LOCATION> Holley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, which lie near the end of the range; with it, residents might not even hear the booms. `` It's such a violent deceleration we are actually thrown forward in the cockpit, held back by our seat straps,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> in an interview. `` We try our best to be good neighbors. We do n't want to go around breaking people's windows.'' <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON>, a test pilot from <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was describing a typical mission at Mach 1.2, or just over the speed of sound, at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s only supersonic test range in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The special low-level missions test non-nuclear weaponry being developed here, including so-called smart bombs that glide to their targets with pinpoint accuracy. Col. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON>'s chief claims officer, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> nationwide received 265 claims for $ 465,138 in the 1987 budget year, but paid only $ 67,003 for 160 claims deemed valid while denying 80. Some claims carry over to the next year. Eglin accounted for 27 of the valid claims and $ 4,931 in damages, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> records show. But it has been worse in the past. A single boom in 1984 produced 34 claims that cost Eglin $ 15,865. The only other places where the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> permits low-level supersonic flights are <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and certain other desert areas in the West, <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said. But none is as close to populated areas as Eglin's Range B-70. <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION> lie just five to seven miles to the west. The 13-mile-long range is in the western half of a 720-square-mile military reservation, about 10 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, once billed as `` Home of the Sonic Boom.'' Local newspapers and radio stations carry <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> news releases about impending supersonic flights so residents wo n't be startled if they hear the booms, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman in <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION>'s public affairs office. He said missions have been canceled when the releases failed to make the newspapers. Predicting the strength of sonic booms is an inexact science that depends on such variables as aircraft size, speed, altitude and weather factors including wind, air pressure and temperature, <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said. Temperature inversions are the most serious complication, capable of bouncing the sonic shock waves great distances. <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said inversions have been suspected of breaking windows as far away as downtown <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, about 30 miles to the west. The F-111 is the largest of several types of aircraft used in low-level supersonic testing and thus produces the loudest and most damaging booms. An aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound generally creates three shock waves, one by its nose, another by its midsection and the third by its tail, <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said. Shock waves are caused when air molecules can not get out of the way of a plane flying faster than the speed of sound. The booms, however, dissipate rapidly over distance. Those produced at high altitudes rarely are heard on the ground, and supersonic flight above 30,000 feet, or almost 6 miles up, is unrestricted, <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said. Studies conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which was checking the potential for damage from space shuttles, indicate window breakage is about the worst damage that can be caused by an aircraft. Some people, however, give sonic booms credit for more. A man living just across the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> state line about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION> once complained that a sonic boom knocked his mobile home off its foundation. The man later admitted he had n't heard a sonic boom and was n't even home at the time. He later told <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> that he first thought it was caused by dynamiting at a quarry across the street until he saw a television news report about a boom causing broken windows at nearby cities. The most recent effort to limit boom complaints has been setting up special meters that register shock waves even if they are inaudible, <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON> said. `` Although arming the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is our mission, we will always have a responsibility to be good neighbors,'' he said. `` Minimizing sonic booms is one way to fulfill that responsibility.''

<HEAD>For Farmers, No More Accounting `Out of Shoebox'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers who recently overcame their aversion to computers, now must face another test: accounting. Yes, it's not enough to be computer literate to succeed in agribusiness these days. You'd better understand the numbers you're crunching as well Bankers are telling farmers that accounting `` out of a shoebox'' is no longer good enough to support a loan application. Instead, farmers must provide sophisticated data about their operations and show they understand the figures. `` It makes a banker skittish when someone ca n't answer what we consider basic questions,'' warns <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Sanwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` When I meet a customer who can talk intelligently with me regarding financial plans, how to control that, how to optimize returns and can present this type of information to us, it lends a lot of credibility to the management and general character of the operation.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Esterman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Fresno-Madera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, puts it more simply: `` Farmers have normally operated out of a shoebox, and we're trying to get them out of that mode.'' `` One question is obviously: ` Are you a good farmer?''' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, who along with the other bankers participated in a recent seminar on agricultural computing here. But he emphasized that it is not enough to be an expert about all the technical details of farming and have limited understanding of the farm's finances. `` The other aspect of being a good farm manager is being a financial manager as well _ understanding where those numbers come from and what they mean,'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. What technical data do bankers want before they will consider lending farmers money? <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, professor of farm management and accounting at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, offered this checklist: _ Current business and personal financial statements, including a full accounting of outstanding debts _ Three years' worth of tax returns _ A cash-flow budget _ Details of proposed programs for cropping and marketing, along with a three - to five-year history of crop _ Land locations, maps and lease arrangements _ A list of trade suppliers and credit agreements _ A complete equipment list, including descriptions, ages and serial numbers _ Partnership or corporate organization details _ Insurance coverage `` The day when a farmer can just be a farmer and let his banker be concerned about the financial aspects of his business is past,'' <PERSON> Esterman </PERSON> said. `` The farmer who can relay his financial message in a way we understand and he also understands, with help from a computer, is the type we are looking for _ not the kind who comes in with bills in his back pocket,'' he added <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said that when he began in banking a decade ago, `` I remember sitting down with customers at the kitchen table and helping customers prepare an application statement. We've gotten away from that.'' Lenders often are unwilling to start with the farmer's own raw financial figures, the bankers warned. They want information that has been spot-checked by a certified public accountant for accuracy or even audited as a more complete assurance of accuracy. That requires consistency and use of generally accepted accounting principles, which were not widely followed on the farm until about three or four years ago, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said computers can help provide the more sophisticated bookkeeping required on farms today. But <PERSON> Esterman </PERSON> cautioned that merely switching to computer bookkeeping will do little good `` if you are not in the habit of keeping good records, whether in a notebook or otherwise.''

 When you're looking up when other people are looking down you see things they ca n't possibly see, said the economist, observing that the adage had particular meaning in his profession. A lot of his colleagues are looking for bad news these days, he sasee a lot of bad omens. They see the falling jobless rate not as healthy but as a signal of inflation and higher interest rates to come. They observe that the factory utilization rate iid, and so they s rising, but rather than seeing this as good news for depressed areas, they view it as an indicator of stress on the economy, to be followed by inflation. But there are things to be seen by looking up, too, said the economist. You find, for instance, that the relatively low, 5.4 percent civilian jobless rate does n't necessarily mean the labor pool is exhausted and that wages therefore must rise. There are plenty of people unemployed, close to 6.8 million in fact. And, while some of these are unskilled teen-agers, many of them are adult men eager to work. He observed that the jobless rate today is higher for adult men than it was in May 1979, when the economy was in a similar expansion mode. Since ding on plant and equipment should rise 8 percent this year. We are in a capital spending boom, he said, explaining that it would mean expanded capacity, thus limiting the strain on existing capacity, and greater productivity, which would reduce inflation pressures. Well, said the listener to the upward-looking economist, you must concede that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is concerned, that interest rates have been edging higher. Of course, he said, and then he went into a long analysis of pessimism. People today, he observed, were conditioned for the worst by the 1970s, when the nation was harassed for years by double-digit interest and inflation rates. But why, he asked, do we assume that any movement in either rate must be for an extended period of time? Sure, he said, interest rates might rise and inflation stir, but that does n't mean they are long-term phenomenons. He pointed out that higher interest rates are designed to slow the economy. Why, he asked, do we think they wo n't do the job, that they wo n't slow the expansion? And if expansion slows, he continued, should n't rates then fall? There is one thing you must remember, he said. You should remember that the economy is always at risk, every day and in many ways. Danger is a given, as it is for all living things. But that, he concluded, does not mean that when the trend is down it is down for all time _ that when things turn bad they can not be corrected. The economy is cyclical, he said, and that means a downturn presages an upturn.

 In a money-is-no-object land rush, big egos and bigger bucks are tearing down grand but aging estates on the world's highest-priced real estate to make room for lavish super-shrines. The wealthy so-called Golden Triangle area _ <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> _ roars and rumbles and rings with the din of bulldozers and power saws. Some residents consider the new megamansions architectural obscenities. The enormous $ 12 million palace under construction for television mogul <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> is bigger than the White House and has been dubbed `` The Hilton'' by disgusted neighbors. `` Our peaceful neighborhood has been shattered,'' said one, <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON>. `` It's ostentatious and over-consumption,'' added another, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Irmas </PERSON>, who won a court injunction limiting construction hours and the number of trucks permitted at the site. `` The Spellings are very self-centered to come in and destroy a neighborhood like this.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Irmas </PERSON> called the mansion, which includes a bowling alley and an entire floor of closets, `` the mental institution, because you'd have to be crazy to build something like that.'' `` That's nothing,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the real estate firm <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` The biggest monument is going to be by the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> behind the Beverly Hills Hotel. He's torn down five houses for a palace.'' One was the estate of actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coburn </PERSON>, she said, adding: `` He -LRB- the sultan -RRB- paid full price, $ 5 million, and it's a teardown.'' Sentiment or nostalgia hold no sway in high-stakes real estate. Homes once owned by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and others have crumbled beneath bulldozer treads. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s estate was just part of the property Spelling leveled for his project. `` Everything is emotional. They want it, they buy it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` Nobody does a square footage cost on properties here anymore.'' <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, where property value within the 5.6-square-mile city limits is estimated at more than $ 5 billion, issued permits for 28 teardown projects in 1985, 43 in 1986 and 51 last year, said city spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. Fourteen have been granted so far this year. The trend is to buy a `` bargain basement'' house for $ 1 million or more, raze it and build a grand, gated kingdom. `` They are buying these charming homes and ripping them down and building these things,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Irmas </PERSON>. A new law allows a structure to occupy a maximum 55 percent of the property. `` Some of these were really out of scale in the neighborhood and we put in an emergency ordinance to stop it,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. Architect Cliff May, father of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch-style house, is a critic of the huge projects. `` Good architecture is something that fits in the neighborhood, but nowadays, many architects are building monuments to their clients and the homes look like castles and mausoleums,'' May said. Talk show host and producer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has also plowed money into real estate. A few years ago he spent $ 5 million, modest by <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> standards, on a four-acre stone mansion and completely refurbished it. Now he's carving out a homesite on 150 acres in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> near the Benedict Canyon homes of Ann-Margret and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. Earth-moving equipment is readying a 16-acre plateau for a Palladian villa. Author <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> bought a <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> teardown for his future mansion, to be called <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. The megamansion brouhaha is not confined to the Golden Triangle. On the exclusive <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON> peninsula overlooking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the 49-room Via <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> estate owned by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> has provoked interest in an ordinance to limit structure size. The home has been dubbed the `` Visalia Sheraton'' by angry neighbors. `` I enjoyed not looking at all this,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkley </PERSON>, who complains the house, with turrets, pillars and an ornate brick and stone wall is an eyesore. It lures unsavory `` looky-loos,'' she said. `` It puts us at risk.'' Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, refurbishing old mansions _ as opposed to tearing them down _ remains in vogue, particularly those with plenty of square footage to knock around in. Examples include The Knoll, a 35,000-square-foot estate remodeled by <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and sold for $ 22 million to oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Kirkeby </PERSON>, the old `` Beverly Hillbillies'' estate undergoing extensive remodeling by TV producer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Perenchio </PERSON>. `` He stole that place for $ 13.5 million. It was the best buy in town and will be worth $ 25 million when he's finished,'' Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Kirkeby </LOCATION>. In the shadow of the <PERSON> Kirkeby </PERSON> is the modest $ 2.5 million home where President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will likely spend their post-White House years. The value of the properly alone is estimated at almost $ 3 million. Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said investors from all over the country are showing up `` with suitcases full of money.'' `` They do n't even haggle over price,'' she said. `` You've got a lot of people who have made money and this is a place to dispose of it. Homes are much more important here than they are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and here people are much more into show. `` This is a definite show town. Everybody is trying to outdo their neighbor, from cars to houses to designers to everything.''

 Television producer <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON>, who created lavish prime-time fantasies Americans love, is building an opulent real estate fantasy his neighbors hate. In this real-life drama with soap-opera overtones, the 56,500-square-foot <LOCATION> Holmby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> mansion has already been immortalized in satirical song in `` An Ode to Spelling's Dwelling'' and is called `` The Mental Institution'' by a neighbor who says only a crazy person would build it. Spelling, whose TV shows include `` Dynasty,'' `` Hotel'' and `` Fantasy Island,'' is himself tight-lipped about the $ 12 million home mushrooming on the six-acre parcel he bought for $ 10 million, said his publicist, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>. The Spelling property was once anchored by the 10,000-square-foot <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> house and included two other homes, all torn down for the new mansion. The French chateau-style structure, which will house Spelling, wife Candy and two children, dwarfs other sizeable mansions in the area. It is longer than a football field and has a roofline 51 feet from the ground. Tons of natural limestone shipped from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will cover the exterior. Inside will be a bowling alley, a screening room, a gymnasium, garages for eight cars, a tennis court, an entire floor of closets tucked between the soaring first and second floors and, of course, a swimming pool. `` Aaron Spelling is not a superstar in this neighborhood, and I'm not excited about the visibility of this wealth,'' said one neighbor, <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON>. `` Yet, you have to look at this with a certain amount of humor. If you do n't laugh at it, you'll cry.'' Composer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ojai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he was staggered by published reports of Spelling's lavish home, so he knocked out a calypso-style rap song with these lyrics: `` See Candy's jewels, see <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>'s money, `` <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> does n't think being picked on is funny. `` See Candy's clothes, see <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>'s pad, `` See <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and Candy's castle, make the neighbors mad. `` But they're livin' in splendor high above the crowds, `` 60,000 square feet of heaven. `` That's Spelling's dwelling, I said Spelling's Dwelling ...''

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports $165 Million Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Farm Credit System has posted its third consecutive quarterly profit, a $ 165 million net in its first fiscal quarter that reversed its loss of $ 155 million a year earlier. The profit reported Tuesday was due entirely to a $ 160 million reduction in the reserve for loan losses and a $ 10 million net gain on other property owned. The system's net interest income of $ 146 million _ the difference between interest income and interest expense _ fell short of its other expenses of $ 151 million. A year earlier, the system had net interest income of $ 149 million, less than the $ 164 million in other expenses. The Farm Credit System has been able to reduce its loan-loss reserves because borrowers are considered better able to repay their loans. `` The improvement in the agricultural economy experienced in the latter half of 1987 continued into the first quarter of 1988,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, president and chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> announced the Farm Credit System's profit jointly with <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Beesley </PERSON>, president and chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The Farm Credit System consists of 37 borrower-owned banks and associations serving the rural economy. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put it on a more secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to $ 4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans. The 1987 legislation, by increasing confidence in the Farm Credit System, made it possible to narrow the interest-rate spreads on Farm Credit debt obligations over <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> said the first-quarter net interest income was boosted by special factors, and may be lower in the rest of 1988. The allowance for loan losses as of March 31 was $ 2.744 billion, down from $ 2.951 billion at the end of 1987 and $ 3.532 billion as of March 31, 1987.

 A broad move by five big brokers to limit computerized stock trading has won enthusiastic endorsement from critics who claim the strategy has caused unwarranted price convulsions and alienated many investors. But some question the effectiveness of the halt on index arbitrage program trading, because four of the firms will continug using the strategy for their clients' investments. <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced limitations on program trading for their own accounts only, while <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had imposed a total suspension. The moves marked the most aggressive voluntary steps yet to calm an outcry over the strategy, which has been blamed for destructive volatility in the stock market before and since the October crash. `` It is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that also reflected a view expressed by the other firms. `` Any action taken by member firms to tone volatility and increase investor confidence should be applauded,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which also has taken steps to limit program trading. `` I think it's meaningful and a step in the right direction.'' Wall Street sources said the firms have been under enormous pressure from stock exchanges, customers, lawmakers, and even their own salespeople, for coordinated action to control the computerized practice, which involves the massive purchase and sale of stock index futures and the underlying stocks on which they are based. Although their action wo n't mean an end to program trading, some traders said it should help limit the volatility because the brokerages had used the technique much more frequently than their customers did. `` We welcome their decision, of course,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCroix </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based securities firm that has urged tough restrictions on program trading. `` We think it's a right one for the capital markets in the long run, and will encourage individuals to come back to the market.'' Nevertheless, experts say proprietary program trading by these brokerages has accounted for only about 20 percent of the total volume of trades attributed to the strategy. Some critics said this leaves plenty of room for more uncertainty. `` Liquidity in our financial markets has dried up, and this may be the first sight of rain we've seen in a long time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the finance subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the suspensions `` However, with customers still in the index arbitrage business, the question remains if intra-day volatility will increase or decrease.'' Capital Guardian Trust Co.. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, a member of the presidential panel that investigated the stock crash, said the big brokers probably had determined that bad publicity over the technique did n't outweigh the profits they derived from it `` These guys decided that life's too short,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` I think they get the blame for all the volatility in the marketplace, but all the volatility is going to go on, because of their customers.'' Most index arbitrage program trading is done on behalf of institutional clients, such as pension funds and banks, who see the strategy as one of the few moneymakers in a market that has languished since the October crash. At the same time, program trading has frightened billions of investor dollars out of the market because it can swing prices violently without regard to a stock's real value. The result has been a severe drop in trading volume and stock underwritings. Some said the actions Tuesday reflected a growing belief in the securities industry that lawmakers would take steps aimed at restoring investor confidence unless brokerage firms could reform themselves. `` What's really developed is a tremendous fear by the Wall Street commmunity that legislators may take significant action that might be an over-reaction,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a futures expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had previously announced suspensions of index arbitrage program trading for their own accounts. But only <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'s was considered significant because the firm was among the biggest users of the technique.

 Program trading is a catch-all term for a range of computerized trading strategies that most often refers to index arbitrage, which involves the rapid purchase and sale of stocks and stock-index futures. In this strategy, traders attempt to profit on discrepancies between the price of the actual stocks traded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the value of indexes based on them, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500, traded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. When the stocks trade at a significant discount to the index futures, traders sell the futures and buy the stocks. Conversely, when the index futures sell at a big enough discount from the underlying stocks, traders sell the stocks and buy the index futures. The speed at which these transactions are executed is crucial to the program trading strategy because the price discrepancies between stocks and stock-index futures are temporary during the course of a trading session. Big brokerages use powerful computer programs that track these discrepancies and instantly set off buy or sell programs when conditions are deemed profitable.

 Forty-odd years of personal promotion failed to make <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>'s orange-peeling invention a success, but a few seconds of exposure on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes'' have sparked a deluge of orders for the gadget. Commentator <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s glowing comments and brief demonstration of the device in a show broadcast several weeks ago prompted an unprecedented wave of demand for the <ORGANIZATION> Quik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peel </ORGANIZATION>, which Blank has been selling in its current form for about eight years. `` This has been mind-boggling,'' <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> said in an interview from the couple's home in this west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town. `` We had no idea he was going to say anything about the orange peel. You ca n't believe the reaction.'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> demonstrated the peeler _ which had been lying in his desk for three years _ during a commentary on gadgets he gets in the mail. `` This is one of the best things I ever got,'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. `` It's changed my life. `` It really is magic. You can amaze your friends with this.'' In the past two weeks, <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Wil-Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have received dozens of mail and phone orders for the peeler, which he sells in groups of five for $ 6. `` Last week, we sent out about 500 or 600 orders,'' <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said. `` We're getting more every day.'' Blank nearly had given up on ever selling the public on his invention, which he developed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> while working as a welder before World War II. `` I was fresh off the farm, and I got out to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and found I loved oranges but hated to peel them,'' he said. `` That's when I came up with my orange peeler. The original model, made of stainless steel wire, looked more like a bottle opener than an orange peeler. Blank's patent application was rejected and for four decades tried unsuccessfully to market the device. He showed his peeler to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> at I.V. <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> about eight years ago, and <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> fashioned one from brightly-colored orange plastic. <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> has produced about 30,000 peelers since then, but says sales must soar before the product can be declared a commercial success. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> is n't sure why he still had the peeler in his desk drawer three years after <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> sent it to him. `` I just saw it in the drawer one day when I was looking for something, and I decided to give it a try,'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I really liked it.'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said viewers flooded the network with calls and letters after the `` 60 Minutes'' segment. `` We always get a lot of mail, but we got more than usual on this. Letters are still coming in,'' he said. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> speculated that the benefits of prime-time exposure would be fleeting, although a planned `` 60 Minutes'' follow-up filmed at the Blanks' home could help. Blank sold his blacksmith and welding shop two years ago, but still runs a mobile home park and other business interests. He is n't counting on the Quik Orange Peel to make him rich. `` I do n't want to be a millionaire. I'd have too many people on my back, then,'' he said. `` I'd be happy with about $ 90,000. I could live real comfortably in <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> on $ 90,000. Of course, if it goes above that, I'm not going to turn it down.''

But a <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> victory would indicate shareholder approval of the group's demand that <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> drop its `` poison pill'' takeover defense, a major impediment to the proposed acquisition. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 51.5 million common shares outstanding, is offering $ 42 cash a share for up to 39 million shares. The partnership proposes purchasing the remaining shares for $ 42 worth of debt securities and warrants, bringing the total indicated value of the deal to about $ 2.2 billion. USG has proposed to fight Desert Partners with a defensive recapitalization, which would be submitted to a shareholder vote on June 24. USG would borrow $ 2.2 billion to pay its shareholders $ 37 a share in cash, debentures with a face value of $ 5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their shares.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s shipbuilding orders have decreased by 41.3 percent so far this year from the same period in 1987 because of the national currency's appreciation in foreign exchange, officials said today. Orders received so far consist of 626,300 gross tons of export ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships, the officials said. But the officials also said that despite the sluggish orders, local shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6 million gross tons, enough to keep them busy until the first half of next year. The value of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> won has risen 7.43 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar so far this year. A higher won makes South Korean exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of imports.

<TEXT>
 An outside review of the deadly 1984 gas leak at a <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> plant was intended to objectively assesses the cause of the disaster, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says, although the resulting report provides little new information on the incident. The report released Tuesday by the firm <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> supported Carbide's claims that sabotage by a disgruntled employee caused the disaster. It also refuted as `` physically impossible'' the Indian government's contention that the disaster stemmed from negligence. `` We wanted the world to know that somebody that had a reputation that was worldwide and sterling ... would look at things critically,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>, a Carbide attorney. The report did not provide a motive for sabotage or name the worker believed responsible. But <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> said the company and the Indian government knew the worker's identity, and it eventually would be revealed in court. He said the worker wanted to punish a superior who had demoted him. <PERSON> Ashok </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalelkare </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, presented the findings Tuesday to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> symposium sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. An Indian government attorney involved in the case on declined comment on the report today, saying it would be `` improper while we're in litigation.'' He insisted on anonymity. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, Carbide closed up 75 cents a share to $ 23.87 -LCB- on Tuesday. At least 2,850 people were killed and 20,000 injured when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a holding tank at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> plant on Dec. 3, 1984. More than 500,000 people have filed claims in the case and the Indian government filed criminal charges against Carbide in December. The <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> report theorized that a worker entered the plant's storage area during a shift change the night of Dec. 2, 1984, and hooked a rubber hose to the methyl isocyanate tank with the intention of ruining the tank's contents. The chemical produces a deadly gas when mixed with water. `` The results of this investigation show, with virtual certainty, that the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> incident was caused by the entry of water to the tank through a hose that had been connected directly to the tank,'' the report stated. `` It is equally clear that those most directly involved attempted to obfuscate these events.'' The report was based on interviews with more than 70 former employees of the now-closed plant. Among those interviewed was an unidentified instrument supervisor who told investigators that the day after the disaster he discovered a gauge on the chemical tank had been replaced with a plug. Nearby, he also noticed a length of hose with water running from it, the report said. The report theorized that the gauge was removed, the hose inserted, and the hole filled with a plug once the water had been added to the tank. The Indian government contends that water got into the chemical tank when a worker failed to install a `` slip-blind,'' a device that prevents water from backing up, while cleaning a filter about 400 feet away. But <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>'s report asserted the theory was implausible for three reasons: the worker's hose pressure was n't high enough to raise the water to the level of the chemical tank; a safety valve to prevent such a mishap was found in good working order after the accident; and pipes that would have remained filled with water after such an occurrence were dry The report alleged that workers altered plant logs to hide that they tried to drain the tank after realizing water had been added. The consultant's report was highly critical of the Indian government, saying it stuck to the negligence theory despite evidence to the contrary and hindered <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to discover what actually happened. The company finally got access to key plant records and through them the names of plant employees when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate ordered <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to produce copies of the documents as part of the civil suit to which it was a party

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> plans to impose import duties on forklift trucks allegedly `` dumped'' below cost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Japanese manufacturers. In a unanimous ruling sought by <ORGANIZATION> Hyster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, the six-member commission said Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forklift industry had suffered `` material injury'' because of the Japanese practices. The ruling means the importers of forklift trucks will have to pay cash duties equal to the dumping margin on each Japanese forklift they import. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> will determine the dumping margins, with several expected to exceed 50 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruled last month that Japanese producers had been dumping their forklifts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The stock market started off sharply lower in active trading today, as share prices were hit by growing anxiety about the prospect of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 19.07 points at 1,984.58 at 10 a.m. EDT. The broader market also showed deep losses. Declining stocks surpassed advancers by 6-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 643 issues losing, only 151 gaining and 334 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in the first half-hour of trading was 38.68 million shares. The nervousness about higher interest rates was fueled today by comments by British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who made the comments in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas editions that was published today, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation.

 Bad loan portfolios in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have prompted the state's banking chief to increase projections on the number of 1988 bank failures from 50 to 70. `` Bank failures have not subsided during the first part of 1988 and, in fact, are running ahead of last year's pace,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Banking Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>. `` We have not seen a turnaround.'' Last year, 50 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks failed to set a national record. So far this year, 23 have failed. Another 179 state-chartered banks are on the regulators' problem list and <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON> said Tuesday that few will last until the state economy makes a rebound. He blamed troubled real estate loans for accelerating the closure rates. In addition, he said problem assets are squeezing net interest margins and forcing losses for the banks. But if the banks sell off those assets in a falling market, it could mean even more losses as the banks absorb the difference between the book and market values. `` A good number of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks are in an almost helpless situation,'' said <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>, who is encouraging federal aid for banks rather than closing the institutions. `` Through more aggressive use of open-bank assistance, much can be done -LRB- to help -RRB- the smaller banks.''

Separately, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent growth in the money supply. The statements sent stock prices tumbling in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> early today, as the key 225-share Nikkei Index fell 251.20 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at 27,161.05. Share prices also headed lower in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, before Wall Street opened for trading. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index was down 2.16 at 143.59.

<NOTE>Eds: updates with company announcement</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today said it has signed a contract to sell its steel plant in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Renco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Terms of the sale were not disclosed in the company's announcement Included in the sale is <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drainage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and its six plants, the company said. The Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said completion of the sale is targeted for June 30 and is subject to the approval of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization proceedings. In 1986, the Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> announced last November that it wanted to sell or find a business partner for its Warren plant, which is the largest steel mill remaining in the <LOCATION> Mahoning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The plant has about 2,200 employees. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> described the <ORGANIZATION> Renco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> as a privately held concern with 15 diversified manufacturing and distribution operations nationwide. All employees at the Warren plant and the Republic Drainage plants, including management, are expected to be retained, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s coke plant in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> is not included in the sale and will continue to be part of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said repairs to the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> blast furnace will be completed as scheduled later this summer. `` We believe this sale of the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Works </PERSON> and the drainage products plants is in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, the affected employees and local communities. We urge the employees, their unions and the communities of the <LOCATION> Mahoning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to extend their welcome and cooperation to <ORGANIZATION> Renco </ORGANIZATION> as it becomes a major employer and force in the local economy,'' <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said in a statement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he was informed of the sales this morning by <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> represents the <LOCATION> Mahoning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area. `` The good news is that they will retain all management and hourly workers,'' said <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>. `` The questionable news however is that the group has very limited activity in the steel industry. However, our local people have turned the plant around and made it profitable.'' <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said last fall that the sale would fit in with the company's plans to concentrate its operations and capital investment primarily in three flat-rolled facilities in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION>, Ill. The Warren plant has an annual raw steel production capacity of 1.5 million tons, the company said. It produces hot and cold rolled sheet and strip steel, hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel, silicon steel and terne plate. Republic Drainage buys half of the zinc-coated steel shiopped out of the Warren Works. Republic Drainage employs 150 people at plants in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Owego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION>, S.C.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 is withdrawing a suit seeking to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> from using federal money to move subcompact car production from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the local's bargaining chief said. `` We're going to drop that one,'' <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They -LRB- company negotiators -RRB- asked for that because of some of the economics they were compelled to give us. The lawsuit was a bargaining chip.'' The union lawsuit filed in February charged that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> were illegally using a federal grant to remodel <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plant for work it planned to move this July from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> since has announced it will build the subcompact cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> until the end of the year, when it will stop all auto assembly and stamping operations at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to increased pension and other monetary benefits for about 6,500 hourly workers and 8,000 retirees because it did not want to risk $ 50 million in federal money it would have lost had the union suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> been successful. The contract, which is to cover about 5,500 workers <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> intends to lay off or retire at the end of the year, and about 900 hourly workers it will retain in its engine division, gives workers severance and retirement options. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also has promised to keep the engine division at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> open for four years from Sept. 15, when the local contract becomes effective. The portion of the contract that governs those who will be laid off is a two-year agreement, <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said in outlining the pact Tuesday for union members who were to vote on it today. The contract proposal calls for return of $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 owed each worker under an employee investment plan used to help then financially-strapped <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said workers would get the money back over two years but would not get any interest or bonus payments That would amount to a total of about $ 58 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last year. <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also added $ 5 million to a $ 15 million job bank fund that will be used to pay full wages to eligible workers as long as the money lasts. The proposal also calls for payments of about $ 100 a week to each laid-off worker under the union's supplemental unemployment benefit fund.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bow-tied bunny still stands for sexy female centerfolds, lively interviews and men's fashion tips, but behind the flagship magazine a pragmatic new philosophy is emerging at <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gone are the company-owned key clubs and casinos, the luxurious <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mansion and the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bunny </ORGANIZATION> jetliner _ trappings that reflected and reinforced founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s hedonistic image In their place, <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, is building a leaner organization that, while more fiscally sound, is decidedly more staid _ right down to its recent acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coventry </ORGANIZATION> jewelry line. In six years as company president, the 35-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> has pared <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> to its core of publishing, licensing and video businesses. The proof of her pruning shows up on the bottom line: profits in the past seven quarters. She took charge of a company that was reeling from the loss of lucrative casino licenses in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, denial of permission to operate a casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, declining magazine sales and a faltering cable television channel. Under her leadership, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> has closed the last of its company-owned key clubs and disposed of its interests in movie theaters, modeling and book and record clubs. `` The entire management team headed by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> has repositioned the company to the point where profitability is now the norm and the potential for the future is probably brighter than at any time in the last several years,'' said investment banker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Having righted and steadied the ship, Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> is charting a course for Playboy that partially follows the successful example of an unlikely model: the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Just as <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> formed <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndication </ORGANIZATION> to make and distribute movies with uncharacteristically adult themes, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> hopes to expand by escaping its traditional `` In our case it's sort of the flip side of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We make products for adults and under the Playboy name they have a particular aura that is sexy and fun,'' she said. `` That's an aura that works for certain products but not for others If we want to be able to expand as a licensor or publisher or video-film creator, we'd like to be able to do that without the Playboy name as a restriction.'' So in addition to its array of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and Playmate brand videotapes, casual apparel, jewelry and accessories, the company plans to become a distributor of similar products that will not carry the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> name or bunny emblem _ and theoretically will have a broader appeal. `` It's the mass market, that middle market, that's of most interest to us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said. The first move in that direction was <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s quiet acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coventry </ORGANIZATION> in November through its neutrally named new subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unlimited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The new strategy does n't mean the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> trademark has outlived its usefulness. Playboy magazine, with an average paid circulation last year of more than 3.6 million, is still the company's strongest suit, though circulation may never again approach the 1972 zenith of 7.2 million The magazine survived a government crackdown on pornography and a ban by 7-Eleven stores in 1986, and contributed more than $ 98 million to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 revenues of $ 162 million. Sales of video products, including the revamped <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> and video centerfolds, added about $ 29 million, followed by $ 23 million from other publications and $ 10.5 million from licensing and merchandising. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> has had trouble holding subscribers, the company maintains high hopes for its video unit, which just released its first Playmate video in eight months thanks to a new distribution deal with <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 11 million profit in 1987 and strong performance in the first nine months of the current fiscal year followed a $ 62 million loss in 1986. Before turning profits in 1984 and'85, the company had notched a string of losses stretching back to the first quarter of fiscal 1982, the year Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> took over. `` In the early years after I took over we were of necessity mostly engaged in the business of closing down business, selling off businesses and solving old problems,'' she said. `` In the last few years I've been much more able to put my mark on the company and that's coincided with my father's desire to be much less involved in the operations of the company.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playboy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>, reduced his involvement in the company after suffering a stroke about three years ago. He retains the titles of chairman and chief executive officer, still approves every <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine cover and centerfold shot, and provides `` creative input'' on the home-video products. While she speaks admiringly of her father, whom she calls `` Hef,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said the company he built into one of the great business successes of the 1960s ran into trouble in the 1980s because it had n't kept pace with changing attitudes about leisure time. Some analysts also blame her father's preoccupations. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> -RRB- spent more time supervising the photo sessions for the centerfolds than he did reading the balance sheets of his company,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hef </PERSON>'s daughter, in contrast, is an active, thoroughly involved boss. Described by <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Radomski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokeswoman, as demanding and energetic, Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said she shares her father's enthusiasm for business but not his penchant for pajama-clad hobnobbing with the jet set `` What I like to do is have the chance to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> or lecture on a case study on my management style at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> or host a dinner party for high-level prospective investors,'' she said. An honors graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in English and American literature, Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 after working for a year as a journalist for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a weekly newspaper. Her parents divorced when she was 3 years old. Her mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, remarried and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> used her stepfather's name, <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, until 1973, when she renewed her relationship with her father and took back the <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> name. Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, who lives within walking distance of Playboy headquarters, said she splits her working time between company offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where her boyfriend, a television executive, resides. Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> calls herself `` a business person, first and foremost'' and a feminist. `` I realized many years ago that there would be some people out there who would never be satisfied with what I did,'' she said. `` My mission in life is not to change everybody in the world. My mission in life is to make the best of this extraordinary opportunity and believe, as I do, that the vast majority of people will judge me honestly and objectively.''

<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every morning for the past seven or eight years, a half-dozen men have met for coffee and cigarettes at the oval table in the rear of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>'s only restaurant, <ORGANIZATION> Poplar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The `` Roundtable,'' as the group of contractors and builders is sometimes called, has watched with skepticism as the sleepy Southern town prepares for its transformation into a regional automaking center. <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, population 1,100, is the home of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> plant, which is scheduled to begin producing cars in 1990. But whether the investment is paying adequate dividends for <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is a question that still sparks debate over morning coffee here. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> is located in a kind of never-never land, on 2,450 acres that are not taxed by any county, town or state government and that officially lie in no town. `` It is its own empire,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, a 68-year-old engineer who has lived in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for 40 years and is an acknowledged leader of the `` Roundtable.'' Brewer thinks <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is missing its chances to cash in on the growth <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> will bring to the area once its 3,000 employees begin work. He abhors Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' efforts to toughen development laws, which impose impact fees on new building and make it harder for developers to erect fast-food restaurants, convenience stores and the like. One regulation that particularly bothers <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> is a new ordinance that restricts the size of business signs to 2 feet by 2 feet. Everyone agrees they want to ensure their quality of life, but to <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, quality of life includes fast food and the fast development that has been experienced by other Southern boom towns. `` They're not doing anything to encourage people,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said of the town's stance toward developers. To the mayor, quality of life comes with controlled growth. For example, he views the erratic building that has occurred around <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> in the past 10 years as incompatible with <PERSON> Spring </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s goals If prepared, Spring Hill can avoid the overburdened roads and services that frustrate <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> residents, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced in 1985 that it would build a $ 5 billion plant in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as a joint venture with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The state, anxious to land the plant, promised to build a $ 50 million highway to the town and provide $ 20 million to train workers the plant would need. Almost all the Saturn employees will be <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members who were laid off in other states by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make payments in lieu of taxes to <LOCATION> Maury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which distributes money to neighboring towns. Land speculation cooled somewhat when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it would halve its planned production at the plant to 250,000 cars a year. In fact, more homes were built in 1980, before Saturn arrived, than in 1987. But for every fallow field in Spring Hill there is a realtor's sign advertising its availability, and even the skeptics admit the place is bound to change as the startup date for <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> nears. Within two years, the town will probably be unrecognizable. Developers have begun submitting plans to build tracts of homes for the newcomers. The largest proposal yet, by developer <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, proposes building about 3,100 multifamily homes and 1,000 single-family homes on 11,000 acres off the <LOCATION> Saturn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> over a 20-year period. <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> also plans to develop 195 acres for commercial use and 270 acres for industrial use, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who is working on the proposal for <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON>. `` It's advanced <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> probably 10 to 20 years already,'' Mayor <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s effect on the town. The town has advanced, in <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' view, by increasing its police force from two to seven full-time officers, by building a town hall to grow into and by updating its zoning regulations. The $ 1.2 million town hall, built with money from <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, moved out of its one-room trailer -LRB- which was also donated by Saturn -RRB- to a building on a 165-acre complex on a hill off Main Street. Called `` The Town Center at <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' the development eventually will feature restaurants, stores and multifamily homes. Despite such plans, contractor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is among those who believe <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is chasing away developers by requiring them to pay impact fees for services. `` The only thing I've ever built in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is my house and that'll probably be the only thing I ever build,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, believes landowners should be able to do as they please with their land. Farmers `` do n't want people telling them what to do,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Zoning regulations, such as the one governing sign size, discourage prosperity, he said. `` Everybody in the country wants to go to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to see those signs, but who in the hell wants to go to Spring Hill?'' Spring Hill resident <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, an engineer with <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, is one who views the slow lurch into the future gladly. `` In the long term, <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> will be a very attractive place to live because of the strict zoning laws. We're not faced with the tenement type projects,'' he said. `` We may have some lean years in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, but in the long run it's going to pay off.''

<HEAD>Saturn: Top Secret Import Weapon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Saturn-Spring Hill</HEAD>

 The manufacturing site for the Saturn car lies between the towns of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, obscured from view by a manmade rolling hillside bordered by a bright white picket fence. After Saturn arrived, both towns annexed land as close to the plant as possible, to take advantage of the housing and commercial development that will follow the completion of a new parkway to the plant. Despite their neighborly proximity, townspeople know little about what goes on inside the compound. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> officials say the town wanted them to place the plant out of view, while their neighbors occasionally grumble that they are being intentionally shut out. But Saturn is intended to be a mystery, a successful top-secret weapon against import cars. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which funds <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> as a subsidiary rather than a division of the company, expects the plant to turn a profit immediately, said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Saturn. Almost a fourth of the plant has been completed since construction began in June 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> plans to offer a family of <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> cars _ subcompact and compacts _ in 1990 for the 1991 model year, Ms. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. State legislators who visited the sprawling site in March viewed the half-completed powertrain building where car engines and transmissions will be built. Construction also has begun on three other buildings where cars will be assembled and painted before rolling off the line. Part of the plan to make <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> competitive with imports involves approaching production work differently, and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> officials _ along with their partners in the venture, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union _ are adopting management techniques developed by the Japanese, said Ms. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. Employees will be involved in all aspects of production, from understanding the cost of supplies to sales, she said. They will be on salaries rather than the traditional hourly wage rates, with 20 percent of their pay based on the performance of the company, Ms. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. Saturn jobs will first be offered to the estimated 300,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members who have been laid off around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. About 6,000 people have applied for the 3,000 jobs that are to be filled by mid-1989. The plant is designed to produce 250,000 cars a year initially. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plans to increase production, depending on the auto's reception by car buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> has begun reviewing about 1,700 applications for a network of dealerships, which are expected to reach 123 cities by the end of the first model year. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> has sent employees to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to study Japanese automaking procedures, as well as to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. `` We're looking very hard at everything. We're not inventing everything,'' she said. `` We are taking a fresh look at what we do.''

<HEAD>Soybeans Open Sharply Higher; Grains Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices opened sharply higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest supply-and-demand estimates. Grain futures were mixed. The soybean market's early gains of as much as 9 -LCB- cents a bushel were expected after the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> revised downward its estimate of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpile, predicting stocks would dwindle from 275 million bushels on this Aug. 31 to 145 million bushels a year later. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reduced its estimate for this year's Brazilian soybean harvest to 17.6 million metric tons from 18 million metric tons. `` This adds to the general feeling or perception that soybean stocks are shrinking very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report, issued Tuesday afternoon, was considered neutral for corn futures, which opened slightly higher, and was construed as somewhat bearish for wheat. The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest would be about 4 percent larger than last year's and that prediction weighed on wheat futures this morning, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 2 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.01 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with May at $ 1.99 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 1.62 a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents to 9 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.14 a bushel Cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .37 cent lower with June at 782.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .232 cent lower to .65 cent higher with May at 79.97 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent to .53 cent higher with June at 51.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .53 cent higher with May at 51.85 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

 The stock market was holding steady at sharply lower levels at around midday today, weakened by investors' anxiety about the prospect of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 39.96 points at 1,963.69 at noon EDT, close to its level of an hour earlier but widened from its initial losses. The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocks outstripped advancers by about 6-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,269 issues losing, only 182 gaining and 372 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was 103.35 million shares, up from 61.95 million traded by the same time on Tuesday. The anxiety about higher interest rates was fueled today by comments by British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who made the comments in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas editions that was published today, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent growth in the money supply. Some observers and market players expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise its key discount rate, the interest it charges big financial institutions, possibly this week. Market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were a big factor behind October's stock collapse, and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervous investors. `` The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in rates,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to ban index arbitrage trading, saying the computer-driven transactions are undermining public confidence in the stock market. `` I do n't think it's too extreme to say that overall confidence in our free market system is threatened by this sort of scandal,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` And that's what it is _ a scandal.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has been the focus of attention recently for a book he has written on his years as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Most attention has been drawn to his revelation that First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consulted an astrologer about the president's schedule. Before <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> spoke, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, read <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s horoscope to him, which said that he could not `` force colleagues to be more understanding'' until May 17 <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> did not respond, but said later that his testimony `` comes at an interesting time in terms of my own personal activities.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said that program trading is `` fundamentally changing and endangering the basis on which our economy and stock market have functioned for generations.'' He said that although individuals still own most stocks, institutions in recent years have dominated trading. `` If the public feels that the markets are rigged, not only in favor of the big guy, but also in favor of some unidentified computer-based trading strategy, then confidence in our markets, indeed in our system, will plummet,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> called on the nation's financial markets and the federal agencies that regulate them to impose their own restrictions on program trading. In index arbitrage, traders use computers to profit from price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other. At the same hearing, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, who heads his own discount brokerage firm, said program trading should be totally abolished. `` The individual investor in this country is angry,'' <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> said. `` Most of all, he is angry about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s failure to enact reforms needed to promote greater stability in the securities markets.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>'s comments came a day after five big Wall Street firms announced they have halted index arbitrage trading for their own accounts as a means of restoring investor confidence in the stock market. However, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee of the board of governors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, defended index arbitrage today at a breakfast meeting with reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He acknowledged that some individual investors believe program trading destabilizes the market, but he maintained that index arbitrage does just the opposite because it ensurse that stock and futures prices closely track each other. `` I'm not going to defend perception,'' he said. `` The reality is it is not a factor -LRB- in the volatility -RRB-. Index arbitrage was and is a stabilizing factor.'' `` I do n't believe there's many individual investors who understand the issue,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trades the most popular futures contract, which is based on the Standard and Poor's 500.

 F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, two bright spots in a mostly dismal first quarter for the retailing industry, on Wednesday reported robust increases in their earnings for the period. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> said its net income for the three months ended April 30 totaled $ 35 million, or 54 cents per share, up nearly 21 percent from $ 29 million, or 43 cents per share, in the first three months of fiscal 1987. Sales rose to $ 1.71 billion from $ 1.53 billion. The first quarter of the retail fiscal year was a disappointment for many storeowners as consumers continued to spend cautiously. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s sales dipped more than 5 percent in April, but the company fared better than most of the other big retailers in the first two months of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> saw no letdown in its business during the quarter. The rapidly-expanding discount chain reported earnings of $ 153.6 million, or 27 cents a share, up nearly 40 percent from $ 110.4 million, or 19 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1987. Sales totaled $ 4.28 billion, up from $ 3.21 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be a possible takeover target for <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently asked for federal permission to acquire up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has not yet made a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> operates <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> general merchandise stores and specialty retailers including <ORGANIZATION> Kinney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION>, Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> operates more than 1,200 discount stores in 24 states.

<HEAD>Small Companies Outperformed Big Business, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Companies with fewer than 100 workers increased employment at a faster rate than large businesses during the latter half of 1987, but the number of new small firms decreased sharply during the period, according to a study released Wednesday. Employment among small companies rose by 1.9 percent during the last six months of 1987, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent for larger businesses, a study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> showed. The partnership charts small business growth based on data from 7 million companies with fewer than 100 employees. During the latter half of 1987, new small business incorporations plunged 7.71 percent. Sales of small business goods and services increased by 1.06 percent during the period, compared with an increase of 0.13 percent for their larger counterparts. The rate is down, however, from the 1.27 percent increase in sales small businesses reported during the first half of 1987. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, who heads the small business partnership, noted that small businesses `` held up well during this uncertain economic period.'' He noted that the first half of 1987 was `` a period of uncharacteristically high levels of new business start-ups,'' and therefore any decline in the latter half `` should be considered in context.'' Small businesses in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> states posted the greatest growth, with employment up 2.26 percent and sales up 1.52 percent. Those in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> region had the highest gain in employment, which rose 2.31 percent, and a 1.25 percent increase in sales.

 Stock prices closed sharply lower Wednesday as players dumped shares amid fears of higher interest rates. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down 35.8 points, or 2 percent, at 1,756.8. Volume was a hefty 575.5 million shares, compared with Tuesday's 397.5 million Stock prices opened lower as the market bearishly interpreted a comment from Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that major industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in interest rates. The comment, published in European editions of the Wall Street Journal, pressured <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for most of the session. During the day, the newspaper issued a statement saying it had failed to fully report <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s remarks. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> boosted its prime lending rate a half percentage point to 9 percent, the first increase since just before the stock market crash in October. However, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkham </PERSON>, an equity analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We do n't think it's the beginning of a major lurch lower'' in stock prices Another dealer said the rampant takeover talk that had fueled the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market over the last month had run out of steam. `` The market had been spoiling for a sell-off for quite some time and when no takeover bids panned out,'' players liquidated their positions, he said. A lower finish in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier Wednesday added to the downward pressure, several analysts said. A few bargain hunters were spotted late in the day attempting to take advantage of the sharply lower prices, but the market failed to make a significant turnaround, dealers said. `` Prices did n't have the stomach to bounce back by the end of the day as they did Tuesday,'' one dealer said.

 Share prices dropped on Wall Street today, as anxiety about the prospect for higher interest rates was heightened by a rise in the prime lending rate by two major banks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 44.27 points at 1,959.38 at 2 p.m. EDT, widened from its losses earlier in the session. The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocks outstripped advancers by about 7-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,375 issues losing, only 200 gaining and 336 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was 138.82 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> boosted their prime rates by a half percentage point to 9 percent. They were the first increases in the prime since just before October's stock market collapse. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> was the first big bank to raise the key rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including mortgages. Chase's move was announced around noon today after Wall Street had already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears. `` It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, referring to the increase in the prime rate. Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend to dampen companies' expansion plans and investments. The hike in the prime came against a background of growing edginess about the outlook for interest rates. British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> indicated earlier today that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who made the comments in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas editions that was published today, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation.

<HEAD>Brazil Nearer Agreement With Banks Over Debt, Banker Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> delegation seeking to renegotiate debt repayments may be able to reach a preliminary agreement with a committee of international banks soon, the bank panel's chairman says. According to <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a bank official who is chairman of the 14-bank committee, said in a speech Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the committee had `` reached preliminary agreement on nearly all major items'' in the talks. He said he expected an overall agreement within `` a week or two,'' but added it could take longer. Under negotiation is a $ 62 billion debt-restructuring package _ the largest ever undertaken _ which would cover more than half of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 112 billion foreign debt. According to the text of his speech, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said that if a final agreement could be worked out, it `` would bring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> fully current on interest payments to commercial banks.'' `` For the past month,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` I have been estimating that we would complete our negotiations on a preliminary agreement within a week or so. We're breaking new ground in some areas, which makes predictions on timing difficult However, we are very close.'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said the negotiators were working on stretching out payments due on $ 62 million in debt over the next 20 years rather than the eight years called for under the original loans. The points agreed to so far, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said, include new loans totaling $ 5.2 billion to cover Brazilian external financing for 1987 through the first half of 1989. He said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s participation in the package will be significant and the most extensive since the package negotiated with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1986 and will include substantial co-financing of commercial bank loans. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> noted that `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has been the focal point of the debt crisis for the last year or so,'' beginning with its moratorium on interest payments to commercials banks declared in February 1987. He said that `` some economists estimate that the moratorium cost the country at least one to two billion dollars'' when the banks retaliated by cutting off short-term credits and taking other measures.

 Royal <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest oil concern, said Wednesday its net profit rose 18.4 percent in the first quarter from a year ago <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> said earnings from its marine, marketing and chemicals businesses improved but that exploration and production earnings were down due to the combination of lower crude oil prices, reduced natural gas sales and the strengthening of sterling against the dollar. It said its net profit increased to 822 million pounds in the first three months of 1987 from 694 million pounds in the same period a year ago. Using average rates of exchange over the respective quarters, that worked out to $ 1.48 billion, vs. $ 1.07 billion in the first three months of 1987. Special items affecting the latest quarterly earnings were a gain of 106 million pounds, or $ 200 million, from the sale of a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> property and estimated after-tax inventory losses of 78 million pounds, or $ 147 million. The year-earlier period included inventory gains of 92 million pounds, or $ 174 million dollars, Royal Dutch said. British companies' accounting method can not be directly compared to the method used by American companies, because of differences in determining the value of inventories. Using the American method, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> said, its net profit spurted 49.5 percent to 900 million pounds, or $ 1.7 billion, from 602 million pounds, or $ 1.14 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said sales fell 5.2 percent to 13.63 billion pounds, or $ 24.9 billion from 14.37 billion pounds. In dollars, that worked out to $ 24.9 billion in the latest quarter, when the pound was stronger than the dollar, vs. $ 22.13 billion, in the year-ago period, when it was weaker. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch arm, controls 60 percent of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the group's British arm, controls the remaining 40 `` The outlook for exploration and production earnings depends on whether the increases seen in crude oil prices since early March can be sustained, despite recurring volatility,'' <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.

 Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest supply and demand report. Grain futures retreated slightly. The surge in soybean prices was expected after the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, in a report issued Tuesday afternoon, predicted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpile would dwindle from 275 million bushels this Aug. 31 to 145 million bushels a year later. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reduced its estimate for this year's Brazilian soybean harvest from 18 million metric tons to 17.6 million metric tons. A smaller Brazilian harvest could increase world demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans. `` This just reaffirms the uptrend in the market and the bullish attitude of the trade in the soybean complex, particularly in the beans,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Bounced Back In April, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers' confidence rebounded in April, suggesting consumer spending will remain strong in coming months, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The business research organization said its index of consumer confidence rose to 114.6 in April from 112.7 in March, leaving it just below its level of 114.9 in February. The index peaked at 115.7 in September, the month before the stock market crash. That was its highest level in 15 years. The index, based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households, is considered an important indicator for the economy because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product. Consumers have been spending cautiously in recent months, and analysts have attributed their hesitance in part to concerns about the economy. The base year for the consumer confidence index was 1985, when it was at 100. Its margin of error is plus or minus 2 or 2.5 points, meaning the change from March to April is near the limit of the margin of error.

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary Says Swiss Must Play Fair on Takeovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said Wednesday the Swiss government must be prepared to allow British companies to make takeover bids in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> without legal restrictions if Swiss companies expect to be able to buy up British concerns. `` Swiss companies, for example, expect to make takeovers in our market. Their government must ensure British firms can make takeovers in theirs,'' said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> at an agricultural forum in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The foreign secretary made no direct mention of the 2.1 billion pound, or $ 3.97 billion, hostile takeover offer by the Swiss chocolate company <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> for York-based <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British confectioner. <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> confectioner, also has built up a 29.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>. The moves have been highly controversial in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because Swiss companies are protected from takeover by Swiss law. Swiss companies are eager to buy operations within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> is not a member, to better take advantage of the lack of barriers to takeovers. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to create a single barrier-free European market by 1992 would make takeovers more of a two-way process.

<HEAD>Sale of 37 Hospitals in 10 States Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will sell 37 hospitals in 10 states to an employee group in a transaction valued at $ 910 million, the company said Wednesday. The announcement follows sale of 15 hospitals and layoffs of 2,000 workers in the last 18 months in an attempt to boost earnings at the hospital company. It considerably exceeds Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>'s prediction after the company's annual meeting in January that between five and 20 hospitals would be sold in the next three years. American Medical said the acute-care hospitals, which among them have 4,200 beds, would be sold to a new company owned primarily by an employees' stock ownership plan to be established at the new company. The new company will be headed by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, present director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> region, and will have headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> will retain an interest through an issue of preferred stock in the new entity, which has not yet been named, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> is seeking bank loans to finance the planned $ 600 million cash portion of the sale, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The rest of the transaction would bring <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> $ 310 million in preferred stock in the new company, assumed debt and notes, the company said. The proceeds, estimated at $ 450 million after taxes and expenses, will be used to pay off debt and buy back stock. The company retains 48 hospitals and five psychiatric hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 22 hospitals and three psyciatric hospitals overseas. `` This sale will allow <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> to focus singularly on improving the earnings per share generated by our remaining asset base,'' <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said. The hospitals to be sold are in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Those hospitals had combined net revenue of $ 507 million in 1987. American Medical, which in March reported second-quarter profit fell 13.9 percent to $ 24.1 million, is under pressure from the holder of 5 percent of its stock to sell marginal operations. For the first half of its fiscal year, profit rose 11.8 percent, to $ 63.3 million, over the year earlier.

 Democrats stepped up their challenge Wednesday to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on trade, threatening an all-out fight until the November elections unless he drops his veto threat and signs a 1,000-page trade measure. `` Do n't turn your back on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future, Mr. President, do n't give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men and women a pink slip,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said at a congressional The signing and a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> rally held outside Democratic national headquarters were parts of a show of political muscle orchestrated by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as a sendoff for the bill before it goes to the president's desk. With 15 television cameras trained on him and scores of baffled tourists wandering through, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> signed the massive bill at a ceremony in ornate Statuary Hall near the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber. Supporters of the legislation applauded and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> passed out pens that were used in the ceremony. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tempore <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., was expected to sign the measure quickly and return it to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for delivery to the White House Democratic leaders indicated they planned to have it there by the end of the week. Wednesday's ceremonies clearly were aimed at casting the bill in a flattering light and thus make a veto sound all the more harsh. Democrats said the issue was bound to strike a resonant chord on the campaign trail. Party Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said voters would `` rally to the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. On hand for the rally were lawmakers, their aides, religious and labor leaders and a handful of laid-off workers brought in by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> for the occasion. Republicans were absent. At the bill's signing, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that drew up the bill, urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the measure There have been recurrent reports of friction between <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> over provisions of the bill that appeared to guarantee a veto. Notable among them has been a feature requiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-day notice of plant closings and major layoffs. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s office said he had not been invited to the rally. `` But our nose is n't out of joint about it and neither should yours be,'' press secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. He said the affair was `` being blown up.'' In explaining his veto plan, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has pinpointed the plant-closings provision as well as the bill's curbs on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reaffirmed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto the bill. The trade bill was one of the items discussed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a private meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Afterward, talking with reporters in the White House driveway, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., expressed confidence that the veto will be sustained House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>, said that after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto is upheld, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could move `` very quickly'' to enact a replacement bill, minus the provisions on Alaskan oil and plant-closing notification. The centerpiece of the bill are provisions that would overhaul the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> uses trade restrictions to aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries threatened by imports and retaliate against international trade violations. For example, authority to order retaliatory tariffs and quotas would be transferred from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. The bill has hundreds of other provisions, ranging from a potential $ 2 billion in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil company earnings. At the rally, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> described <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., as `` the architect'' of the legislation <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the support of Americans for the plant-closings feature were `` indicated in every poll.'' But he did not cite any specific poll results and a morning news conference at which pollsters were supposed to release results was canceled. The legislation passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 312-107, a margin more than enough to override the expected veto. But it won final passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on April 27 three votes short of the two-thirds needed for an override, and Democrats were still uncertain of just where they would find the additional support. `` We'll consult the stars,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said wryly The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been sitting on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> while the Democrats tried in vain to win over two votes for a veto override by reopening the measure and stripping out its restrictions on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports.

 Share prices dropped on Wall Street today, as several major banks raised their prime lending rates and confirmed investors' fears about higher interest rates. About a dozen big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks boosted their prime rates by a half percentage point to 9 percent _ the first increase in the prime since just before October's stock market collapse. Market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were a big factor behind the Oct. 19 crash, and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervous investors. `` The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in rates,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was the first big bank to raise the key rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including mortgages Chase's move was announced around noon today after Wall Street had already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears. `` It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, referring to the increase in the prime rate. The hike in the prime came against a background of growing edginess about the outlook for interest rates. British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> indicated earlier today that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who made the comments in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas editions that was published today, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent growth in the money supply. Some observers and market players expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise its key discount rate, the interest it charges big financial institutions, possibly this week. Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend to dampen companies' expansion plans and investments.

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is testing colored diapers _ blue for boys, pink for girls _ in several states to see if pastels catch on for baby's bottoms. The diapers, which bear the Luvs Deluxe brand name, also include extra padding in the front for boys' diapers and in the middle for the girls' version. The padding is part of a patented system aimed at better absorption, <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The padding is just placed a little differently,'' she said. The diapers are being made available in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, as part of a market test, Ms. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. P & amp; G will see how well they're accepted before deciding whether to market them across the country. `` It's too soon to know whether or not these diapers will be available nationally,'' she said. `` Consumers ultimately will be the ones to judge.'' Parents' comments prompted P & amp; G to offer the colored diapers, Ms. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said, adding that it's the first time the company has attempted such an experment. `` Parents are the ones who told us that they liked that. It was a fashion decision,'' she said. Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> has been locked in a tight competition with <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> for the lead in disposable diaper sales.

Good sales by the Luvs brand helped P & amp; G maintain the overall lead. P & amp; G recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with aggressive marketing and product changes. P & amp; G lost a legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> last year when a jury in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ruled that the elasticized waistband in Huggies disposables was not a patent infringement.

 The first spike in bank-lending rates since the October stock market crash jolted Wall Street on Wednesday, heralding a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars. Several big banks, pressured by increased costs of borrowing money themselves, raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, nearly erasing the results of three rate decreases over the past seven months. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> led the move and was followed by competitors. The prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interest rates elsewhere. But the rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses, as well as determining many types of consumer loans, including increasingly popular home-equity loans. Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because it aroused memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the stock crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 37.80 points to a three-month low of 1,965.85. The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, when it went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate retreated to 9 percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stock collapse. It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and to 8.5 percent Feb. 2. The prime-rate increase partly reflected moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, to nudge interest rates higher in order to forestall sharp increases in inflation that many analysts fear might accompany recent surprisingly strong economic growth. The clearest evidence of that growth came last week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said unemployment had hit a 14-year low. This suggested worker shortages will rise, pushing up wages and intensifying demands for goods and services that increase the cost of living and doing business, many economists said. `` Interest rates are going up now basically because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> dragged and dragged its feet and finally was presented with incontrovertible evidence that the economy was doing well, perhaps too well,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` So the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could n't just sit by and do nothing. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based forcasting firm, said the prime rate increase would have a broader effect now than in years past because it is no longer just a benchmark rate for new loans to a bank's best corporate customers. `` What does it mean for consumers? Once upon a time, the impact would have been limited,'' she said. `` But now, because of the increased use of home-equity loans and other adjustable rates, even people who have current debt outstanding, they feel the effects. Their financing costs rise. It squeezes their discretionary spending in general.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has two fundamental choices in trying to balance economic growth and inflation: It can control the amount of money in the banking system and can adjust its key lending fee to financial institutions, known as the discount rate. That rate has stood at 6 percent since Sept. 4. Economists said it was clear the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had recently tightened the amount of money in the banking system. But some doubted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would act quickly to raise the discount rate, which would be considered a much stronger sign of tightening. `` My guess is the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will not try to push interest rates up beyond current levels,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major investment research and credit-rating concern. `` There will be concern about the impact on the economy, especially in housing and auto sales,'' he said. `` Secondly, the inflation fears are a little bit overdone.'' Some economists said the low unemployment rates did not necessarily mean impending inflation. They argued that despite record numbers of people working, wages generally have not been rising. Others said it was clear that higher prices are looming, partly because of the increased cost of oil, grain and other commodities, as well as the impact of a lower dollar, which makes imports more expensive. Nevertheless, many economists agreed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would remain extremely reluctant to push up interest rates sharply and risk a recession, especially in an election year. They also said the central bank had learned from the double-digit inflation experience of the late 1970s that a little tightening now eliminates the need for more severe action later. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> understands if you let this process get out of hand, then you have a very hard time stopping it and you need incredibly high interest rates,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` It wants to tap the brakes a little bit rather than slam them on in a great fury.''

 The dollar got a boost from rising interest rates and closed higher against most major currencies in domestic trading Wednesday after dipping overseas. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 448.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 449.60 late Tuesday. The dollar began its climb shortly after noon, when the first of a number of major banks announced they would hike their prime lending rates to 9 percent from 8.5 percent. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the increase had been expected. Still, traders had to buy dollars to cover their positions. The dollar also was supported by indications that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit. `` The dollar can not go a lot lower in this environment of higher interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Trading was relatively dull and volume was light. The foreign exchange market appeared little affected by a report that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said major industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in interest rates. The comment, published in overseas editions of the Wall Street Journal, sent the stock markets into a tailspin, although the newspaper issued a statement saying it had failed to fully report <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s remarks. `` People were looking at -LRB- the comments -RRB- but did n't know what he meant,'' <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. Traders could interpret the comments several ways. `` If the stock market really came off, that could mean a flight to quality by investors, and that's bullish for the dollar,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` But it's bearish for the dollar if interest rates rise'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Trading was quite in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as many banks wound down their operations ahead of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday, which is observed by several countries. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 124.24 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a lower rate of 124.23 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar finished at 124.475 yen, up from 124.38 yen on Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8870 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.8825 late Tuesday. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> one pound cost $ 1.8815, cheaper than Tuesday's $ 1.88425. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.68275 West German marks, up from 1.67795; 1.3995 Swiss francs, up from 1.39435; 5.70375 French francs, up from 5.6905; 1,251.50 Italian lire, up from 1,247.35, and 1.2314 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2380. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.6773 West German marks, down from 1.6783; 1.3935 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955; 5.6912 French francs, up from 5.6905; 1.8830 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8815; 1,249.50 Italian lire, up from 1,248.00; and 1.2315 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2375 Gold prices rose overseas. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold rose to a late bid price of $ 449.30 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 446.50 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 449.50 compared with $ 446.50 late Tuesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.73 to close at a bid $ 451.68. But on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold closed at $ 449.70 a troy ounce, down from $ 450.10. Silver finished higher at $ 6.552 a troy ounce on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, compared with $ 6.45 on Tuesday In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.55 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $ 6.45.

 Much of the GI generation that fought in World War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is retiring in relative comfort, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> researcher reports. More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at least three sources, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. But elderly affluence is n't spread evenly across the nation, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> reports in the June edition of American Demographics magazine. `` There are a cluster of states with a large share of the comfortably retired,'' <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> said in analyzing 1980 Census data, the most recent information available with sufficient detail for the study. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> had many of the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong showings in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> found. The poverty level for a family of four was $ 8,414 in 1980. The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators for their <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> benefits and federal laws protecting private pensions, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> noted. In addition, many were able to invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI generation after the term `` Government Issue,'' which became a popular for soldiers in the 1940s. Just over half -LRB- 51.1 percent -RRB- of those in the 65-74 age group were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the elite elite.'' For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7 percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other retirement benefits. The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5 percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets and most completed a large share of their working lives before World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in such resort and retirement states as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> executives have retired, and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has a large <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population where extended families are more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure used as the basis for this calculation, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> noted. For the pension elite, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> placed well, as did <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> also noted that there are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas. He cited as examples <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and along the east coast of <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, and his work was partially funded by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> American Demographics, published by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reports on population matters Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the pension elite. Comfortably retired -LRB- CR -RRB- is defined as having income of twice the poverty level. Pension elite -LRB- PE -RRB- means receiving from three sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

<HEAD>CFTC Approves New Stock Index Futures Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a new stock index futures contract for the first time since the October stock market crash. The commission voted unanimously to permit the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> to trade contracts based on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 250 Stock Index and the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> 50 Stock Index. The action came only a day after five big Wall Street firms announced that customer concerns about stock market volatility had prompted them to stop for their own accounts a form of futures trading known as index arbitrage. In index arbitrage, pension funds, mutual funds and other institutional investors use computers to profit from momentary price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which governs the stock market, has blamed index arbitrage for accelerating the Oct. 19 stock crash and for the continuing vulnerability of the market to wild price swings. Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday stock index trading should be suspended. However, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, defended futures index trading as `` important and beneficial ... -LRB- to -RRB- our economic and financial system.'' Commission member <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the contracts Wednesday `` will illustrate that, while the events of last October raise important policy issues, we are not prepared to let competing market factions use government regulatory authority to provide special status and competitive position to any faction, to the detriment of the broader public interest.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> 50 and <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> 250 are weighted indexes based on the largest 50 and largest 250 stocks traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A rival to the CBOT, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, trades futures contracts based on the largest 100 and largest 500 stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. Stock index futures allow an investor to buy a group of stocks and to hedge the risk by purchasing offsetting futures contracts. `` The improvement in risk management afforded by the trading of stock index contracts rebounds to the interest of millions of small investors who rely on institutions to manage their savings,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said in a statement. She said the fears of some individual investors have made futures trading `` a perceptual issue.'' But, she said, `` The way to address it is through education of the public ... not by blocking innovative products that can improve market efficiency.''

<HEAD>Gulf &amp; Western Announces New Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major entertainment, publishing and financial services company, announced another stock buyback program Wednesday, its third in five years. The company said its board authorized the purchase of up to 10 million shares of its common stock in the open market. The plan, designed to bolster the value of the shares that will remain on the market, follows the completion of a 24 million-share buyback adopted in 1985. The latest repurchase plan included 5.2 million shares snapped up in the wake of last October's stock market crash, when scores of companies bought back their own shares to help stave off further price declines. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the buybacks had enhanced shareholder value `` by giving each shareholder increased ownership of the company.'' Since the initial buyback was launched in 1983, about 44 million shares have been repurchased at an average price of slightly over $ 21 a share, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western said it had about 118 million shares of common stock outstanding after adjustment for a 2-for-1 stock split on May 2. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western shares traded strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the announcement, but were dragged down 37 -LCB- cents to $ 37 by the market's broad decline. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 38 points to 1,965.85. The company's stock is up significantly from its 52-week low of $ 29.75 a share, and analysts credit management for keeping a high priority on shareholder interests. The buyback announcement follows the company's failed attempt to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a children's book publisher and commercial printer. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said the company's cash flow was strong enough to accomplish both the buyback and the acquisition. `` It has strong momentum in its entertainment business, stability in financial services and a mass of cash,'' said <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western's publishing holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, which publishes books for mass circulation, and Prentice-Hall, an educational and professional publisher. Its entertainment segment includes <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices dropped sharply Wednesday in edgy trading, weakened by fears of higher interest rates that pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to a three-month low. The key index of 30 premier stocks slid 37.80 points to 1,965.85, its lowest closing level since it closed at 1,961.54 on Feb. 11. Most of the slippage occurred early in the session. Losing issues outstripped gainers by about 7-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,363 issues declining, 238 advancing and 367 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 176.72 million shares, up from 131.2 million Tuesday. Wall Street's fear of higher interest rates were aggravated by an announcement from big banks that they had raised their key prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the first rise since the October crash. Hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were a big factor behind the crash _ and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervous investors. In addition, higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend to dampen companies' expansion plans and investments. `` The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in rates,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was the first big bank to raise the key rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including some types of mortgages `` It clearly hit a raw nerve ... this market was clearly vulnerable,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, vice president and director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The hike in the prime came against a background of growing edginess about the outlook for interest rates. British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> reportedly suggested that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who was quoted in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas edition Wednesday, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 42, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> lost -RCB- at 38 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 26 ~, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> dropped 2 -LRB- to 108 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> declined -RRB- to 50 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 1 \ to 52 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> fell | to 22 ~ and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> eased -LCB- Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 204.86 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index fell 2.27 to 143.48. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials declined 5.34 to 294.32, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.31 at 253.31.

<HEAD>Technicals, Supply Concerns Boost Pork Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on a combination of technical factors and indications that a seasonal downturn in hog supplies had begun, analysts said. On other markets, cattle futures were mostly higher; stock-index futures fell sharply and precious-metals futures dipped as the prime lending rate rose; soybeans posted strong gains while grains were lower; and energy futures advanced. The rally in pork futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was powered mainly by technical buying based on traders' analyses of price charts, market analysts said. For example, heavy buying occurred and selling interest evaporated each time the contract for June delivery of hogs moved above Tuesday's high price of 51.97 cents a pound, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. On the fundamental side, some traders believed the annual drop in hog supplies had begun, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. More pigs are born in the fall than at any other time of year, and most of those animals have been sold for slaughter by late spring, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> `` Since Monday, the hog flow has dried up considerably and some people feel this is the start of the seasonal move,'' he said. The drop in supplies means higher prices but `` we can also expect an increase in volatility,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. `` The size of today's advance is already giving us a prelude to that.'' Cattle futures advanced in line with higher cash prices but traders were cautious about establishing new positions ahead of Monday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .62 cent higher with the contract for delivery in June at 73.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 80 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent to 1.38 cent higher with June at 52.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.75 cents higher with May at 53.07 cents a pound. Stock-index futures plunged along with stock prices as big banks raised their prime lending rates from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. It was the first increase in the closely watched rate since the October stock market crash. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> registered early losses in reaction to a sharp drop in worldwide stock prices caused by interest rate fears, analysts said. The second jolt came at midday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks began announcing higher prime lending rates. `` The market did not react well to the increase in interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index settled 5.20 points lower at 253.40. The precious-metals markets also registered disappointment at the rise in interest rates but they absorbed the news in a matter of hours, then began moving higher and finished nearly unchanged. `` The markets were aware that beyond the negatives of a higher prime rate is the feeling that it fuels inflation, and that's bullish for the precious metals,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold settled 40 cents lower across the board with June at $ 451.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2 cents lower with May at $ 6.552 a troy ounce. Soybean futures prices soared as much as 9 -LCB- cents a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest supply and demand report. Grain futures retreated slightly. The surge in soybean prices was expected after the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, in a report Tuesday afternoon, predicted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpile would dwindle from 275 million bushels this Aug. 31 to 145 million bushels a year later. The report was seen as neutral for corn futures, which finished modestly lower in Wednesday's session. The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest would be about 4 percent larger than last year's and that prediction weighed on wheat futures Wednesday, analysts said. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 3.03 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with May at $ 1.97 a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with May at 1.58 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.12 a bushel Energy futures prices were mostly higher in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Unleaded gasoline made the greatest gains because of a report showing heavy drawdowns of supplies over the past week, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 cents higher with June at $ 17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent lower to .44 cent higher with June at 47.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .63 cent higher with June at 52.25 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>World Markets React To Lawson Comments</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs with Journal statement; picks up 6th graf,
``The remarks ...</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s comments that there could be an internationally coordinated boost in interest rates sent a rush of worry through world securities markets Wednesday. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who made the comments in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas editions, noted that a coordinated effort by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other leading nations to hike interest rates `` is certainly possible'' following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in short-term rates to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation The Journal later issued a statement saying it had not fully reported <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s comments. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent growth in the money supply. In reports published Wednesday in overseas editions of the Wall Street Journal, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> noted, `` We did have very close coordination in the immediate aftermath'' of October's stock market collapse. The Journal said later in a statement it had failed to fully report <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s remarks. `` In an interview, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was asked if there is a possibility that governments may act in a coordinated way to raise rates in the near future, as they have done to lower rates in the past. He replied in part, ` That is certainly possible ...', `` the statement said. `` However, the article failed to note that in response to a follow-up question about the chances of coordinated interest rate rises in the near future, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> would only state, ` What I am saying is that we do keep very closely in touch with each other. I would n't go further than that' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the Journal report sent stock prices tumbling. The key 225-share Nikkei Index fell 251.20 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at 27,161.05. `` The remarks by <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> came at a bad time, with the market already worried about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refunding,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, referring to the quarterly sale of $ 26 billion in notes and bonds. The three-day sale ends Thursday. Share prices also headed lower in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Prices on many bond markets also moved lower in response to the comments by both <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, sending interest rates higher. Traders said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treasuries, British, West German and Japanese government issues all fell after the reports circulated. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the bellwether 30-year issue eased slightly in the early going. Bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates. Several central banks refused to comment on the <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> remarks. Any action by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to increase interest rates would affect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have resisted boosting their interest rates ahead of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate hike for fear of weakening the dollar. In his interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> also dismissed market concern that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would resume a hands-off approach to the dollar after the upcoming presidential election and allow the dollar to fall again. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> predicted the group of seven major industrialized nations would maintain their commitment to stabilize the dollar. Currency traders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dismissed <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s comments, and the dollar continued to move in narrow, directionless activity.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Ad Campaign Aimed at Updating Union Image</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said a new $ 13 million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that unions, like their workers, are interested in fairness, justice and life outside the job. The ads, which all end with a chorus singing `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> works best when we say union yes,'' have begun appearing on the television networks and in 13 local markets. The 30-second spots are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all American homes at least four times. Radio spots will be aired as well, including one that urges listeners to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected veto of the trade legislation. Unions have been pushing a provision of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large companies. At a closed-circuit TV news conference to the 13 cities where the TV ads will be shown, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said `` the labor movement has a long, well-documented record of fighting for the rights and the standard of living of working Americans. But in spite of that, there are still many Americans who have serious misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they are necessary in today's work place.'' `` The goal of ` Union Yes,''' he said, `` is to talk directly with American workers about the value of unions in the work place today. One of the best ways to do that now is through television.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the ads `` fill a need to let the population at large know what the trade union movement stands for.'' He said many Americans have `` a stereotype of unions and union members. They see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a $ 500 suit.'' One commercial focuses on women, with a woman saying unions have ensured fairness in promotions. Another, obviously pregnant, woman says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to have her baby and come back to a job. The first phase of the ad campaign runs through mid-June. The second phase picks up on Labor Day in September. The campaign, which is paid for with union dues, is expected to last two years. The ads will star actors <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesseman </PERSON>. Local TV ads will run during May and June in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.
