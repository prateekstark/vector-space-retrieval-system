 Radio talk show hosts proved they're a force to be reckoned with during the congressional pay-raise brouhaha, deluging <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with millions of tea bags from angry listeners. But they still feel ignored. So they're meeting in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> this weekend to do what other aggrieved minorities do: unite to demand more power. `` In the words of <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>, ` We do n't get no respect,''' said organizer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WRKO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The national media ... never took us very seriously. They think there's some conspiracy here.'' About 50 of the country's 225 radio talk show hosts began arriving Friday for the inaugural <ORGANIZATION> TalkRadio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a two-day gab confab expected to include consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, TV talk show host <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and political columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a 65-year-old talk jockey who's been in the business since 1950, said he hoped the gathering would give visibility to a national movement that has given ordinary people a chance to be heard. `` There's a huge void where people feel they do n't have a voice anymore,'' he said. The voices at the conference are deep and smooth. The smiles are big. The words are vehement and well-rehearsed. `` There is no more representative government in this country anymore. It's all special interests,'' said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON> of WTKK-AM in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The reason politicians are afraid of talk radio is we have the ability to allow private citizens to talk to their government.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> took the first step toward unifying the talk show hosts in February, when he was able to persuade his colleagues to lead a national protest against proposed federal pay increases. Coaxed by their local hosts, listeners sent their congressmen a ton of tea bags bearing the message: `` Read my tea bag: no 50 percent raise.'' The public pressure helped halt a raise for lawmakers, judges and other people on the federal payroll. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he was encouraged by the cooperation of his on-air brethren to try to formalize their connections through a conference. The session got going Friday with an open mike to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area listeners. Today, the talk show hosts planned to talk to each other, exchanging ideas and formally organizing, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Faneuil Hall, the venerable brick building where revolutionaries fomented independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abolitionists railed against slavery, served as the stage for Friday's events. In the morning, <ORGANIZATION> WRKO </ORGANIZATION> host <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> leaned into one of the microphones and said, `` The people are sovereign, not the government,'' adding: `` Our elected representatives try ... to give Americans enough fat from the hog to keep people from rising up.'' His peers from across the country and about 125 listeners from around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> took their seats. And in person, the talk show fans were as vociferous as their radio friends. `` I like to hear what the people say and not the politicians. We have a governor here who's a dictator,'' said <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Czapski </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, his face turning red. `` You've got me going,'' the retired tool and die plant manager said happily. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Wofsey </PERSON>, 36, of <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, who works for a department store, said she's a frequent listener and talker. `` It's the satisfaction of voicing my opinion, to express it over the airwaves. With letter writing, there's no response,'' she said. `` You can get a response from the talk show.''

 A woman described as the godmother of a gang of drug-smuggling ritual killers says she is innocent of any wrongdoing, including 15 slayings at a ranch near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, also said Friday she expects to be indicted on murder charges. She scoffed at the claim by investigators that she was the `` madrina,'' or godmother, of the gang. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the Eastern Penitentiary. They have been held there since the May 6 shootout with police in which cult leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and his associate, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, were killed. <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and gang member <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> were arraigned in the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> slayings earlier this week in the 9th Federal Criminal Court in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and were awaiting other indictments. They were indicted last month on various charges in connection with <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s death in a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment and pleaded innocent. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> also said they were innocent of the Matarmoros killings and when they were captured May 6 they were fleeing, against their will, with <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>. `` He threatened me,'' said <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said the man who forced her to accompany him was a different man from the charming fortune-teller she'd met a year and a half earlier. `` I thought I knew him, but I did n't,'' she said. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> made her go with him when he fled <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because he feared she would go to police, she added. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> hit her and threatened her with a submachine gun. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> after authorities began digging up mutilated bodies April 9 at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> ranch. Among the victims was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student. Authorities said <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> and several other victims were sacrificed in rituals to provide magical protection for the gang's drug-trafficking business Seven people in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, including two fugitives, were charged last month in the slayings. Both <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said they knew nothing of the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> killings until they saw news reports. <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said he had never been to the ranch, and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said she was there only once for a birthday party. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a former honor student at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southernmost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, said she spends her time in solitary confinement reading. `` If I knew I did something, I could say I was paying for it, but I did n't,'' she said. <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said he tries not to think about what will happen to him. `` The future is very black,'' he said. `` Something completely different from what I wanted.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gunman who surrendered to park rangers after releasing eight hostages from a visitors' center will undergo a psychiatric examination, authorities said The man, identified as <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was taken into custody Friday night and transported to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, where he will be tested. `` He is a frustrated guy who has had a hard life,'' said park ranger <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, noting that <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> once suffered from cancer. `` He was relatively calm the whole time.'' The hostage-taking `` was an expression of asking for help. Some people have a hard time asking for help,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Park spokesman <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, 18, walked into the center at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s Old Faithful geyser complex shortly after 3 p.m. Friday, brandished a Ruger .30 - caliber revolver and told everyone inside to lie Women and children who were visiting were released a few minutes later, but <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> held eight hostages about three hours, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The hostages included five male visitors and three park employees, two of whom were women. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Painter </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, one of the hostages held for three hours, said the center was silent inside except for the sound of <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> talking on the telephone with park rangers. `` I was just lying there on the floor watching him,'' Painter said. `` I was scared. I did n't know what was going to happen. He did n't say a word -LRB- to us -RRB-. He never said anything about why. He was real calm.'' Suddenly, at 6 p.m., <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> yelled an obscenity into the telephone and told everyone to leave, <PERSON> Painter </PERSON> said. The hostages ran out the door. No one was injured and no shots were fired, park authorities said. Park ranger <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he conducted the telephone negotiations for nearly five hours with <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, who had a gun trained on the hostages throughout much of the period. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> told him he planned the incident, and that `` it was a choice between the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> put the gun down about 8 p.m. and walked outside the center, where he was met by three park rangers in a car. After a short conversation, he was handcuffed and placed in the car, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> are scheduled to visit <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to inspect damage from last summer's forest fires The center is not in an area the president planned to visit.

<TEXT>
 A woman struggling to keep her $ 1.7 million gift business alive says the state's enforcement of a law banning sewing work at home is unfair and has cost nearly 100 women their jobs. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <ORGANIZATION> Overly-Raker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to stop using 100 or more homeworkers to piece together `` soft sculptures'' _ geese, cows, cats and other creations stuffed in cloth skins. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Overly </PERSON>, the company's president, said she was unaware of the 1937 Industrial Homework Act and made no effort to hide the company's use of women sewing at home. The law prohibits anyone other than handicapped or those providing primary care for a handicapped family member from doing industrial work at home. Overly, a former teacher, founded the company in her basement 16 years ago with <PERSON> Freda </PERSON> <PERSON> Raker </PERSON>, a former secretary who handles the business' creative end. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> ordered the company to stop home production May 11 in response to a complaint, Overly said she began to hire the 30 or more seamstresses needed at a plant in a former dairy distribution building in southern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s rural <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` The biggest hassle now is to find people who will come in,'' she said. Most of the women who had worked at home will lose their jobs because they have small children or can not get to the plant, she said. `` There's a lot of hardship going on because of this.'' One worker, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, said the $ 250 a month she earned supplemented her husband's income. She said she worked for almost two years, usually earning about $ 4 an hour based on the piece rate paid by Overly-Raker. `` It was very important. It takes what my husband makes to meet the expenses,'' she said. `` My money would take care of clothes, the dentist, medicines.'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said she ca n't leave her 11-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Colletta </PERSON>, and 12-year-old son, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, to drive the more than 100 miles between her home in rural <LOCATION> Armstrong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to the new Overly-Raker plant. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the state was determined to enforce labor laws. `` We work to protect people's rights,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, an international vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said homework provides an opportunity for companies to exploit workers. `` There is no control. There is no such thing as overtime. Their children help them. Before you know it, children under 12 have become helpers,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` It becomes substandard conditions.'' During a recent interview, Overly said the company had more than 400 orders for more than 8,000 pieces of merchandise as it prepares for the Halloween to Christmas holiday season. She had hired only five full-time seamstresses and was worried about higher labor costs when the threat from low-cost imports from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is growing. Still, she said the company would survive.

<HEAD>U.S. Jews Being Asked to Finance Freedom of Their Soviet Brethren</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews have set aside a special matzo each Passover and prayed for the emigration of their brethren in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now that those prayers have been answered for many, Jews in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are being asked to set aside something more than unleavened bread _ the money required to resettle as many as 50,000 Jews who are expected to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year. The United Jewish Appeal, the national fund-raising campaign for Jewish causes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has launched Passage to Freedom, an effort aimed at raising $ 75 million for Soviet emigres this year. Half will go to resettlement activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rest will be split between Soviet Jews in transit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and those seeking to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have worked for years and years to free them from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Now that they are free, we ca n't deny them the freedom to choose where they are going to live,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Reider </PERSON>, director of public affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We really do n't know how long these doors will be open,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lender </PERSON>, who is leading the national effort. `` We're looking at the third largest Jewish community in the world, and here's an opportunity to save them.'' The campaign, launched in April, already has raised more than $ 21 million. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tishman </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, said one reason for the success is that many American Jews feel they did too little to save European Jews from <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` The idea of not losing another Jewish soul is all-pervasive,'' she said. Programs to help Soviet Jews have been taxed to the breaking point by the flood of emigres, especially in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the destination for more than half of the new arrivals. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for New Americans, the biggest private resettlement agency that gets about two-thirds of its money from the <ORGANIZATION> UJA </ORGANIZATION>, has had to spread its staff among three offices to make room for more caseworkers. The association is operating as many as 70 English classes a day for immigrants. It also helps new arrivals find jobs and housing. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s UJA-Federation has taken a $ 100,000 advance from its Passage to Freedom money to finance scholarships to Jewish day camps so youngsters can adjust to life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while their parents learn English, get jobs and find places to live. Appeal money in other cities also will go to programs with proven track records. `` In four to five months, we can make them tax-paying members of the community,'' said <PERSON> Reider </PERSON>. About 18,000 Soviets, mostly Jewish, left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the first five months of this year and another 26,000 applicants are waiting to be interviewed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. With only about 10 percent of the Soviet Jewish emigres choosing to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, some Zionists complain that too much money is going to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resettlement programs. `` Given the choice, I'd rather see much more of the Passage to Freedom money go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Soviet Jewry. Still, she said she has given to the appeal. `` I feel that we need very much to help them when they are here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report: Hong Kong Preparing to Offer Asylum to Chinese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is preparing to offer asylum to political refugees from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guardian newspaper reported today. Quoting the British colony's secretary for security, the paper said trained personnel and screening procedures have already been set up at the border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> province, `` even though it is recognized that this move will add to the growing tensions between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' The secretary, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s governor, Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, for talks with the British government `` In the volatile situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, nobody can rule out that a mass of refugees will attempt to cross the thin wire fence that now divides <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from the New Territories,'' the report said. The colony consists of an island and a mainland area called the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> adjoining the south of <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> province. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Chinese and diplomatic sources say police have begun arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the protests and participants in the resistance to military intervention. The Guardian said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> stressed that so far there had been no requests for asylum among the daily handful of Chinese who cross the border illegally. It said that in the past, illegal immigrants were sent back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> within 24 hours. `` But now, in the light of events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, political asylum will be granted and, unlike the Vietnamese boat people, whose presence is causing increasing friction in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Chinese refugees are certain to be welcomed,'' the report said. The military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has hurt the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> economy by raising anxieties over the period after July 1997, when <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is to hand the colony back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the terms of an agreement signed in 1984. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s upheaval already has dealt a serious blow to the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stock exchange and badly shaken confidence in the property market. Officials in the colony said today they fear a drop in its annual $ 4.3 billion tourism business as travelers cancel visits because of the upheaval. About 5.6 million people visited <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last year and 28 percent of them coupled the trip with a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Many people now canceling tours to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also are dropping <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> blamed leftist guerrillas for the assassination of his closest adviser and said they were `` trying to provoke a reaction'' from his right-wing government. All major political groups condemned the submachine-gun killings of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON>, 73, and two bodyguards Friday outside the minister's home. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a White House statement calling the assassination a `` vicious murder,'' and some Salvadoran politicans warned it could lead to new political polarization in the nation. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON>, a Cabinet member considered <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON>'s chief of staff, was the highest ranking official killed in the 9-year-old civil war between the U.S.-backed government and the rebels. The rebels as of early today had not claimed responsibility for the shootings. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, a Social Democrat and political ally of the rebels, said the slaying was `` an assasination in cold blood ... that does not contribute in any way to peaceful coexistence and dialogue.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> called <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> `` one of the most illustrious men of our country'' and told a news conference his adminstration will not not allow more `` provocations that push our country farther down into the whirlpool of violence.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said his government is convinced the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is `` trying to provoke a reaction from us, but we are not going to react outside of the law.'' Gunmen fired on <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON>'s car after he left his home in the capital. He died shortly after he was taken at <ORGANIZATION> Zaldivar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a nurse said on condition of anonymity. Police said the two bodyguards, one of whom was driving the car, died at the scene. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevallier </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, warned the assassinations could mark a new political polarization in the country. He said the attack was the result of `` the declarations of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> that if the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> does not accept its peace proposal there could be a military response.'' The rebel front last week offered to halt attacks if the new right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> government eliminated death squads. The alliance, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, denies any involvement with death squads and spurned the proposal. Arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army Maj. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who has been linked to the squads that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980's. He denies the accusations. Also among the founders was <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was a vice minister in the 1940's, a member of the civilian-military junta in 1961 and foreign minister in 1978. Guerrillas have pledged to make the country ungovernable under the administration of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who won a presidential election in March. About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since civil war broke out in 1980.

 Protesters rallied against the proposed forced repatriation of Indochinese refugees from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, likening the move to the Voyage of the Damned in 1939. They demonstrated outside the British Consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Friday as officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> urged that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> send home most Vietnamese boat people. Demonstrators harkened back to the voyage of a German ship loaded with fleeing Jews who were refused entrance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 900 Jewish passengers aboard the SS <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> returned to various European ports and many later died at Nazi hands. The event was depicted in the 1975 movie `` Voyage of the Damned'' starring <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>. A spokesman at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s British Consulate said officials had no comment. But the colony's British secretary of security, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, told reporters at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> news conference that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> `` has had enough.'' The refugee problem is creating a second crisis for the British colony deeply worried about coming under Chinese rule in 1997, he said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has 42,766 Vietnamese boat people, one-third of whom arrived this year. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said all but 14,150 were simply seeking a better way of life, rather than political refuge. The protesters _ including Jewish representatives, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and former Vietnamese boat people _ carried signs that read, `` Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>. Do n't Let Them Butcher Us'' or that quoted <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>: `` When people are free to choose, they choose to be free.'' Dr. <PERSON> Toan </PERSON> <PERSON> Truong </PERSON>, who escaped from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> just two days before the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in April 1975, told some 50 rally participants that forced repatriation was `` something that will be perpetrated by bloodless bureaucrats.'' `` This is a crime against humanity,'' said <PERSON> Truong </PERSON>, who was among two dozen protesters who began a five-day fast to call attention to their cause. Besides the British colony, protesters said countries that may be considering repatriation include <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malayasia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Demonstrators called on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to oppose repatriation and the screening of Southeast Asian immigrants. The issues will be discussed at the two-day <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Indochinese Refugees in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> beginning Tuesday.

 Federal prosecutors want to guarantee they have a claim against the assets of former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> even after he's dead. To that end, they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, on Friday. The critically ill, 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his 59-year-old wife are already under a criminal racketeering indictment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, charged with siphoning millions of dollars from their homeland's treasury The latest lawsuit, filed under the civil aspects of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, closely parallels allegations in the 90-count criminal indictment. `` The civil complaint was filed in order to ensure that the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as the interests of the victims of the racketeering enterprise will be fully preserved in the event of the death of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said the victims include the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people and numerous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. The criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and attending forfeiture claims against his alleged ill-gotten gains would be dismissed after his death, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> explained. `` Conversely, a civil complaint filed by the government against an individual defendant continues against the estate of a deceased defendant,'' he said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he would fight the civil case as well as the criminal charges. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, said: `` The lawsuit will be defended against vigorously, as is the underlying charge which essentially contains the same allegations.'' The Marcoses have lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since they were toppled in a popular uprising in February 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the federal charges. Her husband's ill health kept him from making the trip from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment. In April he was separated from the case, although the charges were not dropped. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who suffers from heart and lung ailments, has been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since Jan. 16. He underwent emergency surgery for kidney failure last month. His doctors and lawyers say he is near death. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury indicted the Marcoses and eight others last October on various charges. Racketeering charges against the Marcoses accused them of looting more than $ 103 million from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to buy art and real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The indictment also said the Marcoses defrauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and lending institutions of more than $ 165 million in buying and financing the choice <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate.

 <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> says it will cut the electricity it provides to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if its Central American's neighbor does not pay a $ 4.2 million bill due since 1987. <PERSON> Reginaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Panting </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference on Friday that `` our position is not to pressure the Panamanian government nor the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We are only trying to get pending bills paid ... and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has a bill with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> it has to pay,'' Panting said. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> provides <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with about 10 percent of its electrical service. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has the largest electrical processing plant in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and also sells electricity to neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Panting said he traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two months ago `` to remind the government of its debt with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` At the time, we warned that we could suspend the energy at the end of the month if <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> does n't immediately proceed to pay the debt, but it has n't done it.'' He said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had discussed the possibility of repaying the debt with sugar exports to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> but has not done so. `` Faced with what has happened, we are left with one other option: cut the electricity we send to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' Panting said. He said he will travel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> again next week in a last attempt to resolve the problem. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is considered <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader. He was indicted by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries in 1988 on drug trafficking charges, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has placed economic sanctions on the nation in effort to force him to step down.

 Americans and Chinese across the country rallied, rang bells and held candlelight vigils to keep the flame of pro-democracy sentiment burning despite the brutal crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want people to think that because it is quiet over there, all is over,'' <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON>, a Chinese-American research scientist with <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, told about 1,500 people at a downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> rally Friday. `` By adding our voices, the students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will know people are behind them.'' Church bells rang throughout <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after a moment of silence, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, more than 5,000 people attended a memorial service followed by a mock funeral procession for the victims of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> massacre. Marchers carried a figure inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, similar to one displayed by the student protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> until it was destroyed last weekend. `` This has united the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people for one cause _ to overthrow the government and establish democracy,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, one of the student organizers of the memorial service. `` We must never allow them to crush another body.'' Later, more than 15,000 people packed Dag Hammarskjold Plaza across from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, many wearing white headbands bearing the word `` freedom.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> drew cheers when he said, `` All these students wanted was a chance to speak with their own government about democracy.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also promised to rename the corner outside the Chinese Consulate as Tiananmen Square. Under a cold drizzle late Friday, about 100 Chinese students gathered by candlelight on the steps of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s City Hall to lay a wreath in honor of their fallen comrades back home. `` I wish there was more we could do, but at this moment we just do n't know what to do,'' said <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a 28-year-old graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're all very deeply, deeply sad and shocked.'' Earlier, a rally by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> students in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> was joined by <PERSON> Kui </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, a graduate student and granddaughter of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, whose death on April 15 ignited the pro-democracy movement. Students facing final examinations took time out on other campuses to remember their slain peers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Hispanic students helped Asian-Americans organize an afternoon march, and friends circulated petitions on behalf of <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonning </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, graduate mathematics exchange student who is missing after returning home with donations for pro-democracy protestors. Chinese students at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> held a memorial service, and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, students opened a multimedia exhibit tracking the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, about 150 Chinese and American students sang <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s `` Imagine'' and other peace anthems at a mournful noon gathering.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> made concessions in his tour of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pilgrim in the lands of Luther failed to excite a public already indifferent to its own church. From the fjords of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, to barren windswept <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> to the high-tech affluence of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s tour was unlike any of his previous trips to Christian countries, even those like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> are a minority. Faced with some reluctance to the visit by <PERSON> Lutheran </PERSON> clergy, the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics agreed to sit in silence in a Lutheran cathedral in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, referred to himself often as the `` bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'' rather than as <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and listened to chiding by Lutheran bishops. Even to his own flock, in a region with marked differences on sexual morality with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s teaching, he used more cautious language than usual when dealing with family issues. For a man used to drawing vast numbers of people, the crowds were tiny. In his final Mass today of the 10-day tour, in the Swedish city of <LOCATION> Vadstena </LOCATION>, about 2,500 youths attended. Roman Catholics represent less than 1 percent of the population of the five countries he visited. `` I saw the pope in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -LRB- in 1987 -RRB-. I was very surprised there were so few people here,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemmons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Trondheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. She plans to marry a Norwegian. There were no protests, although a fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> demonstrator rushed toward <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> during an outdoor Mass Friday. Security stopped the man, who was unarmed, 30 feet from the pope. Police said he wanted to hand the pontiff a leaflet. The trip is scheduled to end today. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials assured that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was highly pleased with his trip and said it helped move along Catholic-Lutheran relations. `` I do n't go to attract the masses, but to preach the gospel,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said midway through the trip. `` I go to bring the gospel everywhere there are Catholics. But I also go to those who are not Catholics, especially here where there are Christians.'' The pope appeared to go out of his way to avoid offending. In a region where birth control is encouraged and abortion rates are high, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> used such codewords as `` respect for the gift of life in all its forms,'' rather than resort to explicit language. His frequent reference to himself as `` bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'' was a sign of `` sensitivity for the people present,'' explained Australian Archbishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> undersecretary of state. Other terms, such as supreme pontiff, would be `` quite alien,'' <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> are overwhelmingly Lutheran although surveys have shown less than 10 percent regularly attend church on Sundays. One of the principal purposes of the trip was to further relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, dominant since the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION> swept away Catholicism four centuries ago. Some Lutheran bishops opposed the visit, and in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> they insisted that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> not participate in a prayer service in a Lutheran cathedral. The pope attended, sitting near the altar and following the service in a prayerbook without speaking. Afterward, in an exchange of speeches, <PERSON> Lutheran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Ole </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertelsen </PERSON> made no secret of differences between Catholics and Lutherans and told the pope `` nice words and smiling friendly church leader attitudes are not really what we need right now.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, however, viewed the ecumenical meetings as a success and emphasized it is better to air differing points of view than to pretend all are in agreement. `` After four hundred years of separation, time is needed for the process of reconciliation and healing to take place,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Friday in an ecumenical prayer service in <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION>. `` Not everything can be done at once, but we must do what we can today with hope for what may be possible tomorrow.''

 The yellow brick road leads to <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> this weekend, as four of the original munchkins join fans of `` The Wizard of Oz.'' Many believe the author who inspired the film classic, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, patterned part of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s travels to Oz after local sites and people because he had a summer cottage in this town. `` It really reminds me of the set,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON>, 65, who played one of the `` Sleepyheads'' who welcomed <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> to Oz. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> apparently was modeled after a neighbor, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martindale </PERSON>, who wore her hair in pigtails and had a small dog, said festival organizer J.L. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>. The Emerald Castle is said to be drawn from nearby Castle Park and a circle of houses called <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> was the model for <LOCATION> Munchkinland </LOCATION>, she said. This year _ the 50th anniversary of the MGM classic _ will be especially busy, said <PERSON> Meinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>, who played the coroner who pronounced the Wicked Witch of the East dead after she was crushed by <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s house. Former munchkins <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duccini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubin </PERSON> also appear at the festival, which runs through Sunday in this southwestern community near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FBI Affidavit Alleges Illegal Waste Burning at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead to water supplies for four <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburbs and illegally burned hazardous wastes at the site, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant, and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates it, covered up the contamination by stating that the plant was in compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the affidavit alleged. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schauer </PERSON> unsealed the affidavit Friday after a newspaper challenged withholding of the information that led <PERSON> Schauer </PERSON> to issue a search warrant for a raid on the plant Tuesday by federal agents. The plant, which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons, is 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The 116-page affidavit indicates the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into possible criminal violations of hazardous waste laws will focus on activities going back to November 1980. The affidavit also questions the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to award an $ 8.6 million bonus to <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> for excellent management of Rocky Flats. The Rocky Mountain News reported in Friday's editions that the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> also has launched an investigation of performance bonuses awarded Rocky Flats' managers. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> probe was the third blow sustained by the facility this week. On Tuesday, 75 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> agents raided Rocky Flats in a move dubbed `` Operation Desert Glow,'' as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inquiry. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> announced it had found 25 environmental violations at the plant. `` We need to check out every allegation that is in this document,'' Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said of the affidavit. `` If it -LRB- the plant -RRB- ca n't meet criteria for health and safety, we close it down.'' The affidavit revealed that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> aerial infrared surveillance of the plant in December found that an incinerator in a plutonium reprocessing building that was closed for safety violations was being illegally operated. The DOE closed the building in October after an outside warning sign was accidently covered up, and three DOE inspectors walked in without protective garb. The building reopened in January. The affidavit also alleged that since 1986, Rocky Flats has generated `` at least 35 to 40 hazardous or mixed wastes sent for final disposal to various on-site facilities'' that do not have permits or interim status under the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. `` The knowing treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous or mixed wastes without a permit ... is an <ORGANIZATION> RCRA </ORGANIZATION> felony,'' the affidavit said. The illegal discharge of pollutants into <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> occurred Nov. 15 and 16, the affidavit alleged, adding that the discharges and subsequent efforts to conceal them violated the Clean Water Act. <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> drains into the reservoir for <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, a city of 27,600 residents 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also detected liquid discharges into <LOCATION> Woman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which flows into the lake supplying water to the cities of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northglenn </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, just north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which have a combined population of about 157,000. Testing of the creeks `` strongly suggests that the contamination is medical waste originating from a research laboratory or a pharmacy'' at Rocky Flats, the affidavit said. The affidavit went on to say that there was probable cause to believe <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and DOE officials in November 1985 falsely certified that Rocky Flats was in compliance with all applicable groundwater monitoring requirements under the <ORGANIZATION> RCRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, various <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and DOE officials were aware of serious contamination and were informed that the monitoring system was deficient and did not comply with the <ORGANIZATION> RCRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the affidavit said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said agency officials had not had time to study the affidavit and had no comment. She also said she was unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation. In a news release, the department said a special DOE investigation team has been at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> since June 6, but has not found `` any condition or situation which presents an imminent danger to the public's health or safety.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, declined to comment Friday. He said <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> attorneys were reviewing the affidavit.

 An American military attache will interview a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> monk who has reportedly said he saw American prisoners in the re-education camp where he was held in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. The monk's daughter quoted her father as saying he shared a cell with three American prisoners for the last six years he spent in captivity. She said her father did not remember their names but described them as young and healthy. The monk, <PERSON> Iwanobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, 65, reportedly suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment. He has been hospitalized since January when he returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after being released from 14 years of imprisonment in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In the past week he has given his first interviews to the Japanese media, raising interest with claims he saw Americans held since the Vietnam War. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> denies holding American prisoners, and recently it has cooperated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials searching for remains of Americans missing in action. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that her father communicated with the Americans in his cell through gestures. `` My father told me that when he asked them if they were Americans, they nodded,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> said during a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> on Hokkaido, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island. She said the prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other. Her report differed from one earlier in the week on the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> was quoted as saying he saw `` five or six'' American POWs but never spoke with them and had been held apart from them. The location of the re-education camp has not been disclosed. Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reporter must have misunderstood because her father told her several times he had been held with the Americans. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attache will travel to <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> on Sunday to interview <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, speaking anonymously. He said Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> met with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attache at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> recently to report on her father's remarks and that the information was forwarded to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis. Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> initially refused to speak with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, saying her father was too ill, according to the embassy spokesman. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment, said <PERSON> Hidenori </PERSON> <PERSON> Hareyama </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Shiraishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokushukai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Hokkaido where <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> is being treated. Only <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s daughter can understand what he says and his speech is at times incoherent, <PERSON> Hareyama </PERSON> said. He refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk, told the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that Vietnamese political prisoners also called the foreigners in the camp Americans. Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> said her father does not remember the names of the three held in his cell but said they were still `` young and healthy.'' <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> told her he saw more American POWs, perhaps more than 10, before he suffered a stroke three years ago. `` My father is still afraid somebody will come and get him to throw him back in the Vietnamese prison,'' she said. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, formerly a city councilman in <LOCATION> Mibari </LOCATION> on Hokkaido, became a monk in 1966 and emigrated to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he set up a temple in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, now called <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was granted South Vietnamese citizenship in 1973, then was arrested in 1975 after the takeover of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by communist forces. On Jan. 20, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> released <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> for humanitarian reasons after appeals by international human rights groups including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 1,730 Americans are listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and 634 are missing in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. The <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war ended in 1975 with communist victories over U.S.-supported governments in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>.

 Syrian gunners shelled the coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, killing four people and wounding six, as an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> envoy tried to halt 12 weeks of bloodshed between Syrian and Christian forces. A police spokesman said about 200 shells and rockets fired from Syrian batteries in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> exploded around the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos early in the day. He said the fatalities were `` civilians killed near <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> when a 107mm <LOCATION> Katyusha </LOCATION> rocket hit a residential district near the harbor.'' The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people killed and 1,427 wounded since the current round of violence broke out March 8 between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units and an alliance of Syrian-Druse forces. The escalation coincided with the arrival in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Lakhdar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ibrahimi </LOCATION>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> secretary general, in a renewed effort to stabilize a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Ibrahimi </LOCATION>, an Algerian, crossed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line for talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the general's bunker office under the bomb-ravaged presidential palace of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of the capital. Ibrahimi drove to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> capital, Friday and held separate meetings with <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in the nation's dual government, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. The Arab envoy was dispatched to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by the leaders of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to seek compliance with a cease-fire called May 26. The committee of three Arab League heads of state was formed to find a solution to the 14-year civil war within six months. The three leaders also sent their foreign ministers on a tour of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the five permanent member states of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to promote a proposed settlement for the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis. The ministers _ Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Faisal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Filali </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bouallam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bsayeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> _ held a second, six-hour meeting Friday with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Details of the discussions were not officially disclosed. The three foreign ministers today arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, where they were greeted by foreign minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Al-Filali </PERSON> told reporters: `` We are sure we will find complete cooperation from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials in trying to find a solution to the Lebanese crisis.'' Before leaving <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the Algerian foreign minister said, `` We tried in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to define the major subjects that could be achieved in the forseeable future.'' He said that `` the solution is, in the end, in the hands of the Lebanese, and we were able to see <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' willingness to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily paper An-Nahar said the three were soliciting support for a seven-point settlement proposal. The plan, according to the paper, calls for `` exerting international pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' It also proposes the `` deployment of an Algerian force'' along a 75-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast to prevent the import and export of illegal material at the various ports. The coastal strip referred to in the plan extends from just above the southern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, through <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, to the northern city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The scenario also calls for `` lifting all sea, land and air blockades, reopening blocked roads between the sectors, including the Beirut-Damascus highway'' that runs across sections of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> controlled by warring <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Druse militias, the paper said. It said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> military observers would be deployed at the crossings and along the Beirut-Damascus highway. The plan also calls for `` convening a session of the Lebanese parliament to consider a draft for political reforms and the election by parliament of a president who would pledge to implement the reforms.'' The last point in the plan calls for `` discussing the question of Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> controls a 6-to-10-mile deep strip of Lebanese territory along their border. It serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

 Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s resounding defeat in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s freest postwar elections may have been only a passing phenomenon. At the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, a small group of Polish emigres protested Gen. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s visit, with one banner declaring: `` From <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to Peking, communism brings death.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today after a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and he met for 25 minutes with Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said the election results were `` a reflection not only of the attitudes but also of the emotions of the Polish people.'' `` But as you know, emotions are sometimes ephemeral,'' he said in an interview in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated. Following a stop to lay a wreath at Polish war graves in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader was to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for lunch at her country estate, <LOCATION> Chequers </LOCATION>. He plans to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sunday. Members of Solidarity with Solidarity, a British-based group, organized their weekend vigil outside the embassy near a separate weeklong vigil outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not saying that what happened in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was as bad as the Chinese massacres,'' said protest organizer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudewicz </PERSON>, referring to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army's attacks on pro-democracy protesters a week ago. `` But in 1981, it was Gen. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> who brought out the tanks onto the streets of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, when several hundred people were killed during martial law.'' Solidarity was crushed at that time and later banned. It was legalized under an April pact with the government. In a statement released Friday, Solidarity with Solidarity described <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> as `` a man decisively rejected by his nation'' in Sunday's elections. In the Polish voting for the new 100-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Solidarity won 92 seats and the other eight were undecided. Independent candidates were allowed to run for only 161 seats in the existing 460-seat Sejm, or lower house, but they won 160 of them. Only two of 35 top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders and their allies running on a special list of unopposed candidates gained a majority of `` yes'' votes, allowing them to take seats without a new election. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said in a British newspaper interview this week that he would stand by the results and suggested that his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could lose power in totally free elections in 1993. In the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said the elections were not a `` football match ... it is a political process.'' He referred ruefully to his imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981 and his banning of the free trade union Solidarity. `` Sometimes it takes a long time before the revolution becomes civilized,'' said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` We could not avoid it either.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after she visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last November and met with both government and Solidarity leaders. British officials said the prime minister was interested in talking with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> about the elections and his plans for the future. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s visit is part of widening contacts between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Western government leaders, who have welcomed the Polish reforms. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next week and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is due to go there July 9-11.

 Hundreds of radical students today battled police with firebombs, rocks and clubs after protesters demanded the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government let them take part in a youth festival in communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Police reported more than 1,000 arrests. About 2,000 students fought riot police at two campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after they were blocked from marching into the streets to denounce President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thirty student leaders were seized trying to reach the North Korean border for talks with communist officials, police said. About 1,500 students fought police with iron pipes, clubs and rocks at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and about 500 students threw firebombs and rocks at police at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Police hurled rocks back at students but did not use tear gas. `` Crush the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo regime!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' students yelled. Hundreds of students later battled police in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, hurling rocks and bricks. Riot squads used tear gas to break up the protesters and chased the students through the streets. Shoppers and pedestrians fled for cover. Troops and students were injured in the fighting, but the police had no figures on casualties. More than 1,000 students were arrested in the clashes or as they tried to reach the universities to take part in a second day of protests, police said. Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 20,000 riot police were deployed in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to block the university demonstrations. About 6,000 troopers in green combat fatigues and visored helmets ringed <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION>, outnumbering the demonstrators. The protests came after students staged rallies at the two colleges to demand to take part in the 13th World Youth Festival next month in the North Korean capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. Radical students are calling for unification with the communist North. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has invited South Korean students to attend the youth festival, an athletic and cultural festival attended mainly by non-aligned and communist nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has accused the North of attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. Student leaders charge that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keep the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula divided. They have called for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two Koreas are bitter rivals. They have clashed frequently over the years. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War. Radical students and dissidents have been calling for the fall of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, but they lack support because of their extreme views and violent tactics.

Judge <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON> invoked the controversial `` Hadood Ordinance'' enacted in 1979 by former President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. It was the first such ruling since Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> came to power in December. The U.S.-eductated Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has pledged to press for repeal of the Islamic law, which imposes harsh punishment for moral offenses and limits women's rights. Beg's court convicted <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Qadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON> of marrying illegally because Ms. <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON> failed to secure a proper divorce from her previous husband, <PERSON> Shaikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Anver </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. The court found four of <PERSON> Qadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>'s friends guilty as accomplices for helping arrange his marriage with Ms. <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON>. No date was set for the executions. Members of the <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> families said they would appeal to a <LOCATION> Sindh </LOCATION> province high court. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has called for the repeal of all discriminatory Islamic laws promulgated under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s 11-year rule. As chief of the army, Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> toppled Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in a 1977 military coup and had him executed two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a plane crash in August. An inquiry found the plane was downed by saboteurs but was unable to identify them. Repeal of the laws passed under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> would require majorities in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s sizeable right-wing opposition has said it will block any government move against the Islamic ordinances.

 A storm slammed <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> with heavy rain, winds up to 120 mph and a tornado, disrupting power to thousands of customers and leaving one person dead and one seriously injured. A suspected tornado in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, across the state line southeast of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, destroyed at least one house and a school gymnasium, damaged at least four other homes and knocked out power to about 1,000 customers Friday evening, authorities said. No injuries were reported. The twister landed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s affluent <LOCATION> Society </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> section about 7:15 p.m. and slashed northeast for half a mile to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Police and witnesses said the funnel cloud then skipped across the river and damaged a dozen houses in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The weather service said it had not investigated the Camden damage and could not confirm a tornado there. The body of girl who apparently fell into a rain-swollen tributary of <LOCATION> Cobbs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION> during the storm was found two miles downstream late Friday, said <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>. The victim was identified today as 13-year-old <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lidle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION>. Police said a man was blown into a Society Hill telephone booth. He was listed in stable but guarded condition with a head injury early today in the Hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. The north and west walls of a three-story parking garage collapsed during the storm, damaging two parked vehicles and a nearby house, police said. Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beren </PERSON> said a sudden darkness descended while he was on patrol. `` I could n't see two feet in front of my face,'' he said. `` It was black and dark _ and then there was a roar.'' The tornado was 50 yards wide at points, the weather service said. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said about 4,500 customers lost power for at least part of the evening. A Camden family had to be evacuated from their home after a beam crashed through the ceiling, said <PERSON> Camy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Camden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>.

 Chinese authorities announced tonight the arrests of 400 people accused of attacks on soldiers imposing martial law. The arrests included several leaders of independent student and worker associations. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also criticized a <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcast for reporting that troops killed 3,000 residents, and it claimed soldiers `` did not fire even once'' in their push to drive pro-democracy protesters from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, emerged Friday from three weeks of seclusion to praise soldiers who crushed the pro-democracy protests and show who is leading the world's most populous country. Despite <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s show of political stability, foreigners continued to flee <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today On Friday night, the nationally televised news accused <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, a leading astrophysicist and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, of being a traitor who incited the `` rebellion'' and provoked the violence. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who avoided the student protests on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, has taken refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The official attack on <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to protect him could strain relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has condemned the violent crackdown on the pro-democracy demonstrators. The nationally televised news tonight said the 400 people who were arrested included <PERSON> Gua </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, the independent student group that led seven weeks of protests. It said several other students and workers were arrested but gave no other names. It showed footage of non-students, identified only as `` scoundrels,'' being questioned by police, one under gunpoint. Western reporters saw soldiers take three people into custody at gunpoint on the street. The arrests came as the government intensified a propaganda campaign that claimed troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries were responsible for the violence last weekend, when soldiers in tanks rolled into central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and recaptured Tiananmen Square from student protesters. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today sent a convoy to nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> to evacuate 89 foreign tourists, students, scholars and oil technicians. Most were Americans. They said <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> had been quiet the past week but that they were leaving because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended it. Also today, the People's Daily, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-backed <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> of being `` irresponsible'' in reporting that 3,000 people died. The newspaper said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcast was aimed at instigating hatred and resistance. Official Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said today: `` In the process of clearing out the square -LRB- <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not fire even once at the crowd of people.'' The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault, and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters. Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatally shot along the road and in the square, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports put the death toll at about 3,000. Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> group in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Chinese-language broadcasts of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are hugely popular among people trying to obtain information about events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> outside the government-controlled media. Some <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> channels have been jammed since martial law was imposed on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20. Since last weekend, official television and radio have repeatedly praised the military and accused demonstrators of being counterrevolutionaries bent on destroying the socialist system. Authorities have told all participants in the movement to turn themselves in. Phone numbers have been provided so citizens can turn in protesters. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio said today that city officials had received 167 `` important'' reports by Friday afternoon on the hotlines. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> appeared on national television Friday night with other top officials and in an impassioned speech to military officers, gave the clear message that he was in control. Among those accompanying him was conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, reported to have been ousted from power for opposing the martial law crackdown, was absent. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, while initiating bold economic reforms over the past decade which have improved the lives of millions of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is a political conservative who regards ferment for greater freedom as a threat to the state. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, tens of thousands of troops remain, with large contingents at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and in the university area to the northwest. Armed soldiers were seen guarding a truck bringing vegetables into the city and stopping cars to ask for identification. Demonstrations, some violent, have broken out in more than a dozen Chinese cities since the assault on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend. The official media have reported dozens of arrests of people who joined in anti-government protests. Television showed soldiers patrolling the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters. Police were shown making arrests in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, among the cities where protesters burned buses and blocked roads.

 <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> experienced the pain of hearing that her husband was dead, then the joy of what she called a miracle. After a medical crew spent 45 minutes trying to revive <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> on Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Oswego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> was told her husband was dead. For 40 minutes, she waited in a daze for her children to arrive. Then a nurse noticed that <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> was breathing. `` I just waited there ... waited for my kids to get to the hospital,'' she said. `` When the nurse saw that he was breathing again, everyone was shocked. It was a miracle.'' <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON>'s condition deteriorated somewhat and he was put on a respirator early today, a hospital supervisor said. <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON>, a veterinarian, and a friend, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, had been pronounced dead of electrical shock after an antenna they were installing brushed against a power line. `` He was very, very dead. He was deader than a doornail,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortmes </PERSON>, who had tried to revive <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON>. `` He was a friend of mine,'' <PERSON> Bortmes </PERSON> said. `` I made damn sure I tried everything before I stopped working on him.'' But at 10:45 a.m., Bortmes pronounced <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> dead. Last rites were performed. `` They told me that he had died and had left him to work on the other man,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Labette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, 68, had been putting an antenna on the <ORGANIZATION> Oswego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> practices. Five men were helping them, and all seven had their hands on the antenna when it touched a 7,600-volt power line at 10 a.m. The men were thrown back from the antenna and neighbors who saw the accident rushed them to the hospital. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, the hospital's director of nursing, said <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> had no pulse and were not breathing when they arrived shortly after 10:10 a.m. The other men were in stable condition with burns on their hands and feet, <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Middleswart </PERSON> began breathing, he was transported to the coronary care unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Joplin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he was in critical condition this morning. Although he was breathing on his own Friday night, he was later put back on a respirator, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. She classified him as in a coma and said the extent of brain damage due to lack of oxygen had not been determined.

<HEAD>Premier Proposes Sharp Reductions In Soviet Bureaucracy</HEAD>
<UNK>By ANDREW KATELL ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> today proposed sharp reductions in the vast Soviet bureaucracy and said the remaining government ministries should turn many of their powers over to the nation's 15 republics. Speaking to a joint session of the bicameral Supreme Soviet _ a new 542-member, full-time legislature _ <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said that of the 50 government ministries handling basic elements of the economy _ construction, transportation, agriculture and defense _ only 32 would remain. In addition, he told the lawmakers in a session broadcast live on radio and television that the number of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, or Cabinet that he heads, will be slashed from 100 to 10. The proposals, which the legislature is to vote on later this month, mark another step in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempts to streamline the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bureaucracy he has blamed for impeding his economic reforms They would also transfer many economic management functions to the 15 Soviet republics, many of which are campaigning for greater control over their affairs. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, the 59-year-old technocrat re-elected premier on Wednesday, said the remaining ministries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will focus on long-range planning and on scientific and technological help in the spheres they oversee. The ministries would leave the day-to-day managment they now provide to the republics. At the same time, two special commissions are to be formed, one to handle emergencies such as natural and man-made disasters and another to map economic reforms. Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in March 1985, he has tried to rid Soviet society of a half-century of top-heavy, bureaucratic management `` by command'' epitomized by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The government ministries were a frequent target during 13 days of debate in the new Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> At one point, deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Miloserdny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> for short-sightedness that he said led to `` the disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself urged the deputies to grill the ministers on why they are dragging their feet on reforms. He acknowledged complaints that government ministries `` are restructuring very slowly, if at all'' and said: `` We have to find out what is wrong.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> announced nominees for the Cabinet posts today, and the Supreme Soviet is scheduled to hold confirmation hearings on them beginning June 19. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up its session Friday after hearing <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 68, father of the Soviet human rights movement, say the parliament had `` not fulfilled its main task _ to establish a system of power to overcome economic and social problems, to put an end to ecological madness.'' The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate also claimed that by electing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> president in an uncontested election and investing him with far greater powers in his 5-year term, the parliament had given the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief `` absolute personal power.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to loud applause in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, vigorously objected to what he termed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s attempt to `` abase'' the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' work.

 A train traveling from a <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort rammed into a bus in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, killing 31 people and injuring at least 14 in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second major train accident this week, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The official Soviet news agency said the bus was crossing railroad tracks at the village of <LOCATION> Kamenskaya-Pogorelovo </LOCATION>, 640 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> when it was hit by the train Friday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a railroad worker had flagged the bus driver to move onto the tracks, but the report did not say if he faced punishment. The train, traveling at 50 mph from the popular <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> to the Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, could not stop in time to avoid colliding with the bus, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Twenty-nine people, including two children, were killed instantly and two died en route to a hospital. Fourteen people were hospitalized, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said 46 passengers were on the bus. It did not say whether the train carried passengers or freight. The accident happened at the same spot where 106 people were killed in a collision of two trains on Aug. 7, 1987, the news agency reported. On Sunday, a gas pipeline exploded as two passenger trains were passing on the Trans-Siberian Railroad 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. At least 190 passengers were killed and hundreds injured. Last year, 464 Soviets were killed in accidents at railroad intersections, and 16,013 have died this year in all kinds of traffic accidents, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 When President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> visits <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week, he'll look a lot more like a budding capitalist than a communist. With superpower relations rapidly improving, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is turning his attention to improving his nation's faltering economy. The inquisitive president will find there's much to learn from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the world's richest countries and the global leader in exports. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s main target is to improve the situation of the Soviet population. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has high-tech know-how and high-quality machinery that would be useful for this,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is eager to intensify economic relations with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silayev </PERSON>, a deputy premier in the Kremlin. Soviet officials said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week that an estimated 40 million Soviet citizens live in poverty, and warned the country could face economic collapse in the next years. `` Economic cooperation with the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- is of great importance. It is the basis on which the whole field of relations between the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> and the Federal Republic will be broadened,'' <PERSON> Silayev </PERSON> wrote in an article for the June 6 editions of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The four-day trip starting Monday takes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>, the country's richest state, for demonstrations of high technology and talks with local leaders. <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> is home to <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest company. The state-owned Soviet transport company already uses <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> trucks. The visit also will take <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION> region, once <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland and now a leader in retooling for high-tech businesses. In addition, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will see the Hoesch steel factory, a new Ruhr-area rolling mill that sells to the Soviets. Recent polls show that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is immensely popular in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the growing `` Gorbymania'' will be in evidence wherever the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president reaches out to ordinary citizens. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and other political leaders will be keeping that in mind when they discuss arms control and other international issues with the Soviet chief. `` Gorbymania'' is such an overriding factor that the mass circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper even asked <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> if the visit would help the chancellor's conservative party in this month's European parliament elections. `` Oh, come on now!'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> snapped. `` The dates have nothing to do with each other.'' There has been some concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is growing fond of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> responds that the success of <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON>'s reforms will benefit everyone. And West German businessmen want to be among the first beneficiaries. `` We see a huge market in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Skrzipietz </PERSON>, spokesman for the Salamander shoe company, which sold 2 million pairs of shoes to the Soviets last year. `` Shoes are something everyone needs, and we can provide them'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from the company's offices in the <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kornwestheim </LOCATION>. West German banks have also jumped on the perestroika bandwagon. Perestroika, a Russian term, refers to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and social restructuring of Soviet society to make it run more efficiently. Last year a German bank consortium made a $ 1.53 billion line of credit available to the Soviets for buying West German machinery to help improve the communist country's food, textile and clothing industries. `` A small amount of money has been drawn from this line of credit so far,'' said <PERSON> Pietsch </PERSON>, the economist. <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> is one of the nine banks included in the consortium. `` It takes time to draw on all this money'' because of negotiations on what projects to undertake using the credit, he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is still struggling to attain reforms that would not only help his country's economy but also improve the business climate for foreign firms. `` There is still a very long way to go,'' said <PERSON> Karl-Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, secretary-general of the German <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates business ties between the countries. Soviet-West German trade slumped during the middle of the 1980s but bounced back last year, reaching $ 8.36 billion, up 8 percent from the year before. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is currently the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s biggest supplier in the West, but only about 1.5 percent of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s exports go to the communist country. The Soviets buy West German goods ranging from high-quality machine tools to consumer items. They sell energy products to their German trading partners. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is especially eager to increase the number of joint ventures with Western companies, since such operations employ local workers and give business to Soviet materials suppliers.

 In 1982, a homosexual man with AIDS had a 30 percent chance of living for 18 months. In 1987, he had a 60 percent chance of living that long. In 1982, doctors had only a vague idea of how AIDS was spreading and no idea what was causing it. Today they know its cause, they have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study. `` None of us can be satisfied until no patient dies of AIDS, but there is some progress,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a principal developer of the drug AZT, the only one so far approved to treat AIDS. He spoke at the fifth <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS, which ended Friday. It drew 11,800 people, including 1,320 journalists and hundreds of activists, to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to discuss the scientific, social and human sides of AIDS. The conference's organizers were forced to turn away others because <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s convention center could n't accommodate any more. <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>'s surprisingly optimistic assessment of progress toward better AIDS treatments contrasted with the pessimistic viewpoints expressed a year ago at the last international AIDS conference, in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. Many researchers there expressed disappointment with experimental drug trials and efforts to develop a vaccine. But a year has passed, and the picture has improved. `` Things are moving much more quickly now,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the AIDS program at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. This year's conference was also distinguished by the participation of several hundred AIDS activists who demonstrated inside and outside the convention center every day. They booed government officials for not moving faster against AIDS. They demanded anti-discrimination protection, access to experimental treatments and more money for research. Some of them were people with AIDS, or PWAs, as they often call themselves. Their message was simple. As their hand-lettered, cardboard signs said: We are all living with AIDS. Some scientists said they were unhappy that AIDS interest groups were allowed to attend because the protests distracted the scientists from their work. Others welcomed the reminder of the human side of the disease. In the scientific sessions, several groups reported initial success with AIDS vaccines in chimpanzees and monkeys. Among them was Dr. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>, who attracted media attention as the world-famous developer of the polio vaccine, but whose research findings were said to be no better than those of several other research groups. Some of the most promising research dealt with the development of new drugs for AIDS. AZT is extending the life span of AIDS patients, but it has toxic side effects. And in a disturbing development, studies have shown that the AIDS virus can develop a resistance to AZT, making the drug no longer effective. `` The surprise is it took this long to discover it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. On the other hand, the virus strains resistant to AZT do not seem to be resistant to other AZT-like drugs now under study. `` That's been a surprise on the good side,'' <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON> said AZT is one of a class of drugs called reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It mimics genetic building blocks needed by the AIDS virus to link with genes inside cells to make more virus. Two newer drugs under study, ddC and ddI, work the same way and are among the most promising new agents, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the committee overseeing federal drug trials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As with cancer treatment, the use of a combination of drugs might maximize their beneficial effects while minimizing their side effects, he said. Perhaps the most exciting new drugs are so-called soluble CD4 and its relatives. These drugs interfere with the process by which the AIDS virus invades cells. `` They have to add up to one of our best prospects,'' <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> said. Studies are just starting to show that CD4 can reduce levels of virus in the body, he said. Whether that will improve the health of infected people is not yet known. Some drugs that have been tested have flopped. They include dextran sulfate, which looked promising a year or two ago, and AL-721, a drug that many AIDS patients had pushed for. <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> said he doubted the usefulness of dextran sulfate from the start, but that 50 patients were used to study the drug in response to pressure and criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means that our ddC study would have been 50 patients ahead if we did n't have this pressure,'' he said. But, <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> said, researchers are working as quickly as possible to evaluate new drugs. <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> predicted that the experimental results and the AIDS patients' survival curves would be even better next year and the year after that.

<HEAD>Campaigning For Party Leadership Posts Intense, But Behind Scenes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They have n't bought television time or full-page newspaper ads, but the campaigning is still intense in the precinct of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> where Democrats are trying to fill their top leadership posts. Even at this weekend's <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show, junketing lawmakers may find their gourmet meals interrupted by telephone calls from the candidates seeking their votes in next Wednesday's election. Two of the top three officers the Democrats re-elected just six months ago have resigned their leadership posts because of questions about their personal finances. Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> stepped down rather than continue his struggle against charges by the ethics committee that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income and gifts. The No. 3 Democrat, Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said he would step down rather than face inquiry into a junk bond deal. Last week, Democrats elected <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the former majority leader, as speaker of the House. But even before that vote, the campaigning for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s old job and the whip's job had already begun. In the personal campaigning of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the first person to ask for a member's vote is considered likely to get it. `` If you wait more than 37 seconds after there's a vacancy you're 27 votes behind,'' quipped Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> The two candidates seeking to replace <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as the No. 2 man _ and become the natural successors to the speakership _ are Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who is considered the favorite by most people including <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> supporters, gave up a post in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership to run for president in He announced his campaign for majority leader with a presidential-style press release, declaring he was part of a `` new generation'' that will lead the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic party into the future. And in the current ethics climate, one of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s strongest cards is the feeling that he is certified `` clean,'' because running for president would have exposed any skeletons in his background. He has promised, if elected, he will not run for president in 1992. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> is from the more conservative side of the party, and he says it's time Democrats include that viewpoint in the top leadership. If not, `` We shall continue to lose in national elections. It's that simple,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> enjoys the support of that panel's powerful chairman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said late last week he would reassess his chances on Tuesday, and discussions were already underway for installing a conservative as a top leadership deputy if he did n't win But `` I will not be satisfied personally'' by that, he said. The whip's race is a three-way event with each candidate already in a prominent party role. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> And Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> is the chief deputy whip. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s campaign has had to battle news reports that his personnel practices were under scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. His office sent videotapes to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats on the issue, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> held a press conference attacking the news leaks, and he released affidavits from his staff supporting his claim that he is not the subject of an inquiry. However, the reports appear to have cut the momentum many expected would lead <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to a big win. His supporters still contend he's ahead, but they're not confident a first-ballot victory and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is running hard. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> recently reached a delegation of lawmakers visiting <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. One of his top aides said late last week that he was already on the telephone to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where about six dozen lawmakers were attending the big annual aviation gathering. Both <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> also were burning up the telephone lines, although one top <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> staffer expressed some jealousy at <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s success in overseas calling `` We're trying to save the taxpayers money. We're not doing a lot of overseas calling,'' she said, smiling. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>'s people claim to be within about 10 votes of <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and said they could beat him on a second ballot if no candidate received a majority in the first round. But predicting a winner in the secret-ballot contests _ except in a case like <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s where he's unopposed _ is a risky business. `` I think uncommitted is a very popular candidate,'' <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Goodwill Generating Ill Will in Congressional Debate on Savings and
Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No issue in the savings and loan debate has generated so much ill will as the question of goodwill. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed S & amp; L plan, the most expensive bailout in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor this week, probably Wednesday, and legislators likely will spend most of their time debating what until recently has been an obscure accounting issue. Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about goodwill. Q: What is goodwill? A: Goodwill is the difference between what a business, in this case a savings institution, is worth if shut down and liquidated and what it would fetch if sold as a going concern. Goodwill represents such intangible assets as customer loyalty and name recognition. Q: Why is it important in the savings and loan debate? A: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to force S & amp; L owners to risk more of their own money _ capital _ as a buffer between losses and the government deposit insurance fund. More than a third of the industry's $ 60 billion in capital at the end of 1988 consisted of goodwill, which becomes worthless when an S & amp; L closes. Q: Why do S & amp; L supporters believe the institutions should keep their goodwill? A: Most S & amp; L goodwill is `` supervisory goodwill,'' meaning it was approved by <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L supervisors. Regulators OK'd the accounting break for institutions willing to take failed S & amp; Ls off the government's hands in the early 1980s, giving them as long as 40 years to write the goodwill off their books. S & amp; L executives complain that the government should n't go back on its word. Q: What's the difference between normal goodwill and supervisory goodwill? A: Goodwill usually is determined by what a willing buyer pays for a business on the open market. However, supervisory goodwill is the arbitrary amount assigned by regulators to make takeover deals work. In this case, the goodwill actually represents a hidden loss rather than something of value. Q: Why do critics of goodwill think it's worth going back on the government's word? A: Critics acknowledge that many of the institutions operating with goodwill are healthy in the sense that they are earning profits and most of their loans are sound. But, they say the institutions are dangerously vulnerable because the goodwill allows their owners to operate with little or none of their own money at risk. That's a situation ripe for abuse, critics argue, because those <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would have little incentive to prevent them from speculating wildly with depositors' money. Those looking to phase out goodwill say it's better to be unfair to S & amp; L owners than to be unfair to the taxpayers, who are picking up most of the 30-year, $ 285 billion bill for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout Q: What are some of the compromises proposed on the goodwill issue? A: The bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and endorsed by the administration would phase out goodwill from tangible capital by 1995. Institutions short of capital because of goodwill would be allowed to apply to regulators to avoid the stigma of a supervisory agreement, but they would have to submit a business plan on how they plan to raise capital. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., wants to give S & amp; Ls with goodwill the right to appeal its loss through administrative proceedings Critics, however, say that could delay tougher standards for up to 18 months. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., would simply require regulators to honor past agreements on goodwill and other legislators are proposing variations

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he believes the democratic reform movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will eventually triumph despite the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government's current military repression of the movement. In an interview to be broadcast on the CBS `` Sunday Morning'' program, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was `` optimistic'' about the long-term prospects because `` what we're seeing now is what a lot of us have known for many years _ that communism could n't really be a successful system.'' Regarding the Chinese government, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Those people that are being hard-nosed right now, do n't they have to think twice about whether they want to take on the people in the street?'' He indicated that the reform movement could not be simply stamped out `` when the figures get into the millions,'' counting not just the student protesters but their families as well. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON>, `` Do you feel optimistic enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win some day?'' The former president replied: `` Yes, I do, because this is sweeping the communist world. Just look _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the other day. The first election in more than 30 years, and they voted against communism.''

<HEAD>Frying Pan Blamed for Fire That Left Five Dead</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with police saying frying pan caused
fire, identities of adult victims. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An electric pan loaded with grease caught fire and spread into a blaze that left five people dead and a 2-month-old child critically injured in an apartment building, police said today. Police believe a resident's failure to shut off the frying pan caused the fire Friday, Sgt. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> said. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said investigators found accelerants on two stairways, indicating arson. Fire officials also found drug paraphernalia and said residents were `` free-basing,'' or smoking cocaine, in one of the two second-floor apartments that were destroyed in the three-story building. The free-basing ignited some flames, but it did not appear to have been the main cause of the fire, Battalion Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> said Friday. `` You've got five people dead. It's time-consuming to figure out what happened,'' said Detective <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciolli </PERSON>. Police arrested one resident of the building, <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>, 34, and charged her with possession of a controlled substance. Several other people are believed to have escaped from the apartments, the only ones destroyed in the 24-unit courtyard building. Firefighters found the second floor engulfed in flames when they arrived at the building on the city's South Side Friday afternoon, said department spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Greca </PERSON>. Rescue efforts were hampered by security bars on the rear windows of one apartment, <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 2 months old, was hospitalized in very critical condition with smoke inhalation and serious burns. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, 31, was listed in serious condition with burns and smoke inhalation. Those killed were identified as <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 27, and her three daughters, <PERSON> Melody </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, 11 months old.

<TEXT>
 Scores of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> boarded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy buses and vans from nearby <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to evacuate this port city despite its relative calm after the military crushed the pro-democracy movement in the capital. The convoy of three buses and two vans carried 89 foreigners, mostly Americans, from the Sheraton Tianjin Hotel 75 miles northwest to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport, where many sought flights to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Most of the evacuees were students, teachers, tourists and oil field workers. Many said they were nervous about being so close to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where hundreds of residents were killed last weekend when troops entered <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to quell the student movement for more freedom. But they said it had been quiet in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, the nation's third-largest city with about 8 million people `` This is the calmest city,'' said <PERSON> Chilin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shih </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who was in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> for an international phonetics conference. `` But it only takes two hours for the troops to get here.'' The section of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> through which the convoy passed appeared normal. There were no troops visible, buses were filled with passengers and markets appeared well stocked. `` It's been very peaceful,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` I have n't felt threatened in any way in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students living in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> said there was a demonstration last Sunday to protest the killings in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but not much activity since. `` It's been relatively quiet,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Comeau </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` I think the students lost some of the enthusiasm because of the deaths. They're a little scared now.'' The convoy was arranged by the embassy after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended all Americans leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the recent turmoil. The Americans sipped beer and wine in the hotel bar before filing onto the buses shortly before 3 p.m. for the trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The only delay came just outside <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> when the convoy stopped for a regular passport check by police. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said police were cooperative. When the convoy entered <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> to pick up the foreigners, officers were stationed at major intersections to point the vehicles toward the hotel. `` They made sure we did n't get lost,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortzel </PERSON>, an assistant army attache who led the convoy. The convoy provided the first opportunity for foreigners to travel outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with government approval since the confrontation in Tiananmen Square. No soldiers were visible during the 3 -LCB- - hour trip In the countryside, peasants were seen harvesting wheat and others tending neat vegetable plots. Young men lazily shot billiards at tables placed by the roadside while old women sat talking beside the highway under trees. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, watched the scene from a van window as he smoked American cigarettes and drank Chinese beer with other oil workers who drove six hours from <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province to <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> to join the evacuation. `` We feel it's time to get out before things get bad,'' he said. `` When things settle out, we'll be back.''

 Eighty years after <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> rode his horse across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Badlands </LOCATION> and arrived late for his wedding with <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidler </PERSON>, they still disagree about what kept him. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON>, 101, says he paused after getting the marriage license in <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> to see a jailed ax murderer. <PERSON> Maud </PERSON>, 97, says he stayed to watch the hanging. Both agree he got back before dark, they married that evening on June 16, 1909, and settled down in <LOCATION> Nowlin </LOCATION> _ a prairie town that no longer exists. The anniversary this week of one of the world's longest marriages will be a time for memories and visits Sunday from four generations of descendants. The Guinness Book of World Records lists two 86-year marriages, one beginning in 1753, the other in 1853, as the world's longest, but does n't list the current longest surviving couple `` I think we're lucky to be married 80 years and still have our complete family circle. That's kind of a record itself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The Scotts, who have three daughters, 16 grandchildren, 48 great-grandchildren and 34 great-great-grandchildren, have led quiet, honest, hardscrabble lives. They shared most of the 20th century living in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with stops along the way. They could n't afford a honeymoon and never went any place more exotic than <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Old Age Is Not For Sissies,'' reads an embroidered kitchen wall-hanging. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> are no sissies, and the phrase on the wall reflects their no-nonsense approach and the humor they say played a big role in their marriage. `` I like funny things,'' she said. `` He used to come out with the funniest expressions, and he was witty as could be. He's not that way anymore.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, hard of hearing and confined to a wheelchair, may not be the quipster he was, but he's still sharp. He has a full head of white hair, a strong voice and keen memory. `` All I thought about when I was younger was having a good time,'' he said. `` I thought when you laughed and had a good time, it added to your life. It did, I guess. Something kept me going.'' Their youngest daughter, <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, 72, said one reason her parents got along so well is that they often lived in different places and could n't hear each other much when they were together. `` It was always happy when they got together, but next thing Dad would be off working someplace else,'' she said. `` He was n't satisfied He was always looking.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and picked corn as a youth. He became a barber, charging 10 cents a shave and two bits a haircut, and says he had a brief amateur boxing career at 18 and 19. `` I had about 200 bouts and I never was marked,'' he said proudly, with nobody around to dispute him. `` I never got knocked down. I never was hurt. They put my picture up in the -LRB- barber -RRB- school. I had a smile on my face and they said, ` It was the smile you could n't knock off.' I think I could box a little yet.'' He farmed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and played the fiddle at dances. But he and his wife left the prairies during the Great Depression, when the Dust Bowl took over the land. `` We was dried out and we was froze out,'' he said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> became a railroad car inspector in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. He returned to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> as a house mover, and worked in a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> factory during World War II. When Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> got sick in the cold of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, she and the kids moved to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and she worked as a hotel clerk. She met Babe <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> stayed at the hotel, but was disappointed that he was much shorter than she expected. During World War II, she joined the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, working aboard Great Lakes boats. Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1951, but <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> stayed in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and built houses, visiting during the winter. In 1965, he retired and joined her. `` Nobody is always happy, but we had our share of good times,'' he said. `` You'd wonder where you're going to eat the next meal sometimes, and you'd feel happy when you did. But we never went too hungry.'' Over the years, Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has gone through whole libraries of books. The happiest time of her life was when she was in school. She adds with a laugh, `` I was n't married then.'' She straightens slowly getting out of a chair. `` I must be getting old,'' she said. In the parlor is a photo of <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> made before their wedding. He was 6 feet tall _ 6 inches taller than now _ and straight as a cornstalk, a handsome young farmer with bib overalls and hair parted in the middle. She looked pretty in a long, checkered frock. Her advice for young couples is, `` You have to go in with the idea that you're going to stay together.'' `` We've never done anything dramatic, never met any presidents and never went to jail,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` But we've been a happy family and had a happy time in life. `` I never blacked his eye once,'' she said, `` and he never blacked mine. He might have wanted to, but he never did.''

 Six of eight convicts who escaped from a maximum security prison after killing two guards remained at large Saturday and police announced a $ 300,000 reward for information leading to their arrest. Two convicts, both Turkish Kurds, were captured Thursday just hours after the eight inmates overpowered guards and shot their way out of the prison on this south <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island. Police mounted a massive search of the region and the northeastern <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> coastline for the remaining six _ four Greeks, a Briton and a Tanzanian. A police official said a $ 300,000 reward was offered for information leading to capture of the men, who were serving time for robbery, drug trafficking and other convictions.

 Shocked by antics at last year's <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ball </LOCATION> and threatened with a loss of royal patronage, organizers have banned miniskirts for next month's charity event. And, just to make sure there are no more pictures of disheveled young women in awkward clinches with drunken swains, only a single, discreet photorapher selected by Buckingham Palace will be admitted. `` Last year's ball was simply awful,'' society hostess <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmiloe </PERSON> was quoted as saying in Saturday's Daily Mail. `` It was full of scrubbers -LRB- loose women -RRB-, second-hand car dealers and their bimbos. They were wearing leather jackets and tight miniskirts, not evening wear at all, the sort of clothes you'd wear to a barbecue.'' This year's invitations prescribe gowns, `` minimum length below midcalf.'' <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> let it be known that royal attendance might be off unless the ball cleaned up its act. Organizers said Friday they have been assured that the dancers will include the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, familiarly known as <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON>, who is patron of the Anastasia Trust for the Deaf. The ball is expected to raise $ 160,000 for the charity.

 When the trees in <LOCATION> Sims </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Euclid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, began toppling into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, officials in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb turned to their congressman, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, for help. But when the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> proved reluctant to build off-shore barriers to block the waves battering the park's shoreline, <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON> chose the best way he knew to get the message across that he wanted the job done He composed a single paragraph stating that the Corps `` shall undertake'' the project and inserted it into legislation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hopes to complete this week rushing billions of dollars to veterans, foster care providers and other programs running low in funds. `` This is a bill that is certain to see enactment in some form or another,'' the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democrat said last week in explaining why his provision ended up in the spending measure. <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON> was not alone. Dozens of lawmakers have sought to use the spending measure as a way to get favorable treatment for local projects, a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> ritual with bills that are seen as must-pass. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 3.3 billion version of the legislation last Wednesday, two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved its own $ 3.7 billion measure. The money is for the rest of fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. Bargainers from the two chambers plan to try to work out a compromise package next week and ship it to the White House for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature. But sprinkled into the so-called dire emergency spending bill are provisions from senators and representatives calibrated to elicit smiles back home. There is $ 75 million to rebuild a crumpled radio telescope in <LOCATION> Greenbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home state of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman, Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is ordered to spend up to $ 360,000 for aviation research it conducts with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON>. And Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., obtained $ 275,000 for <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to help farmers cope with drought The net worth of the special projects comes to just a small fraction of the overall bill. But they come under fire from critics who say they add to the federal deficit and show a visceral inability by lawmakers to just say no to spending taxpayers' dollars. `` They're like a bunch of kids in the candy store,'' says <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the bipartisan group that advocates deficit reduction. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> complains that when lawmakers from the two chambers hash out their differences over the bill, few projects for the folks back home are likely to drop out. `` They say, ` I'll take yours if you take mine,''' she says. Lawmakers involved in the process take umbrage at such criticism. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., says federal spending on local problems increases the national wealth And he concedes that the practice is so widespread that he has so far received more than 3,500 requests from colleagues who want special projects placed in next year's spending bills. `` They represent their districts,'' <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> says of his fellow legislators. `` They know what's there.'' In an era of tight budgets, lawmakers have perfected several ways of helping their districts without ordering new federal spending. Some provisions order federal agencies to set aside portions of their budgets for particular projects. Thus, language by <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> GOP Sens. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> requires the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to delve into its coffers for $ 400,000 for research into last summer's forest fires in Yellowstone National Park. Other clauses command bureaucrats to do what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants. That is the case with <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>'s provision, which in effect orders the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to start a $ 1.7 million project it has so far declined to undertake. The money was actually provided in legislation two years ago. Still other sections subtly prod agencies to obey congressional desires. The report accompanying the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bill `` urges'' the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> `` to give serious consideration'' to hiring more workers in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Departments ignore such language at their own risk. Examples of local projects appended to the spending bill include: _ $ 1 million to be divided among <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to computerize their criminal records. _ An extra $ 150,000 for work on an agricultural research center in <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> _ Repeal of earlier legislation blocking the military from changing its strength in The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> once wanted to reduce its forces in the state; it now wants to add a headquarters there. _ Urging the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to buy more apples for school breakfasts, thus helping an industry plagued by the Alar controversy, introduced by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s two senators, Democrat <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> _ $ 6.6 million to subsidize airlines serving small towns in 38 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> calls <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> `` one of the toughest areas in the world. If crack is n't in your house, it's in the hallway or on the corner.'' Amid the drugs and despair, <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> operates an oasis of learning and fun: the Upward Fund, a not-for-profit organization that runs a summer day camp and after school programs for 1,200 youngsters age 6 to 19. Upward Fund teachers and volunteers, working out of an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> elementary school, provide tutoring, job training, drug abuse prevention, dance, sports and even lessons in manners. `` You play with a purpose _ to learn,'' says <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON>. In the gym, kids playing basketball are asked what the ball is made of and how to spell it. A geography lesson sneaks in as the children name the home cities of professional teams. In a room lined with computers, <PERSON> Danita </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 7, guides Snoopy through a maze on her screen. `` I like playing outside, gym and computers,'' she said. Her neighbor, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumardo </PERSON>, 7, agreed. `` They love this program _ and they do n't even know they're learning,'' said <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a single parent who works for a medical research company, said his two sons are `` always kept busy here in a positive way, with computers, arts and crafts, basketball. It does n't give them a chance to get into the wrong things _ the people on the corner and the crack dealers.'' `` Parents are struggling to save their children from the street, and we want to help,'' said <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON>. For adults, there are literacy and English-as-a-second-language classes. Youngsters 13 and up get job training, starting with dress code and attitude. `` They need to know you ca n't just say, ` Where's the man with the job?''' said <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON>. `` And they should have not one career as a dream, but five, in case some do n't work out.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON>, 14, who enrolled in the Upward Fund at age 7, said tutoring in math and reading `` helped me a lot when I was younger.'' Now, he proudly says, he works after school in the Upward Fund office. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 25, said the Upward Fund `` had a big impact on my life.'' <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> helped him get an internship at an insurance company when he was 19, and he now works for the company full-time. In the summer camp, <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> has each child take pictures using three different cameras _ just to make sure a budding <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> does n't go undiscovered Most Upward Fund children live below the poverty line and pay only $ 3 a year to attend the after school program. Much of the organization's $ 600,000 annual budget comes from corporate and foundation donations. <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> speaks proudly of starting an ice hockey program, and beams as he tells how hockey superstar <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> once came to <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> to play with the Upward Fund team. The program teaches mutual respect, too. `` Today, if a kid steps on another kid's toe, he's liable to punch him in the face and go home and get three Uzis,'' <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> said referring to a type of machine gun. `` So we teach them manners.''

 Intelligence experts say they're not surprised that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admits he ca n't say for sure `` who's calling the shots'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Real time intelligence _ that is what is happening now _ is almost impossible to come by,'' said one administration official. The official, who is familiar with the daily intelligence briefings prepared by the Departments of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other sources, said the president's comment that the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is `` very, very murky'' came directly from such reports. At one point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even joked about the problem, saying he'd called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 84-ear-old leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, but `` the line was busy I could n't get through.'' The reason <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have so little information about who may or may not be in power at any given time, or who gave specific orders for the savage attack on the pro-democracy demonstrators, is quite simple, the experts say. `` There's no access. ... If they do n't want to respond to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they sure as hell are n't going to respond to the ambassador,'' the administration official said. He, and others speaking on intelligence matters, spoke only on condition that their names and exact titles not be used. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which only began to open up during the past decade, has traditionally posed a problem for foreigners seeking detailed information. The leaders sequester themselves in special compounds and are not seen unless they wish to be seen. They tend to keep their decisions within a very tight circle, and for the most part, have had nearly complete control over the mass media. The dearth of human intelligence _ that gleaned by personal contact _ has been `` a big difficulty'' in the current unrest, the administration official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats tend to be exposed to their counterparts who `` spout the party line'' in normal times, said another source familiar with the diplomatic scene in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` So when there is a undoubted conflict within the party, government and top military leadership, they are especially careful to keep it obscure from the rest of the world,'' said the diplomatic source. During the past week, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> has met twice with the vice foreign minister in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has called the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> twice. Embassy officials have contacted officials from the Chinese ministry of national defense, the ministry of education and the civil aviation administration. Also, contacts have taken place with some <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military officers who are personally acquainted with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and they have been providing some information. `` But it's not very satisfactory,'' the administration official said The official admitted with some frustration that `` we do n't have any feel for what is going on'' in what he called `` the dark stretches'' of provincial <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The diplomatic source said the government has `` ample reports'' about the situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` But there is an important distinction between being able to observe what is going on the outside and having access to the inner workings of the party and government,'' he said. The administration official pointed out that information culled from technical sources such as satellite photos or electronic surveillance can only go so far in providing up-to-date information. `` Overhead photos ... pictures of troops massed and locations and tanks, that is n't going to tell you who does what to whom'' during a group-by-group or person-to-person struggle for political power, said the official. Although he refused to specifically discuss electronic surveillance, the official noted that the sheer volume of information poses a problem. `` You have a whole mass of information to sort out ... it has to translated, analyzed, and sometimes only after the fact ... do you find something has happened,'' he said. One important source of information is the news media, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials freely admitted they had their eyes glued to the round-the-clock coverage provided by the 24-hour <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> has been one of the sturdy resources for information'' during the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown, the administration official said. `` We can not presume to do without the information that the media transmit,'' said another, calling the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks `` of tremendous importance.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also cooperates with other foreign embassies in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but `` everybody's been somewhat embarrassed, really, at how difficult and unsuccessful they've been in getting any information,'' the administration official said. `` We're all in the same boat.'' Sometimes, the official said, expectations are just too high. `` It's a magic word _ people really think that ` intelligence' people are omniscient, but boy, they sure are n't,'' the official said

 A onetime altar boy who escaped the barrio to become a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student was convicted of pulling six armed robberies during college vacations. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>, 22, showed no emotion as he was convicted Friday by an <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. `` I think that none of us wanted to find him guilty,'' said juror <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanye </PERSON>. `` But there was just too much evidence on most of the counts. And we could n't get his excellent memory out of our minds.'' The prosecution rested heavily on a videotaped confession in which <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> recounted with vivid detail the holdups by a gunman in a ski mask. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> maintained it was a false confession given in a stupor induced by the drug phencyclidine, better known as PCP or angel dust. Jurors, who deliberated three days, acquitted <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> of four other robbery counts, including two that he had confessed to. But they also convicted him of trying to escape from police after his arrest in 1987. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years and four months in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 4. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> was charged with committing 10 armed robberies between December 1985 and June 1987. In the confession, <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> told detectives he robbed fast-food restaurants, grocery stores, a dairy and a drug store. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> testified that he confessed to the robberies in a drug-driven schizophrenic episode, describing crimes actually committed by a friend and drug dealer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Longoria </PERSON>. When Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> pointed out that the friend was in jail during three of the robberies, <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>'s lawyer suggested those holdups were committed by his client's younger brother, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>, a product of a poor <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Habra </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood was an altar boy and <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> `` Boy of the Year,'' and an `` A'' student at his <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> high school. A standout prep football player, he was wooed by more than 60 colleges when he graduated. He chose a scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, where just 4.7 percent of the student body is Hispanic. As a freshman in 1985, he decided to major in psychology. `` He always said, ` Look how good I'm doing. I'm Mexican. I'm trying to make it in a white world,''' his sister, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, once told an interviewer But in a jail interview right after his confession and arrest in July 1987, he said: `` At <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, I did n't fit. I'm a homeboy now.''

 Students whose stubborn calls for democracy brought a military crackdown that left hundreds dead said Saturday they were still trying to understand what happened and ride out a campaign of political repression. `` I'm just trying to leave the country,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student said gloomily. `` For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put up with governments like this. It will take a long time to change.'' The mood of confusion and frustration on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> college campuses contrasted sharply with the spirit one week ago, when most students were confident the government would have to bend to their demand for dialogue. Then came last weekend's military assault on student protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in which nearly 300 people were killed by official count and as many as 3,000 by unofficial count. Student leaders went into hiding. Thousands of others fled home. The few who remained on campuses seemed in shock. All said they still wanted democratic change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and several said they would fight the government from underground. `` This government can not last long. ... The people will rise up and a leader will emerge,'' said a math student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But even the defiant ones acknowledged they had no idea how to put their ideas into action. `` Right now is not the time,'' the math student said. `` Maybe in a few months.'' He paused and thought. `` But maybe students will just go back to school in September and it will stay quiet. Who knows?'' `` I do n't think the ordinary people can do anything,'' said a woman at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Change ca n't come from below, it has to come from above. We have to wait until the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decides to change itself. The leaders are n't concerned for the good of the people _ all they think about is holding onto power.'' By week's end, the government intensified political repression, which included arrests of protest leaders and a propaganda campaign against the students in the state-run media. The government announced Saturday that several student leaders were arrested, including <PERSON> Gua </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON>, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, the independent student group that led the seven weeks of protests in Tiananmen Square. It said 12 people were arrested at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and charged with stealing, but that they were not students of the school. Authorities ripped down protest posters and soldiers patrolled the university district in northwestern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but only one person reported seeing uniformed soldiers enter a campus, and then only briefly. The sprawling, tree-covered campuses of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have become shady havens for about 1,000 students each, or about one-tenth the normal student population. School officials declared an early start to summer vacation, which normally would have begun in two weeks. Most who remained on campus were seniors who said they were waiting to receive diplomas and government job assignments. Others said they were waiting for rail service to return to normal so they could go home. They worked on senior theses, read novels, played ping-pong and basketball and shuffled around their gloomy, hushed dormitory halls, anxiously watching political developments. `` Certainly there will be a serious political campaign of denunciation,'' said the woman at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe many intellectuals will be arrested.'' The official media began to carry a steady stream of reports denying that soldiers killed unarmed civilians and highlighting civilian attacks on soldiers. `` Whenever there is so much propaganda, who can believe it?'' a woman student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said scornfully. But other students worried that people outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> who did not see the soldiers' violent attack would believe government denials. `` Most Chinese are peasants. They believe what the government says _ they want to believe,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` They do n't want to believe foreign news reports.'' Even the students had trouble understanding the attack. `` No one thought the soldiers would fire,'' many said. Amid the confusion, frustration and resignation predominated. `` Nothing can be done now. What good would it be to demonstrate? The government has shown it does n't care,'' said a student from the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>. Many of the protests were directed against Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, 60, who imposed martial law. `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> may die soon, but we will still have to wait for <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to die, and that will take a long time,'' said the woman from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Forget about politics, she advised: `` We should just try to enjoy life.''

<HEAD>Convention Creates an Odd Couple: Las Vegas, Southern Baptists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is about to meet its Maker. The first contingents of up to 18,000 Southern Baptists began arriving this weekend for an `` evangelistic blitz'' in the nation's gambling capital They hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual convention. `` I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you make lemonade,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a convention organizer. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists. `` We want all the conventions we can get and we do n't give a damn who they are,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reible </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The site represents a marriage of convenience for Southern Baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn. The 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has more than doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's largest Protestant denomination. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, a desert town of 5,600 little more than five decades ago, is growing at the rate of 3,000 people a month and there are now about 700,000 people in the region. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> is one of only 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackleford </PERSON>, a convention spokesman. `` It just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation of the people of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to come,'' he said. There are about 22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Six years after the denomination voted to meet in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, the decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have decided to stay home. While conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45,000 people, estimates for the convention running Tuesday through Thursday range from 13,000 to 18,000. Reasons include the reluctance of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> to expose their children to the gambling scene, the city's remoteness from the denomination's strongholds in the Southeast and an apparent lack of burning issues as the struggle between the denomination's moderates and conservatives stretches into its 11th year. Southern Baptists leaders say <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> offers an opportunity to put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism. `` The choice of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> was deliberate in that the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastey </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a moderate group. A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock on doors around <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. To keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin, convention President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> said he is seeking postponement of a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a Religious Liberty Commission. The commission would lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on issues such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for tuition paid to parochial schools. Church leaders said the internal struggle has taken a toll on the evangelistic efforts of the denomination, where membership has increased barely more than half a percent in each of the last two years. `` The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Strack </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelists </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, the conference plans to lead thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> down the gambling Strip to distribute 10,000 New Testaments and 20,000 gospel tracts, <PERSON> Strack </PERSON> said. Las Vegas officials and some church leaders say the city variously known over the years as <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and Lost Wages is undeserving of special attention. `` <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities than any other city,'' <PERSON> Hastey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said life in the residential areas outside the Strip is little different from anywhere else. In addition to bringing in up to $ 15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. `` I think it's good for the city that a group like this is meeting here,'' he said.

 The government has switched from gunfire to propaganda and intimidation following its assault on the pro-democracy movement. Chinese citizens, who have seen the signs before, face what could be the worst state backlash against free thought since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Already, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources say police are arresting intellectuals who supported the seven-week-long student movement. Authorities announced Saturday that 400 people, including student leaders, had been rounded up for agitation. Hundreds of people in cities outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also have been arrested in the unrest following last Sunday's military attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that left up to 3,000 people dead. Student leaders who demanded democratic reforms, press freedom and an end to government corruption have been branded as counterrevolutionaries and told to turn themselves in. Activists charged with the same crime after the `` Democracy Wall'' movement of 1978-79 were imprisoned for up to 15 years. Many Chinese intellectuals, usually the first to suffer when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> asserts its authority, have gone underground. Some student leaders also are in hiding; a few are believed to have fled to embassies. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, is sheltered at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` We now live in terror,'' said one student. Show trials, like the one for <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, and her leftist Gang of Four after the Cultural Revolution are a possibility. Executions of some people accused of attacking police or soldiers seem certain. However, relatively few leading dissidents may face criminal charges. Instead, they could be suppressed in a more subtle campaign of fear and reprisal that also would affect the lives of millions of Chinese. Workers already have been docked pay and threatened with dismissal for participating in demonstrations. The government has begun a massive propaganda campaign to drum home the belief that the military carried out the will of the masses in attacking unarmed protesters. The official press insists that not one shot was fired when troops stormed <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last Sunday. Thousands of reporters had joined the students in calling for press freedom. For one heady moment, they were permitted to print what they saw as the truth. Now, the press is once again a conduit for official pronouncements. One Chinese reporter expressed surprise when a foreigner asked for a copy of the party's People's Daily. `` There's no news in it,'' he said. Repression of free thought has been a fixture of communist rule in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In 1957, leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> lured critics into the open with the slogan: `` Let 100 flowers bloom; let 100 schools of thought contend.'' Within months, he banished thousands of freethinkers to prison and re-education camps. Many victims eventually returned to their lives, only to be caught up in the orgy of violence of the Cultural Revolution. People were persecuted for their intellectual background, their work with a foreign company, speaking a foreign language or traveling abroad. Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is itself no stranger to government repression. In 1976, security forces stormed the square and killed about 100 people protesting an attempt by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s wife and other leftists to seize power. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, himself disgraced during the Cultural Revolution, took power in the late 1970s. He promised then that ideological struggles would no longer interfere with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s urgent need to fight poverty and modernize Last week was not the first time <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has used force, however. When Democracy Wall leaders began to question one-party rule in their daring posters, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> imprisoned dozens of people. He responded to pro-democracy student demonstrations 2 -LCB- years ago by purging party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a reformer and his designated successor. Hu's death in April touched off the new round of protests. Despite his oft-quoted remark that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have to let in a few flies when it opens its windows to the world, he stands firmly against what he calls `` spiritual pollution'' from the West. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and other old-guard conservatives who back him also share a deep-seated phobia of political unrest. Still, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people returned this spring to reassert their demands for greater freedom. They are bound to do so again after this new crisis.

 Fourteen sailors suffered smoke inhalation when a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter carrier caught fire in port, but there was no serious damage to the ship. The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter carrier, caught fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> said. The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where a cable from the shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of the fire was not known, but an investigation was under way. The damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke inhalation were treated and returned to onboard duty by Saturday morning, <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> said. The fire was put out by approximately 10:30 p.m., less then 20 minutes after it was discovered, and repairs to the ship will be made by the crew. The Peleliu had recently returned from operations, but <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> did not know the nature of the assignment.

 Stunned villagers said a woman and her two daughters found drowned in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, bound to cinder blocks, were part of a hard-working farm family. `` Everybody is shocked,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, 19, a waitress at the Village Restaurant, a popular place in the northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community of about 500 people. `` No one could believe it. It's not that it could n't happen to somebody in a small town. The reality is that it did.'' The bodies of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 36, and her daughters, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, 14, were identified from dental records Friday, five days after they were found in the bay _ gagged, with hands bound and tied to cinder blocks, police said. All were naked from the waist down. Police said they had no leads and no suspects. They speculated that the three may have been thrown into the water alive because the bodies showed no sign of trauma, such as shooting or stab wounds. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> police were deluged with telephone tips Saturday, but there was `` nothing hot,'' said Detective <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>. `` We're getting hundreds of calls, but we wo n't know until we check them out,'' he said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said a published reference to a blue-and-white boat possibly linked to the crime spurred most of the calls. `` That boat's been seen from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> to Key West,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said, noting that many pleasure boats fit that description. The victims had been vacationing in the <LOCATION> Walt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Disney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> area and were on the way home when they stopped in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on June 1, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Wendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Creager </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' husband, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON>, who had stayed home to tend the family's dairy farm, reported his wife and daughters missing June 4 when they failed to return. Ms. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> often came into the restaurant to eat breakfast. `` They always looked happy but tired,'' she said. `` You could see that the hard work took its toll on them. It's just so sad what happened.'' `` This grief is forever, a scar no one can remove,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Luderman </PERSON> of Zion Lutheran Church, the family's pastor. `` This is a small, tight-knit community. Everybody knows everybody. We're an extended family and when one person hurts, we all hurt.'' He said special services and counseling might be offered, particularly for young friends of the victims, to help them come to terms with their grief. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> would have been a high school senior this fall in Convoy, where she was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, school officials said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who was about to start her freshman year in high school, was a cheerleader, 4-H member and marching band member. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' 31-year-old brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, is in prison on a sexual assault charge. A second charge against him relating to an alleged assault against <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> was dropped in a plea agreement. <PERSON> Luderman </PERSON> said some residents wonder if the killings and the assault case are linked, though authorities in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are discounting the notion. `` Some of the rumors are ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Luderman </PERSON> said. `` We are trying to stop them.''

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, embarking Sunday on a trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, will confer with Salvadoran government and rebel leaders in a climate of escalating violence that threatens the strife-riddled country's new administration. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s four-day trip is designed in part to show support for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s new rightist president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, whose top adviser was gunned down by assassins on Friday, barely a week after <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> took office. In addition to his talks with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will meet with non-fighting rebel leaders closely allied with the leftist guerrillas, most likely <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, as well as other opposition politicians and the country's military leaders, his office said. Elsewhere on the trip, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will be high on the agenda during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s stops in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He plans to meet with the presidents and other leaders in those countries and also will visit combatants and officials of the Contra movement that has been fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will arrive in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> just days after <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s top cabinet minister, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON>, and two bodyguards were shot down in a blaze of gunfire. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> blamed the killings on the guerrillas, who are organized under the umbrella group <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The White House, condemning the shooting as vicious and despicable murder, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will deliver President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s condolences to the <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> family and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called it `` an attempt to kill not only a man, but democracy.'' During his trip, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also will try to spur the Latin nations into a new plan to bolster thus-far futile efforts to depose <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and step up pressure against the leftist Nicaraguan government, said his press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. The vice president will sound out reaction in the region to further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if an Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> effort fails in its mission to mediate a transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the press secretary said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediation team that last week was given an additional six weeks to resolve the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> stalemate. The team's initial foray failed to budge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power after he invalidated results from the election last month that was widely seen as rigged by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The administration last week blasted <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for sending weapons to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for use against a potential <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attack. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also accused the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> last week of denying the opposition fair representation in the all-powerful tribunal that will oversee next year's elections. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be seeking Latin support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condemnation of what officials say is a continuing pattern of Nicaraguan arms shipments to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist rebels. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is expected to convey a more positive tone than the stern lecture he delivered to military leaders in February. Then he warned that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> risked cut off of its more than $ 1 million-per-day in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid unless it made progress on human rights and a quashing of death squad activity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are pleased so far with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s young government. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will underscore the need to maintain scrupulous human rights standards in the face of increasing scrutiny by congressional and other critics who fear the ascension of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s Arena party heralds a new open season for death squads. The rebels have pledged to make the country ungovernable under <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s political opponents say the polarization they foresaw under <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> governance has begun.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he believes the democratic reform movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will eventually emerge victorious despite the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government's current crackdown against the movement. In an interview to be broadcast on the CBS `` Sunday Morning'' program, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was `` optimistic'' about the long-term prospects because `` what we're seeing now is what a lot of us have known for many years _ that communism could n't really be a successful system.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the leadership in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, like Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, faces its most serious challenge from hard-liners within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` he -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- came in and found he'd inherited an economic basket case, so he knows that his opposition is going to be behind him Not the people out in front of him. It's going to be that Politburo Well, the same thing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Regarding the Chinese government, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Those people that are being hard-nosed right now, do n't they have to think twice about whether they want to take on the people in the street?'' He indicated that the reform movement could not be simply stamped out `` when the figures get into the millions,'' counting not just the student protesters but their families as well. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON>, `` Do you feel optimistic enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win some day?'' The former president replied: `` Yes, I do, because this is sweeping the communist world. Just look _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the other day. The first election in more than 30 years, and they voted against communism.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, interviewed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was asked about his feelings on the May 5 conviction of fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on three charges _ aiding and abetting obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, destroying government documents and taking an illegal gratuity _ in the Iran-Contra affair. North was acquitted on nine other counts, including false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, obstruction of a presidential inquiry, conversion of traveler's checks to personal use and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said about the verdict: `` I was not disappointed in the fact that nine of the charges were dropped.'' But he said he was `` handicapped'' in making any substantive comment because <PERSON> North </PERSON> is now appealing the conviction. `` That is before the courts and I do n't want to say anything that is out of line. Besides which, I have a handicap around this whole thing. It has been falsely portrayed in most of the press, the whole Iran-Contra situation. It has been portrayed as if we were trading arms for hostages with the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as it was then,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 With names like Sub-Human, Project SQUID, <PERSON> Gossamer </PERSON> <PERSON> Albacore </PERSON> and Speed Stick for their ocean-going inventions, it may seem that entrants in the national human-powered submarine races take the whole thing lightly. But competition promises to be fierce when 19 teams from universities and corporations around the country gather June 23 to 25 for the race sponsored by the H.A. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> Foundation for undersea research. Made of lightweight materials, most of the subs will be propelled by humans pedaling bicycle drive trains. One sub is arm-powered and another works with a push-pull operation. Two-member dive teams wearing scuba gear in their flooded, but sealed, submarines must maneuver around a mile-long, kidney-shaped course in ocean water that is about 23 feet deep in this inaugural race. Teams will be rated on speed, of course, but also such other factors as cost efficiency and design innovation. Ocean engineering majors at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are putting the finishing touches on their entry, the FAUtilus. `` From what we saw out there when we were on the course, it's going to be difficult to get the submarines out and running,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAU </ORGANIZATION> team leader <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoelzer </PERSON> The lightweight subs will have to maneuver in the strong surf at nearby Singer Island. He coordinated design of a 12-foot, cigar-shaped submarine with the lowest volume and surface area _ features that he believes will lead the student project to victory in the 15 - to 20-minute race But that's what the other teams think, too. `` Everybody's going to win. You talk to the guys at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and they're fastest. They wo n't even think about anybody else winning. The guys at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> are the same way,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Linskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, foundation director and race coordinator. <PERSON> Hoelzer </PERSON> openly frets about reports that the Gossamer Albacore entry by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> was built for speed with the help of 15 engineers, and that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> brainpower was borrowed by <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> midshipmen for their teardrop-shaped Project SQUID, short for Submerged Quick Intervention Device. `` Oh, good. We got them worried,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Isomura </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of engineering programs. But he acknowledged his team ran into trouble running its torpedo-shaped sub in murky waters. `` In our bay, where we were trying to run, we could n't see five feet in front of us,'' said <PERSON> Isomura </PERSON>. `` We could n't even see what direction we were heading. We're running into problems, too. That'll make them happy. <PERSON> Hoelzer </PERSON> believes he has the advantage of early sea trials because the <ORGANIZATION> FAU </ORGANIZATION> sub took a nosedive into mud, capsized a canoe and broke essential parts at a time when mistakes were expected and adaptation was possible. The top prize is $ 5,000. `` There's going to be schools against corporations, schools with sweat equity up against corporations with supercomputers,'' said <PERSON> Linskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>. `` If there's a guy whose vehicle is very, very fast who spent tons and tons of money on it, he may not win the whole prize.'' Various cash and trophy prizes also will recognize the team with the most flair and flamboyance and the team that shows the best sportsmanship and fortitude, she said. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gongwer </PERSON>, a 73-year-old inventor whose <ORGANIZATION> Innerspace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, manufactures propulsion systems for remote-control robot subs, is pushing his Knuckle Ball as an innovator.

Both of <ORGANIZATION> FAU </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots are women who are compact enough to fit in the 2-foot-wide, 3-foot-tall chamber. The Knuckle Ball is arm-powered, `` just for the heck of it,'' said <PERSON> Gongwer </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, a retired physician and project participant. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> is using a rowing machine-type, push-pull propulsion method with the human engine lying face down. The <ORGANIZATION> FAU </ORGANIZATION> pedaler will sit with legs outstretched facing aft. The MIT power source will be lying on his back, facing forward.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> wound up his Scandinavian tour Saturday by calling on the region's tiny Roman Catholic flock to unite in a battle for human rights and social justice. The pope flew back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after celebrating Mass at <LOCATION> Vadstena </LOCATION>, site of the relics of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s patron saint, <PERSON> Birgitta </PERSON>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> late Saturday afternoon on a special <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> DC-9. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said his last Mass of the trip under a drizzle at a 16th century castle built during the reign of King <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasa </PERSON> when the Protestant Reformation swept <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. It was attended by 2,500 youths from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the nations the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> visited on the trip. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Linkoping </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle against poverty in such areas as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He said the pope was welcomed in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> by all faiths, as well as by non-believers who valued <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s efforts to advance human rights. The main goals of the pope's visit were to meet with Scandinavian Catholics, less than 1 percent of the population, and to work toward better relations with the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. As the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> approached his plane on Saturday, he left the red carpet, walked over to a group of wheelchair-bound people and laid his hands on their heads. In <LOCATION> Vadstena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> reiterated a main theme of his 10-day tour of the five affluent, overwhelmingly Lutheran countries. He reminded the youths that `` a high standard of living does not automatically bring happiness and inner peace.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> called on them to pursue justice and to proclaim human dignity for all people. `` There is no room for selfishness or apathy in your lives,'' he said. During his visit, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> challenged the sexual and family mores of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, speaking out against abortion and divorce. Before leaving, he blessed the foundation stone for a new Catholic church in <LOCATION> Linkoping </LOCATION>. The stone was a gift from the city's <LOCATION> Lutheran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> `` This noble gesture recalls our common heritage ... in spite of our historical divisions, we are sincerely striving to respond to God's grace and build up together what was once torn apart,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. He urged all Swedes to `` persevere in the great religious traditions and values that are at the source of your national identity.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the tour `` exceeded expectations, both in the holy father's spiritual encounters with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minorities and his ecumenical reception by leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, which closed its public schools during a student-led uprising last year, will begin reopening them soon.

 Kurdish rebels on Saturday accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of razing several towns and forcibly relocating 19,000 people in a drive to stamp out the Kurdish identity and carve a security zone along the Iranian border. Diplomats and other sources in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> say the government already has moved up to 500,000 Kurds and destroyed about 3,000 villages in a major relocation effort over the past few years. They say it is aimed at cutting off the rebels from sympathizers and breaking up the tight-knit Kurdish clan system. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> acknowledges relocating people but denies forcing residents to leave. A Kurdish official speaking in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s city of <LOCATION> Arbil </LOCATION> said Saturday that Kurds in the region have suffered `` long years of backwardness,'' and that the resettlement is `` a non-political and non-partisan issue.'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Qader </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Naqshabandi </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the autonomous region, said in an interview that the relocation is `` only a communal program aimed at uplifting economic and social standards of villagers.'' Rebels refuse to join the council, which was elected on the basis of 1974 agreement for limited autonomy for Kurds, and consider its members pro-Iraqi. `` The Iraqis are pressing ahead with their mass deportation plan, and they're getting away with it,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, a leading rebel group. `` We'd hoped that Western government pressure would prevent this happening, but it has n't.'' The rebel spokesman spoke in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where Kurdish leaders are seeking international support. He demanded anonymity. According to reports from the <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, government forces dynamited about 2,400 homes in the towns of <LOCATION> Twosuram </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sengeser </PERSON> and the nearby villages of <LOCATION> Qadirawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madhobizinan </LOCATION>, Soorkanh, <PERSON> Gelk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mankan </PERSON>, the spokesman said. He said they first forcibly evacuated about 13,000 people to settlements near the ancient city of <LOCATION> Erbil </LOCATION>, 60 miles to the west. The evacuated area is seven miles northwest of <PERSON> Qala </PERSON> <PERSON> Diza </PERSON>. Some reports say that city's population of about 200,000 Kurds also is being relocated. Kurdish rebel officials said last week that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> tanks had moved into <PERSON> Qala </PERSON> <PERSON> Diza </PERSON>, 15 miles west of the Iranian frontier, to enforce the evacuations. The rebel spokesman said some residents barricaded themselves in their homes and called a general strike in an unsuccessful effort to resist. It was not known if there were casualties. The rebel spokesman also said troops evacuated the 6,000 residents of <LOCATION> Dagalah </LOCATION> last week. There was no immediate confirmation of his claims. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was trying to create a 50-mile-wide security zone along its border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and that it hoped to `` destroy the Kurdish identity.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been battling for an independent homeland for decades. The Kurdish rebels sided with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. A short time before both countries agreed to a cease-fire last August, the Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, killing an estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last fall. Since the cease-fire went into effect, the Iraqis have stepped up their campaign against the Kurds, the rebels charge. The rebel spokesman said Iraqis have destroyed 19 religious centers and shrines in the region `` to eliminate any reason for Kurds to return on pilgrimages.''

 Thousands of radical students battled riot police with rocks, clubs and firebombs in street clashes Saturday to demand the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Police arrested more than 1,000 people in the confrontations, which came on the second anniversary of the start of the June 1987 riots that brought down the authoritarian regime of former president <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Opposition groups denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> for deciding not to hold a promised referendum on his presidency and demanded he go ahead with the vote. Violence broke out in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when students hurled rocks and bricks at riot police who tried to stop protest marches. Police fired volleys of tear gas and made baton charges to disperse protesters. Saturday afternoon shoppers ran for cover. Students yelled, `` Crush the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo regime'' and `` Yankee go home.'' Police officials said more than 1,000 protesters were arrested and that there were dozens of minor injuries on both sides. One police commander said up to 5,000 people took part in the protests, the worst in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> since labor and student protests in late April. The government deployed 20,000 riot police to block protests. Thousands of troops in combat fatigues and visored helmets guarded downtown and key government buildings. About 20 busloads of riot police ringed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. Protests began earlier Saturday when riot police blocked demonstrations at two colleges by about 2,000 radical students demanding to be allowed to attend a youth festival next month in communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has invited South Korean students to attend the athletic and cultural event, which mainly draws participants from non-aligned and communist nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has accused the north of attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. About 1,500 students battled riot police with clubs and rocks at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when troops blocked them from marching off the campus. About 500 protesters at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fought police with firebombs and rocks. Thousands of students then gathered in the city center, where more fighting broke out as protesters called for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s resignation. Student leaders denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charging they keep the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula divided. They called for unification with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two Koreas are bitter rivals and have clashed frequently over the years. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s radical students and dissidents lack public support because of their extremist views and violent tactics. Opposition groups issued statements Saturday denouncing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> for announcing on Thursday that he will not hold a promised referendum on his performance. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised the vote during the 1987 presidential election campaign. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said he decided to forego a vote because it would create unrest. A defeat in a referendum would discredit <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and put pressure on him to resign. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had to hold a referendum or the opposition would be forced to mount an anti-government campaign. `` We can not but fight ... if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> intends to avoid the interim appraisal,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. About 250 students and dissidents Saturday ended an anti-government hunger strike at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic cathedral. Protesters, who had been fasting since May 25, took part in a candlelight vigil as hundreds of riot police ringed the cathedral. The officers did not intervene.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday rejected a complaint from the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which criticized the broadcast service for carrying a report that 3,000 residents died during the crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators. `` The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> checks its information prior to broadcast to be sure the facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurey </PERSON>. The People's Daily, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-backed <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> of being `` irresponsible'' in its reporting. The newspaper said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcast was aimed at instigating hatred and resistance. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, an official who spoke on condition he not be identified noted that there have been `` many credible reports'' of civilian deaths in last week's disturbances. Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatally shot along the road and in the square, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports have estimated the death toll at about 3,000. Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> group in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> carried a report Saturday that claimed that in the process of clearing out <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not fire even once at the crowd of people.'' The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault, and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters. In response to the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> added three additional hours of radio broadcasts in Mandarin, bringing to 11 hours the amount of programming beamed daily to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> estimated recently that the service has a listening audience of `` over 100 million'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. During the unrest, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities have tried to jam <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcasts.

 Fifteen protesters against the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, seeking a day in court, got themselves arrested Saturday on a more serious charge than normal for such demonstrations. `` We feel fine about that. We've been trying to do that for three years,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, a spokesman for the anti-nuclear group, <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Twelve adults and three juveniles were arrested shortly after 7:30 a.m. as they tried to block traffic at a gate to the stalled $ 6 billion plant, police said. The adults were released on bail or personal recognizance and the juveniles were held until their parents took them away. All 15 were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, an offense that carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of a $ 1,000 fine and a year in jail. A three-day demonstration last weekend at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> resulted in 734 arrests, although most of those arrested _ some more than once _ were charged only with a criminal trespass violation. A violation is a summons, like a parking ticket, that carries a maximum $ 500 fine and does not have to go to trial. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the purpose of Saturday's blockade was to get tougher charges filed so the group could get a court hearing. `` This was basically in response to some TV news shows Tuesday and Wednesday where the police, etc., were saying that people would n't do this if the charges were more serious,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the demonstrators hoped to be tried as a group and with a jury. A hearing was scheduled for July 10 in <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The Seabrook reactor was completed nearly three years ago, but federal regulators and objections by officials in neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> help up issuance of a license for low-power tests until last month. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s operators had hoped to start the first chain reaction last week, but wo n't be able to do so before at least the middle of this week. Three faulty safety valves had to be taken out for modification by the manufacturer. They have been returned to <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> and were being re-installed Saturday, said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his family took a whitewater rafting trip down <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest river Saturday after the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> lowered the water level for a smoother ride. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and children <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> put their raft into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 10:30 a.m., accompanied by guides and three rafts filled with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> informed raft operators that it would decrease flow from <LOCATION> Bluestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, 40 miles upriver, from 14,000 cubic feet per second Friday to 8,000-10 ,000 cfs Saturday, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanger </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Songer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whitewater </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> `` He'll have a ` kinder, gentler' ride,'' said <PERSON> Hanger </PERSON>, adding that recent rains also would smooth the course over rapids from <ORGANIZATION> Cunard </ORGANIZATION> to Fayette Station. The Quayles took a shorter trip than most rafters _ three hours instead of four _ and exited the river about a mile downriver from the usual landing. The vice president spoke with reporters before the trip but not afterward. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remarked on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s beauty, and mentioned a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration environmental proposal that could reduce demand for the state's high-sulfur coal. `` We're going to be submitting clean air legislation and this -LRB- rafting -RRB- will be in the spirit of clean air,'' he said. `` We'll get out and taste a little bit, and have a little fresh air today and enjoy the river and the scenery in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday is expected to propose legislation requiring a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by the end of the century to combat acid rain. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, reminded of the bill's possible impact in an area where abandoned coal towns already line the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, laughed, then backed off of his remark. `` I know I should n't have mentioned that,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, a Democrat and a whitewater rafting enthusiast, greted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Cunard </ORGANIZATION> but did not accompany him. State Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, the only Republican holding statewide office in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, went along on the trip. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is at the bottom of a canyon rising to 1,000 feet. The northward-flowing river _ its name notwithstanding _ predates the glacial era, and geologists say that its age is comparable to the Nile's. The vice president, who had been whitewater rafting once in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, set aside Saturday for his family before embarking Sunday on a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Quayles were clad in shorts and wore life preservers required on rafting trips. After about 15 minutes of instruction, they put their raft into the roily waters. An unexplained one-hour delay in the Quayles' departure caused authorities to postpone other rafters' launches. A group that had started its trip upriver at <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> was forced to tie up for 1 -LCB- hours along the river bank and wait until after the Quayles took off. `` Good morning, Mr. Vice President,'' some of the rafters shouted when the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION> passed them. Other rafters were displeased that the river was n't at full strength. `` I was expecting something a little more challenging,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, Del. `` But I understand. After all, he is the vice president.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> made a 45-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> part of the national park system in 1978, shortly after the area was opened up by the completion of four-lane <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 19 over the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Premier Announces Major Trimming of Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Saturday announced plans to abolish 18 state agencies, slash the number of Cabinet posts, and surrender some power to the republics in the biggest government overhaul of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been streamlining and decentralizing the Soviet bureaucracy because he blames it for impeding his economic reforms. The Cabinet, or <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> _ which <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> heads _ has been widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes. Speaking to a joint session of the nation's new two-chamber legislature, the Supreme Soviet, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said of the 100 Cabinet members appointed in 1984, only 10 will remain. He also told the session, broadcast live on state-run radio and television, that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries, construction, transport, agriculture and defense, only 32 would remain. One of those eliminated will be the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees production of chronically scarce consumer goods. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, a 59-year-old technocrat re-elected premier on Wednesday, said the remaining ministries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would abandon day-to-day management of the country's industries and focus instead on long-range planning as well as scientific and technological work. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who came to power in 1985, has said his goal is to rid Soviet society of a half-century of top-heavy, bureaucratic management `` by command'' epitomized by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. In earlier phases of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program, ministry staffs were cut by thousands, and several ministries were consolidated into a superagency for agriculture. In March, however, the leadership decided to abolish the superagency, which was blamed for mismanagement of food production and distribution that has left some grocery shelves bare. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said some economic management functions will be transferred to the 15 Soviet republics, many of which are campaigning for greater control over their affairs. He mentioned specifically that the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> would be abolished and that republics would control building supplies. Several lawmakers have complained that shortages of construction materials cause long delays in projects. Despite the proposed reductions, two committees will be formed _ one to handle natural and manmade disasters and another to plan economic reforms. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, a prominent economist, will handle the economic panel. The government ministries were frequently criticized during 13 days of debate by the new <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which ended its session Friday. At one point, Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Miloserdny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> blamed the Cabinet for short-sightedness that he said led to `` the disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged deputies to grill ministers on why they are dragging their feet on reforms. He acknowledged complaints that the agencies `` are restructuring very slowly, if at all.'' `` We have to find out what is wrong,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suffers from a budget deficit projected to reach $ 162 billion this year, inflation estimated last year at 8 percent to 9 percent, and poverty that affects millions of people. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Saturday announced nominees for the 10 Cabinet posts that will remain. Supreme Soviet committees are scheduled to hold confirmation hearings beginning June 19. Among those nominated to remain in their posts are <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police chairman <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. The full Supreme Soviet is to reconvene June 26 to vote on the nominations and then draft legislation in a session that will last a month and 10 days, Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> announced. In other work Saturday, the Supreme Soviet named heads of 14 committees to oversee such areas as state security, law enforcement and farming in addition to economic reform. Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was named head of a committee on construction and architecture.

 The inaugural session of the new <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may in the end prove more frustrating than elevating for a nation that has begun demanding results to match its leaders' talk. Frequently contrasted of late with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where there was economic reform without political reform, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has made dramatic strides in opening its political system to popular participation and unrestrained debate. But one point that debate harped on during the first session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies was the failure of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring, to produce tangible improvements in people's lives. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a superpower with missiles but little meat. Its people have money but nothing to buy. Giant factories produce pollution, but to no end, for no one wants their shoddy products. The result is a grinding sort of poverty and frustration bred by chronic shortages and compounded by a new national awareness that life is n't like that elsewhere and should n't be at home. What's more, there is general agreement things are getting worse as everyday goods disappear from stores, black marketeering flourishes and inflation saps peoples' savings Yet the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after two weeks of mind-boggling televised criticism that five years ago was hardly expressed around a kitchen table for fear of being overheard, adjourned on Friday leaving no particular course for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to follow, no consensus for a new program of action. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the meeting `` the most outstanding event in the entire history of the Soviet state'' and said it heralded `` a new stage of perestroika.'' Certainly in terms of free expression, that was true. But human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, whose presence as a deputy testified to the genuineness of the new democratic spirit, said on the final day that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had failed in its main task as he defined it: `` to establish a system of power to overcome economic and social problems and put an end to ecological madness.'' Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who had called on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve at least one program to cure a social ill, told the Supreme Soviet legislature on Saturday he agreed with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s criticism `` We have not been offered a short-term program, economic and financial, which would lead our country out of the dead end,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. There have been many cries recently, including at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for the government to import popular consumer goods as a way of demonstrating that those who heed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pleas to work harder and better will have something to buy with the rewards they earn. Without some incentive, there seems little reason for people to risk breaking from the stagnant environment <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> so often rails against. But Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who heads the mammoth bureaucracy charged with carrying out <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the state can not afford to finance what would only be a quick fix. He revealed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is carrying a $ 52 billion debt to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and is spending $ 20 billion a year to buy technology, chemicals, raw materials and food from abroad. After servicing its debt, he said, the nation already is running a $ 14.6 billion annual deficit in convertible currencies. His alternative approach, announced to the new Supreme Soviet legislature on Saturday, was to reorganize the bureaucracy for at least the third time since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power four years ago.

 The top student at <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, who has a child and is seven months pregnant, delivered the valedictory speech Saturday despite earlier doubts school officials would allow her to do so. `` You and I are special,'' <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said told 400 classmates during commencement ceremonies held at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We made many sacrifices and some of us even went against all odds.'' Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, 18, became a center of controversy in April when an article about her for the school paper was killed by <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The article, titled `` Against all odds ... Student becomes valedictorian despite motherhood,'' detailed Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s first pregnancy, and how she was shuffled among relatives after her mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the school newpaper article was too personal. He cited a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in January 1988 that upheld the right of school authorities to censor school newspapers. Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said she doubted school officials would allow her to give the valedictory address since she was pregnant a second time. But officials later said there was no policy preventing her from giving her speech. The petite student, wearing a bright red cap and gown, had to pause and start her speech over as <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> lowered the microphone for her. `` There were almost 1,000 of us that rushed through the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the sound of the bell,'' in 1985, she said. `` In less than four years, over 50 percent have disappeared. Where did they go?'' she asked. `` You and I are special. Special because we did n't give in to drugs, alcohol or peer pressure.'' Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who shared the stage with other honor students, including <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Nealey </PERSON>, her boyfriend and father of her unborn child, was first to receive her diploma. She also was recognized as an honorable mention for the award of outstanding graduating girl. Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> attained valedictorian status by maintaing straight A's in such honors classes as physics, calculus and economics. She plans to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> to study chemical engineering and has $ 17,500 in scholarships. Before and after the ceremonies, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> eluded reporters and photographers. The publicity about her graduation has helped Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> financially, said <PERSON> Shuronda </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, editor of the school paper. `` People have sent money and offered things. I think it helped her know that there are still people out there who care about other people in this world. That everybody makes mistakes. She's gotten letters from girls who are in her same situation.'' `` And I think her story also lets others know that they can beat the odds,'' she said. Student <PERSON> Tammi </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who wrote the censored story, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s scholastic achievements belie stereotypes that pregnant teen-agers ca n't go far in life. Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and her daughter, 20-month-old <PERSON> Terrisha </PERSON> <PERSON> KeAndrea </PERSON>, are living with her boyfriend's family. <PERSON> Nealey </PERSON>, a National Merit Scholar, was vice president of the graduating class.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys have pared by five the 37 allegations of perjury for which he is on trial and are preparing to call at least three congressmen to testify. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> ruled Friday that the five of the 37 alleged statements that gave rise to perjury charges are not relevant to the case. But he did not throw out any of the 10 perjury charges outright, saying he would take defense motions for dismissal under advisement. The 32 remaining disputed statements are divided among the 10 charges. While the jury took a day off in the 2-week-old trial, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> also indicated that he personally believes at least some of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s allegedly perjurious statements were indeed false. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in early 1988 about his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing as a money launderer, and with a <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate since convicted of money laundering. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was negotiating to obtain $ 850,000 from the agent for construction of his home. The statements eliminated from the case involved questioning about whether two exact terms were used during <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s money discussions _ `` narcotic'' and `` hiding'' as it pertained to the source of the money. Defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> has subpoenaed at least three members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to testify in the case, presumably in an effort to refute the prosecution notion that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> should have been familiar with money-laundering laws. The three are Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. House officials have filed a motion to quash the subpoenas of <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> and <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> on Friday deferred ruling on until it becomes obvious they are to be called. The Coble-McMillan motion said that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is expected to respond separately. <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> did not say how many congressional representatives he has subpoenaed, but he said some have indicated they will testify. The jury returns Monday to begin hearing the defense portion of the case. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a two-term Republican, lost his seat in a bitterly contested race to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former actor on television's `` Dukes of Hazzard,'' last November, after the indictment was returned His attorneys contend he was duped by friend and associate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, who acted as middleman in the loan deal. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> testified before the grand jury that he `` walked away'' from the money deal after a Sept. 13, 1987, meeting with <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and the undercover agent. `` The evidence is clear he did n't walk away from it,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said in court Friday. `` The statement is literally false.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, in his quest to become the first black governor since Reconstruction, was tapped Saturday as the Democratic nominee at the party convention. `` You had the courage to stand with me four years ago,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said, in reference to his 1985 underdog campaign that made him the first black elected to statewide office in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Also nominated were businessman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for lieutenant governor and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> for a second term as attorney general. Under state law, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> can not run for a second consecutive term. `` The experts said it could n't be done,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a 58-year-old father of three whose daughter <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, an artist, gave one of the seconding speeches for his nomination. `` But together, we did it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said her father taught her to be undaunted by risks. A Wilder victory on Nov. 7 would make him the first elected black governor in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. At least one black served as governor, but not as an elected governor, for a time in the South during the period after the Civil War. His Republican opponent will be chosen Tuesday in a bitterly contested primary from among former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>. Polls released last week showed the three <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders neck-and-neck and each slightly leading <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in a head-to-head contest. But the Democratic ticket has swept all three offices in the last two statewide elections, including <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s precedent-setting victory as lieutenant governor four years ago `` The people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> do not want to turn back,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. `` They know <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is moving in the right direction. They want to continue our progress and prosperity.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> and his predecessor, former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, even though he has publicly feuded with both men on issues ranging from tax policy to giving credit for election victories. At the convention, the three men clasped hands and raised them as the 5,300 delegates and alternates cheered. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, said in a seconding speech for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> that their differences `` pale by comparison to what those Republicans are saying about each other.'' He said he might not have been elected lieutenant governor in 1977 and governor in 1981 without <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s help. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who was the target of a coal miners' protest at the convention, said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> reminds him of the verse of poetry that ends, `` Paddle your own canoe.'' `` Well, I've looked out the window of the governor's office on more than one occasion and, sure enough, there was <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> paddling by. But he was always nice about it. He always waved,'' <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said. He said he admires <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> because `` he knows what he believes in and has the courage to stand and be counted.'' About 150 labor delegates at the convention stood silently and turned their backs to <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> while the governor delivered the keynote speech. The protest was over the sending of state troopers to the <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> mountains </LOCATION>, where some 1,700 members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union have been on strike since April against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> operations. `` We think he's turned his back on us by putting at least a third of the state police out there escorting coal trucks and harassing our people,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON>, a convention delegate from <LOCATION> Wise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a grandson of slaves and a former state senator from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, came to the convention unopposed for the nomination. A bid by state Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wythe </PERSON> drew little support and <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> dropped out of the contest earlier this year.

 The bishop of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, jailed for 30 years by the Chinese Communists until his May 1988 release, called for freedom and peace in his homeland during a memorial Mass on Saturday for the students slain in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Kung </PERSON>, who was released from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> prison for medical reasons, made his comments shortly after the secretary of the interior laid a memorial wreath at the Statue of Liberty `` as an eternal reminder of the cause'' for which the students died. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 500 to 600 people protested outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and erected a 20-foot plaster replica of the Statue of Liberty in a nearby park. The statue, however, was barely visible from the embassy because it was largely shielded by tall bushes. About 200 Chinese students and supporters demonstrated in the northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> under banners with such messages as `` Give Me Freedom Or Give Me Death'' and `` Students In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, We Stand On Your Side.'' The two ceremonies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> marked the second consecutive day of pro-student activities in the city in the wake of last weekend's shootings in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> On Friday, more than 15,000 people packed Dag Hammarskjold Plaza outide the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after a memorial service and mock funeral procession through <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, saying the spirit of the pro-democracy forces would never be forgotten, placed the memorial wreath on <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at a brief Saturday morning ceremony. `` Sadly, we come here today to commemorate those who lost their lives in the quest for freedom in their own lands,'' said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>. `` We were horrified by the brutal reminder that there are strong forces in this world who seek to snuff out the flame of liberty.'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, standing beneath the Statue of Liberty, thanked the students for inspiring Americans by erecting the <ORGANIZATION> Goddess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a statue inspired by Miss Liberty that stood in Tiananmen Square. Later, about 100 people filled the <ORGANIZATION> Transfiguration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Kung </PERSON> deliver his comments. `` I am happy to be here, but at the same time very sad,'' <PERSON> Kung </PERSON> said in his sermon, which was read by a translator. `` I am happy to pray for human rights, but sad for the innocent youths who have been brutally murdered.'' The 88-year-old bishop was jailed in 1958 for his refusal to renounce papal authority. Since his release last year, <PERSON> Kung </PERSON> has since been receiving medical treatment in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The death of the Chinese young students is a great tragedy in Chinese history. All of you who live in freedom, through your prayers, must support our suffering brethren,'' said <PERSON> Kung </PERSON>. After saying Mass, the frail, bespectacled bishop blessed a shrine inside the church set up to `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square martyrs.'' A dozen wreaths sent by various groups in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> surrounded the shrine. After the Mass, dozens of parishioners lined up to pray at the memorial. In the schoolyard adjoining the church, pro-student groups set up tables to collect donations in the fight for democracy. There was one pocket of support for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's decision to use military force against the students <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Flounders </PERSON>, a member of the national committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the socialist organization backed the Chinese government. `` We feel it's in the interest of the working people and oppressed people all over the world to support the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government,'' she said, labeling the student uprising `` a counter-revolutionary development.''

<TEXT>
 Two faces of the Rocky Flats nuclear plant were presented by its operators and its federal overseers, an affidavit and internal memos revealed after federal raids shut down the facility as unsafe last week. Hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plutonium reprocessing building while it was closed for safety violations, the affidavit states, yet the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>' managers bonuses each year as rewards for production and management A July 1986 Energy Department internal memorandum said <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> was `` in poor condition generally in terms of environmental compliance'' and its permit applications were `` grossly deficient.'' The memo also indicated some of the plant's waste facilities were `` patently illegal.'' Plutonium triggers are made at the plant, northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Yet an ad for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the facility's operator, appears in the current edition of a metropolitan weekly, the <ORGANIZATION> Broomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, inviting the public to tour the plant. Officials said the tours were the company's method of explaining to neighboring communities how the nuclear weapons plant operated and why. The Rocky Mountain News quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying that the ad was placed before the investigation. Another DOE memo, written July 14, 1986, said favorable news media attention had been garnered for Rocky Flats officials who negotiated a cleanup agreement with regulators, rather than the bad press they might have deserved. `` Much of the good press we have gotten from the agreement ... has taken attention away from just how really bad this site is,'' the memo said. Energy Department officials supported the statements of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> executives about plant safety and performance they allegedly knew were false, according to the affidavit that was unsealed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here. The affidavit was made public after it had been used earlier in the week by federal agents to obtain warrants for the raids. Some of Rocky Flats' top managers since 1980 are among the DOE and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> officials named in the affidavit as possible co-conspirators in violation of hazardous waste laws. They include <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Romatowski </PERSON>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchini </PERSON> and J.E. Door. But representatives of the department and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the affidavit. It says DOE and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> officials are suspected of collaborating on making low waste estimates at Rocky Flats. They also are accused of making false statements regarding waste disposal at the facility. At that time, the plant's plutonium-reprocessing facility, Building 771, was supposed to be shut down for four months afer three safety inspectors were accidentally exposed to radiation. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, using infrared cameras during flights over Rocky Flats in December, detected burning in an incinerator in Building 771. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sanchini </PERSON> publicly were saying the building totally was shut down. <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> also were accused of misleading regulators in 1985 by certifying that Rocky Flats' groundwater monitoring system complied with federal requirements. The affidavit says that certification was found to be false and in violation of federal law. <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were accused of claiming that a number of wastes were nonhazardous, when in fact they were hazardous. A Nov. 13, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo by <PERSON> Romatowski </PERSON> to other department officials advised that the agency should resist the efforts of environmental and public health authorities trying to clean up Rocky Flats. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> also is conducting an investigation into performance bonuses awarded Rocky Flats' managers. The DOE paid bonuses each year, ranging from $ 2.3 million in 1981 to $ 9.4 million last year, to reward <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> for its production and management performance at Rocky Flats. In addition to the raid by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> agents, the plant also came under fire Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which announced it had found 25 environmental and procedural violations at the plant.

 Syrian and Christian gunners exchanged rocket and artillery fire Saturday, killing four people and wounding 12. Arab officials, meanwhile, sought to halt the fighting and reportedly were trying to gain support for a peace plan to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. A police spokesman said the Syrians, entrenched in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, blasted the Christian coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with 130mm howitzer shells and 107mm rockets. One round struck a residential district near the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing four people and wounding seven, he said on condition of anonymity. Five other civilians were wounded in a retaliatory barrage on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during which <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units under Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opened up with 155mm howitzers, he said. The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people killed and 1,432 wounded since the latest round of fighting began on March 8 between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 forces and allied Syrian and Druse Moslem fighters. The clash began when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said cost the state treasury about $ 100 million yearly. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> responded by blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Thuds of exploding shells shook the capital as <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an Arab League envoy, shuttled twice between the Christian and Moslem sectors for talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, and <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, his Moslem rival. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called a cease-fire on May 11 but the fighting did not stop. The league renewed the call at a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, May 23-26 and appointed a three-member committee to devise a peace plan. But Syrian forces kept shelling the Christian coastline, claiming they wanted to prevent Iraqi supplies from reaching <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by sea. These barrages have drawn occasional retaliation from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces. <LOCATION> Ibrahimi </LOCATION>, an Algerian diplomat, left for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> later Saturday. The Arab committee is comprised of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Their foreign ministers arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Saturday after three days of talks in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>, who reportedly pledged to assist their mission. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the Arab world's traditional rivals, are on opposite sides of the Lebanese civil war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, with 40,000 troops in northern and eastern provinces as well as west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, is the Moslems' main supporter. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> supports <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has vowed to drive the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said the Arab foreign ministers were soliciting support for a seven-point settlement proposal. The plan, according to the paper, calls for `` exerting international pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied a self-designated `` security sone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1985 in an effort to stop cross-border guerrilla raids. According to An-Nahar, the peace proposal would include the `` deployment of an Algerian force'' along a 75-mile-long coastal stretch from <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, to prevent the import and export of illegal goods. It also calls for lifting all sea, land and air blockades.

 Millions of bicycles clog cratered streets, electric trolleys lumber down tree-shaded avenues and dim neon signs flicker above hole-in-the-wall bars. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> grinds on after authorities made some arrests and issued warnings of tougher action aimed at preventing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city from becoming the new focal point for the pro-democracy movement crushed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week. The fist of authority has come down, less forcefully in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> than elsewhere, but strong enough to stifle the reappearing protests. Security forces have swept through <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities in recent days arresting scores of students and workers, including at least 21 in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. In the last few days protesters wrought havoc on <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s traffic, blocking intersections with buses and concrete barricades On Friday they held a rally in People's Square that drew 50,000 supporters _ largest anywhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the bloody suppression of the democracy uprising June 3-4 that left at least 3,000 dead Facing virtually no opposition from authorities in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, which unlike <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is not under martial law, activists seemed headed toward shifting the focus of the fight for freedom and expanded rights to this city of 12 million. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON> gave what was viewed as a conciliatory speech Thursday, urging civic obedience so troops would not be called into the city. But authorities issued a clear warning against further unrest. `` We want to sternly warn certain ... students not to go any further on this dangerous road,'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio said Saturday. `` There is a limit to the restraint of the people of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>.'' There was also a heavy police presence Saturday, with a motorcade of 17 police motorcycles with sidecars and a small convoy of trucks carrying workers urging rigid support of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> swooping through the city. A major handicap for students' propaganda efforts is the lack of news about what has happened in the capital 670 miles to the northwest. `` The government says 23 students were killed, but how do we know way down here in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>?'' asked a 33-year-old delivery man. `` We know the students say many more were killed than the government says, but we have no idea who's right,'' a mechanic said. `` We do n't get any news.'' Since before last week's bloody crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, provincial students had been returning to the countryside to inform the masses about the revolution. But <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> students have not been particularly energetic in spreading the word. There were scattered posters in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> earlier this week calling for a general strike, but they have largely disappeared, residents say. Instead, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> citizens seem to be absorbed in other kinds of posters. In the city center, people stared intently at pictures of a bodybuilding contest, movie promotions and shoe advertisements tacked up along raucous <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. Several clusters of people gathered at People's Square Saturday to exchange opinions about the previous day's mass rally. `` I'm outraged, but I'm very afraid. I do n't dare speak out,'' a research scientist said. `` Our media is just communist party propaganda. We all listen to the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts every day to hear the truth.'' Several people around him nodded. Like all those interviewed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the scientist insisted that his name not be used. The Chinese government began a new form of terror Saturday, playing foreign news reports on television and urging informers to identify Chinese who spoke on camera. About 200 students from <PERSON> Shahghai </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tongji </ORGANIZATION> universities held a rally and sit-in in front of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> police headquarters to demand the release of nine labor leaders arrested Friday. `` If they decided to press charges then they must do so in the open, but they insist on doing it secretly,'' said a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Tongji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at the protest. The arrests appeared to be part of a nationwide campaign to create a split between students and workers. By cracking down on labor, authorities undermine a main source of support for the student movement. At <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, about 90 percent of the students have returned to their homes out of fear of troops entering campus to arrest students. Along the main path into campus there is an 8-foot plastic foam model of the statue of liberty made by a neighboring school and paraded around the city in marches before the May 20 imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Student leaders were divided earlier this week over whether to continue disrupting city life. `` We finally agreed to an end to the barricades because the loss in production caused by them becomes the people's burden,'' one senior said. Diplomatic sources estimated production fell off in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, a major industrial base, by as much as 50 percent after the barricades caused widespread absenteeism at factories. With arrests stepping up in the last few days, it is time for the democracy movement to pause and assess its lessons, students interviewed at <LOCATION> Fudan </LOCATION> said. `` Most peasants do n't understand our 1989 movement at all,'' one freshman said. `` We must now concentrate on bringing the peasants into play. Sheer fear and a need for quiet reflection are thus likely to keep <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> from becoming the kind of rallying point for democracy that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was. `` The people of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> are not cowards,'' said a young bank teller at People's Square. `` But we are afraid of getting killed.''

 Israeli soldiers opened fire Saturday on Palestinians protesting new identity cards and an 8-year-old boy was struck in the chest and fatally wounded, a doctor reported. Hospital officials said the boy was one of 30 Arabs wounded during clashes with troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. According to residents of the Jabaliya refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers in jeeps used loudspeakers to announce that a week-long military curfew on the strip would be lifted to allow residents to obtain new computerized identity cards. The cards are needed for Palestinians to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> <PERSON> Muranakh </PERSON>, a camp resident, said about 200 Palestinians began a protest march shouting slogans against the new cards. `` Youths started pelting the troops with stones and the soldiers then opened fired,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> nurse <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamudeh </PERSON>. A doctor at the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> clinic in the camp said <PERSON> Shadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 8, was hit in the chest by a rubbet-coated metal pellet and died despite an emergency operation. <PERSON> Muranakh </PERSON> said the boy was standing outside his uncle's home watching the demonstration when troops opened fire from about two yards away and wounded him. An army spokesman confirmed the death, but gave the boy's age as 12. The spokesman did not provide the circumstances of the death. Army officials have accused <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists of encouraging children to participate in protests to act as shields for older organizers and to serve propaganda purposes when they are wounded. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s death raised to 514 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began 18 months ago. Twenty-two Israelis also have been slain in the violence. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said 28 Palestinians, including <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, were wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They said two Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The army announced late Saturday that the curfew would remain in effect on the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp when it is lifted from the rest of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Sunday. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said in a radio interview that the army had succeeded in breaking a boycott ordered by the underground leadership of the uprising. The leadership called on the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands to stop paying taxes, tear up identity cards, and not cooperate with the military government. `` The opposite has happened,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` The individual today needs and depends on the civil administration, and therefore there is no more talk of a popular revolt.'' `` On the other hand, we have not been able to prevail over the sporadic stone throwings,'' he said.

 Local police have allowed roving bands of armed youths to rampage through cities in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and attack minority Turks and their homes, according to news reports Saturday. Officials said at least 80 people have been killed in the week of violence in the Central Asian republic. The number of deaths was expected to rise as security forces searched through the rubble of hundreds of burned-out homes. One report said about 1,000 people have been injured. Col. Gen. Y.V. <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told Soviet television that a group of 5,000 `` extremist youth'' appeared in the city of <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION> Friday afternoon and attacked government office buildings and <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> neighborhoods. `` For the first time, we saw a great number of automatic firearms carried by the attackers,'' he said. Soviet Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said the inability of the local police to protect the Turks was `` shameful,'' according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Usatov </PERSON> accused police of looking the other way, another news report said. `` The attacks of the extremists are more frequently taking on the character of organized military action,'' said the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> and other officials blamed the rioting on outside agitators who they said went to the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> region of the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in trucks and buses. The area is about 1,650 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet television's evening news program `` Vremya'' reported Saturday that several thousand youths armed with knives, axes and clubs drove around <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION> in stolen vehicles. It said they carried out attacks that left 86 houses in flames, 11 people dead and 121 injured. A videotape showed burning houses and overturned cars. The Vremya correspondent said the figures were for a two-day period but he did not say what the days were or if the death toll was in addition to the 80 previously reported. Authorities said at least 9,000 security officers have been dispatched to stop the violence. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> as saying soldiers had not fired on the mobs. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said at least one local police officer was among the dead. The fighting began June 3 between ethnic Uzbeks and members of the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority, who were forcibly resettled in 1944 in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> by the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> activists have blamed unemployment, working conditions in the region's cotton fields and poor food supplies for increasing local tensions. The Vremya correspondent said 10,000 people demonstrated in downtown Kokand Friday demanding that cotton prices be increased, a local chemical factory be closed and that the Meshki Turks be resettled elsewhere. <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> who came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seeking a meeting with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blamed poor economic conditions for the unrest, but they also accused bands of attackers from other areas of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> for starting the arson and killing. The official press had initially characterized the rampage as clashes between the two ethnic groups. More than 11,000 <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> are being guarded in emergency refugee camps. Most of their homes have been burned down, and the rioters were increasingly turning on police stations and government officials, the reports said. In one case on June 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said police saved the regional party leader, who had been captured and doused with gasoline by a mob. It did not identify the official. `` One thing is absolutely clear,'' <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Evil forces that want to destabilize the situation, interfere with perestroika, are behind these events.'' He said he had not determined who was responsible. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said people had been ordered to temporarily turn in firearms, but only 87 had done so. More than 3,000 other guns have been seized, it said.

<HEAD>U.S. To Interview Monk Who Reportedly Saw American POWs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is sending a military attache to interview a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> monk who reportedly saw American POWs in Vietnamese prison camps recently, despite <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s assertions that it holds no prisoners. The <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk, <PERSON> Iwanobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, 65, has been hospitalized in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with what are termed mental and physical problems since he was freed in January after 14 years' imprisonment in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In the past week, Japanese media reports and his daughter have said that <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> shared a cell with Americans in the re-education camp where he was held. The Vietnamese Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> denied the claims, reiterating that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> holds no prisoners from the war, which ended in 1975. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has for years pressed <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for an accounting of the 1,730 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and 634 missing elsewhere in the war zone. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday that a military attache planned to fly to northern <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> Sunday to interview <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> and the information will be relayed to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought to interview <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> earlier but until now had been turned down by his daughter, <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON>, on grounds he was too ill, said the embassy spokesman on condition of anonymity. Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> on Saturday said her father had shared a cell with three American prisoners for the last six years before returning to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` My father told me that when he asked them if they were Americans, they nodded,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> said in an interview from her home in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> on Hokkaido, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island. The prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, she said. A spokesman for the hospital where <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> is being treated said he suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment, and only his daughter can understand what he says. <PERSON> Hidenori </PERSON> <PERSON> Hareyama </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Shiraishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokushukai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Hokkaido said that <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s speech is at times incoherent. Ms. <PERSON> Takutsaka </PERSON> said her father had a stroke three years ago. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> had been a city councilman in <LOCATION> Mibari </LOCATION> on Hokkaido before he became a monk in 1966 and emigrated to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He set up a temple in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and became a South Vietnamese citizen in 1973. He was arrested in 1975, after the takeover of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by Communist forces. On Jan. 20, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> released him on humanitarian grounds after appeals from international human rights groups including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> said her father does not remember the names of the three held in his cell, but said they were still `` young and healthy.'' <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> told her he saw more American POWs, perhaps more than 10, before he suffered a stroke. `` My father is still afraid somebody will come and get him to throw him back in the Vietnamese prison,'' she said.

<HEAD>Namibian Refugees Begin Returning; Angolans Join Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 300 people have crossed into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the first sign of a massive repatriation under terms of a U.N.-supervised independence process for this South African-ruled territory, officials said Saturday. The refugees included both Namibians returning home and Angolans fleeing the Angolan civil war, said <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s administrator general. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> has registered more than than 41,000 Namibians at camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> who want to return home, and a U.N.-supervised airlift is to begin Monday. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said the refugees crossed the border Friday on foot and had no food or possessions other than the clothes they wore. They were temporarily being housed in tents, he said. When <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence process began April 1 some guerrillas belonging to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, the group fighting South African rule, entered the territory from bases in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Fighting with security forces ensued until <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> ordered the guerrillas to return to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Namibians fled their homeland to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> over the years to escape the 23-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war between the security forces and the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Under a regional peace treaty signed in December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to end its 74-year rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in return for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> where they fought alongside government forces. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said he did not know how many Angolans fled into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in recent days, but he believed they will be granted refugee status by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Angolans fleeing to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> did not receive refugee status previously. In recent months, there have been reports of sporadic fighting, but no major battles, in the Angolan war. It was not clear whether the Angolans leaving their homeland were fleeing a new outbreak of fighting or if they simply decided to accompany the returning Namibian refugees in hopes of receiving <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> assistance. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been at civil war since 1975, and most of the fighting between the Marxist government troops and the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels has been in the southern part of the country, near the Namibian border. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -RRB- was not part of the peace agreement and has continued to fight for a power-sharing agreement with the Angolan government. Under <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence plan, elections are set for November. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is widely favored to win, but they will need a two-thirds' majority in order to control the new government. No formal date has been set for independence, but it will likely be early next year.

<HEAD>Authorities: Farmer Kills Self After Deputies Find 41 Cows Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARIBAULT, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A farmer said to be in financial straits killed himself after sheriff's deputies discovered the carcasses of 41 cows that had been dead in his barn since winter. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turek </PERSON>, 42, shot himself in a field on his farm about 14 miles north of <LOCATION> Faribault </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning, Dr. <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner, said Saturday. Sheriff <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweisthal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Turek </PERSON> shot himself in the face with a .22 - caliber rifle after leaving a suicide note, which his family declined to give Turek's body was found by a son. A deputy was first called to the farm Monday night, when a neighbor complained about a strong odor coming from the property. `` He was told there was a dead hog and some dead turkeys and he told them to clean them up because of the complaints,'' the sheriff said. When deputies showed up at the farm again late Tuesday with a search warrant to enter the barn, <PERSON> Schweisthal </PERSON> said, `` He kind of hung his head. Later, during the course of night, he seemed fine and asked what would happen.'' Authorities explained that he might face misdemeanor charges related to the dead cows in the barn, but tried to reassure the farmer that he would n't have to go to jail, the sheriff said. Turek told the deputies his cows had become sick over the winter and died despite his efforts to treat them, but offered no explanation about why he left their bodies in the barn, the sheriff said. Four hours after the deputies left, Turek's family reported he had shot himself. `` It does n't make a lot of sense. He put a crop in this year. The crops look good,'' <PERSON> Schweisthal </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Turek </PERSON> and his family have `` had a tough go of it financially.'' `` He was trying to ... get back on his feet farming,'' <PERSON> Schweisthal </PERSON> said. `` There are still some unanswered questions that we may never know the answers to.''

 Authorities filed murder indictments against three people Saturday in connection with 15 slayings in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> blamed on a cult of devil-worshipping narcotics traffickers. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, a 24-year-old <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> college student authorities call the cult's high priestess, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 22, pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> was a companion of cult `` godfather'' Adolfo de <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was one of several of <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s homosexual lovers who belonged to the cult <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s bodyguard and, authorities say, his executioner in a death pact.

 The last ashes of union martyr <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> were scattered Saturday at a cemetery where five unionized miners had lain in unmarked graves since being gunned down at a coal mine nearly 62 years ago. `` It's high time you got back among your own people again,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>, a poet with the Industrial Workers of the World union in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, as he scattered <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s ashes over the graves. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was an organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> IWW </ORGANIZATION>, one of the earliest unions whose members were also called <ORGANIZATION> Wobblies </ORGANIZATION>. A granite marker with the names of the slain miners and of a sixth miner who lies in a family plot in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was unveiled in the green, neatly mowed cemetery about 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The dead, who were among 500 striking miners accompanied by wives and children, were killed at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 21, 1927, by state militiamen and mine guards using machine guns and rifles. The strike was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> IWW </ORGANIZATION>. A marker commemorating the <ORGANIZATION> Columbine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION> was unveiled Saturday on <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Highway 7 about a mile south of the old abandoned mine and four miles east of the cemetery. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was an immigrant from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> who became a Wobbly organizer and songwriter. In 1915, he was executed by a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> firing squad for the murder of a grocer in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had been organizing workers. Supporters said the mining industry framed <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who maintained his innocence to the end. At his last request, his body was cremated after a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> funeral, and on May Day of 1916 his ashes were divided and scattered in many states _ except <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where he said he would n't be caught dead. The envelope containing the ashes scattered Saturday wound up at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> through a postal error, and remained there another seven decades. Last fall, the archives returned them to the <ORGANIZATION> IWW </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> is best known to many modern Americans through the ballad `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>,'' which folk singer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON> sang at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. One stanza runs: `` From <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> up to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> @ In every mine and mill @ Where working men defend their rights @ It's there you'll find <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> ...'' During a general strike in 1927, the <ORGANIZATION> Columbine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> was the only one operating Strikers and some family members went there Nov. 21 to try to persuade miners to join them. Rocks were hurled back and forth before a miner climbed up on a closed gate and yelled, `` Come on!'' He was hauled down by police and beaten. Pickets surged forward and burst through the gate, but were met by withering gunfire from militiamen and guards, who had at least two machine guns, according to historians and witnesses. Five of the dead _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastenes </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanudakhis </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovich </PERSON> of Erie; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidovich </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> _ were buried in a plot at the <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> cemetery bought by the <ORGANIZATION> Wobblies </ORGANIZATION>. The Wobblies, however, did n't buy headstones and the miners' families could n't afford them The sixth miner killed, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> was buried in his hometown. Saturday's ceremonies were sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> IWW </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> and the Erie, <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> and state historical societies.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bloody crackdown on students demanding more democracy has sent shivers of fear through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> _ British and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territories to be turned over to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by the end of this century. <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s Executive Council -LRB- cabinet -RRB-, said Saturday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s decision to let only certain categories of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents resettle in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would divide the colony. She said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a moral obligation to give a `` home of last resort'' to all of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 3.25 million people who are entitled to British passports. A vast majority of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s people are Chinese. The colony is to be returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in July 1997 under an agreement signed in 1984. In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will stand by an accord signed with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Portugese </LOCATION> enclave in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Under a 1986 agreement <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will cede <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, which has a population of about 500,000, to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Dec. 20, 1999. In both the British and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> accords <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> promises to allow the two territories to maintain democratic structures and mixed capitalist-socialist economies for at least 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty. <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> expressed concern over the military supression of pro-democracy groups in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in which hundreds of people were killed, the <LOCATION> Portugese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said in a statement to the people of <PERSON> Macao </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> said a climate of liberty, democracy and tolerance is needed for economic progress and social justice. Thousands of people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> have joined demonstrations protesting the violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In talks last week between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> rejected proposals to give the right of resettlement to all <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers reported Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government was prepared to admit up to 250,000 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents _ mainly current and retired civil servants and leading businessmen. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s lawmaking <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declared after a meeting Friday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has `` a fundamental moral duty'' to give all residents entitled to British passports the right to resettle in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said of the category system: `` We believe it would be a disservice ... at this time when there is such unity to separate the community into the haves and the have-nots.'' She said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` may decide to give out ... ` X' number of passports on some kind of categorization system but the rest will continue to demand their rights.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guardian newspaper reported <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is prepared to offer asylum to political refugees from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It quoted <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s secretary for security, as saying screening procedures have been established at at the border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> province `` even though it is recognized that this move will add to the growing tensions between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks British officials. The Guardian said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> stressed that so far there have been no requests for asylum among the handful of Chinese who cross illegally into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> daily. The newspaper said that in the past such illegal immigrants were sent back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> within 24 hours. Anti-China demonstrations were reported Saturday in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Portuguese newspapers said hundreds of university students held protest rallies and student leaders at <LOCATION> Coimbra </LOCATION> university declared a period of mourning until June 14 for the people killed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s martial-law crackdown In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> student representatives delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> a petition they said was signed by 12,000 people condemning the massacre of pro-democracy desmonstrators in <LOCATION> Bejing </LOCATION>. They said the petition also denounced the `` witchhunt'' under way to seize the leaders of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> demonstrations.

 Easy Goer, the beaten favorite in the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> and Preakness, foiled Sunday Silence's bid for the Triple Crown on Saturday with an eight-length victory in the Belmont Stakes. Ridden by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the colt's winning time of 2:26 was the second fastest Belmont in 121 races, after Secretariat's 2:24 when he won the Triple Crown in 1973 with a 31-length victory. Instead of Sunday Silence, the 4-5 favorite, becoming the 12th winner of the Triple Crown and the first since 1978, he became the 12th 3-year-old to win the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> and Preakness only to lose the 1 -LCB- - mile Belmont Sunday Silence, under <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, was second behind pace-setter <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Voyageur </PERSON> into the backstretch and Easy Goer was third. Sunday Silence took the lead midway through the turn, but Easy Goer snatched it away with a quarter-mile remaining. Sunday Silence finished a length ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyageur </ORGANIZATION>. Awe Inspiring was 12 lengths back in fourth, followed by <PERSON> Hawkster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Imbibe, Irish Actor, Triple Buck and Fire Maker. The winner paid $ 5.20, $ 2.80 and $ 2.40 to his backers in an estimated crowd of more than 60,000.

 A high-tech navigation satellite designed to tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied military forces where they are within 50 feet anywhere on the globe _ on land, sea or in the air _ rocketed into orbit Saturday. The three-stage <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket finally made it on the sixth launch attempt. Bad weather wiped out four tries, and the fifth was aborted at the last second when an engine valve failed to open. The valve was replaced. The Delta 2 blasted off its launch pad right on schedule at 6:30 p.m. and left a fiery trail in a clear sky as it darted over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported that the 12-story-tall rocket had performed flawlessly in launching the Navstar satellite into an initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` We had normal spacecraft separation. Everything appears to have gone extremely well with today's launch,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> launch commentator. On Tuesday, an on-board motor is to fire to shift the satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up. The $ 30 million rocket carried a $ 65 million Navstar Global Positioning System satellite, which could enable military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases to within 10 feet. Guided by the satellite, a submarine could unleash a nuclear missile to strike within a few dozen feet of its target. A stealth bomber could sneak up on its mark without turning on tell-tale radio or radar. The satellite, effective in any kind of weather, also was expected to keep track of military units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth of a second. American and allied military users would receive information from a coded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellite system, would monitor an open channel providing them with a position accuracy of 300 feet. The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS contains an atomic clock with an error rate of one second every 300,000 years. The satellite is the second of 21 upgraded <PERSON> Navstars </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning information. The first advanced Navstar was launched aboard the maiden flight of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 on Feb. 14. Seven earlier-model Navstar satellites are orbiting the Earth. The new model has more power and improved systems and has added the coded military channel.

 Residents of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION> Society </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood spent Saturday cleaning up debris from a tornado, grateful no one was killed and only one person was injured in the 120 mph winds. The twister, which measured 50 yards across, touched down at 7:15 p.m. Friday and traveled a half mile before crossing the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wealther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The same storm also spawned a tornado in northern <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> that ripped off roofs and tree tops and flattened the newly built gymnasium at a private school. <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said seven houses were made uninhabitable around <LOCATION> Hockessin </LOCATION>. In western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, nearly 3 inches of rain fell in three hours in parts of <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Venango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, carrying one home off its foundation, damaging a bridge and washing out several roads. A 30-year-old man who was using a pay phone when the tornado struck remained hospitalized Saturday with a concussion and facial cuts. To the west of the city, a 13-year-old girl died after apparently falling into a rain-swollen creek in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, authorities said. The funnel cloud in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s colonial section toppled several trees, blew out windows and caused two walls of a four-story parking garage to collapse, crushing two cars parked outside and damaging a home. But the twister, the first in the city in four years, skipped over houses and an adjacent outside mall of shops and restaurants. The garage walls fell into a small cobblestone street to the north and into a vacant area and a couple's back yard to the west. `` It's amazing no one was hurt,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntzinger </PERSON>, general manager of <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION>, the company that runs the New Market Parking Garage. `` If it had blown out the other way onto the front street, who knows how many people would have been killed?'' The falling rubble punctured the roof of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyano </PERSON>'s home, broke several windows and crushed their patio furniture and grill. `` My husband heard this swoooooooosh and then a boom and the whole house shook,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Troyano </PERSON>, who was at work when the twister hit. `` He's still in total shock.'' But, she said, `` It could have been much worse. He could have been hurt.''

Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, after a 3 -LCB- - hour meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, promised economic aid to encourage progress `` on the path of democracy and reform,'' according to a statement issued by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office It said the measures include a $ 7.75 million annual contribution to a managerial fund to train Poles in `` a more market-oriented economy.'' British sources said the promised help fell short of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s hopes for new direct credit lines Supporters of Solidarity, the free union movement that won scores of victories in Sunday's election, demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and draped a statue with banners in Solidarity's red and white colors. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> commented on the election in an interview with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Channel 4 television network. `` We went into the election as a very fragmented front, in contrast to Solidarity,'' he said. `` Perhaps because we are burdened by a kind of complex of guilt for so far not having sufficiently applied all sorts of democratic procedures, we wanted to be super-democratic, super-pluralist,'' he added. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, speaking Polish with his remarks translated into English, also said `` the reforms are irreversible and we're going to carry on with them.'' The statement from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office said she told <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> she welcomed the communist authorities' promise to stand by the election results. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will play a role in getting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 38 billion foreign debt rescheduled by Western creditors, according to the statement released after the meeting. But it said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will encourage new loans only under an International Monetary Fund economic reform program. Outside the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarski </PERSON>, leader of the British-based movement Solidarity with Solidarity, said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s visit was a `` massive publicity stunt'' by Polish communist authorities `` They have lost and he has no right to come here as a representative of the Polish people,'' said <PERSON> Jarski </PERSON>. `` If he claims he wants to restore democracy then his first step must be to resign and have really free elections.'' <PERSON> Jarski </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> with the communist leaders responsible for crushing the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We have not forgotten that it was <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> who sent troops to crush democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'' said <PERSON> Jarski </PERSON>, who referred to the killing of striking ship workers in 1970 at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyards and the imposition of martial law in December 1981. Solidarity, established during strikes in August 1980, was suspended under martial law and subsequently outlawed by Parliament. It was legalized again under an April pact with the government that opened the way for the elections. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s visit is aimed at widening contacts with Western governments. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next week and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> July 9-11. In Sunday's elections for the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> won 92 seats and eight were undecided and will be determined in runoff balloting. Opposition and independent candidates were allowed to run for only 161 seats in the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house, and they won 160. Only two of 35 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government candidates who ran unopposed on a `` national list'' received more than 50 percent of the vote, which was required for them to win the seats.

 Dozens of Americans fleeing <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> arrived Saturday with vivid stories of Chinese students carrying corpses in the street, vehicles on fire and frenzied attempts by foreigners to escape the military crackdown. `` We felt like refugees,'' said <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, who was on vacation with her mother, <PERSON> Sylvane </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> graduate student feared arrested following the bloody crackdown in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> capital arrived safely, his adviser said. `` Getting out of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was a fiasco,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of the People to People Ambassador Program upon his arrival at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` At the airport, there was a lot of chaos, a tremendous amount of confusion,'' the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> resident said. `` We were bumped off two flights.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flew three unscheduled charter flights from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Saturday, transferring passengers to regular flights out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Many apparently still felt a sense of urgency even after reaching <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Passengers pushed through gates, said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who piloted <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 38 from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine Americans who left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were listed on Flight 38, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Passenger <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Breitenbach </PERSON> was one of 40 <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, residents who traveled to <LOCATION> Baoding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, their community's sister city. The group arrived last Sunday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and saw students carrying corpses on stretchers and countless military vehicles on fire, <PERSON> Breitenbach </PERSON> said. `` We saw people breaking wood to make clubs,'' <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said. `` We were on the 15th floor of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, and saw four buses on fire last Saturday and litters of people in the street.'' `` It was the saddest thing I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durard </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and is with <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group of health professionals who bring their medical expertise to other countries. `` We saw people with little babies in their arms, asking the soldiers to leave them alone,'' <PERSON> Durard </PERSON> said. `` Our guide was a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> doctor and he was crying and crying.'' <PERSON> Durard </PERSON> said some People to People participants wore black ribbons to show their support for the students. `` There is hatred of the Chinese government everywhere,'' she said. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said that when the group was returning from a trip to the Great Wall, two lines of troops armed with rifles and bayonets surrounded their bus. The group `` hit the deck,'' he said. `` I did n't know what was going to happen.'' Group members made it back to the hotel safely, but were confined there. <PERSON> Breitenbach </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which has been criticized by some returnees, for doing a `` fantastic'' job evacuating Americans. Some members of her group have already returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and others waited to come home. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he taped passengers' cheers as his flight left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` When those wheels went up, it was great, but it was quite a tremendous emotional process,'' he said. `` We left behind some wonderful people. The government is just crushing them.'' Among the Chinese feared caught in the violence and the arrests that followed was Tong Boning, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> graduate student who took $ 8,000 in donations to pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 Authorities on Saturday began a nationwide political crackdown, announcing the arrests of more than 600 workers, students and other participants in the movement for democracy. Leaders of the student campaign in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and officials of independent labor unions in the capital and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> were in custody, the state-run news said. Other protest leaders were ordered to surrender themselves to police or face `` serious consquences.'' Scores of people also were arrested in the provincial capitals of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>. Disturbances broke out in all of these cities last week. The arrests came as authorities intensified a propaganda campaign that blamed `` troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries'' for confrontations last weekend in which the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of unarmed citizens in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The moves were further proof that hardliners, engaged in a power struggle with moderates, have gained control of the government. The re-emergence Friday of 84-year-old leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> with other aging revolutionaries served to bring the point home. On Saturday, troop trucks with loudspeakers drove through central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We love the people, we love the capital,'' they blared. Soldiers in the back of the truck trained their AK-47s on passers-by. Troops near the bustling Wangfujing intersection detained one youth who appeared to be a student. After searching his bags, a soldier pulled him to a military tent pitched nearby. Two other similar incidents were witnessed by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters. The evening television news reported the arrest of 26-year-old <PERSON> Gua </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON>, a history student from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>. The group led the seven weeks of pro-democracy protests that preceded last weekend's violence Authorities said <PERSON> Gua </PERSON>, who had extensive contacts with Western reporters, was arrested as he attempted to set fire to an armored personnel carrier. They said he and the labor leaders were being investigated for `` counterrevolutionary crimes,'' which carry a sentence of 15 years to death. The same news program broadcast footage from an American television report in which a middle-aged Chinese man told of soldiers gunning down scores of civilians in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. An announcer accused the man of `` rumor-mongering,'' a crime under martial law regulations in force in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and urged the audience to help in his arrest. Hotlines have been set up in every city district so citizens can inform on `` counterrevolutionaries.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Radio said city officials had received 167 `` important'' reports by Friday. A student leader, in an audio recording broadcast on the CBS Saturday Evening News, said that during the crackdown in Tienanmen Square tanks rolled over students and killed them while they slept in their tents. `` They thought, at most, that they would be carried away,'' said the woman, <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, through an interpreter. She said she was chief student commander in the square during the violence June 2-4. Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, meanwhile, ordered security forces to confront anyone found breaking the martial law regulations, in effect since May 20. `` Wherever these hoodlums are engaging in illegal activities, the police must battle them with the stern fist of the dictatorship of the people,'' he said. He also said that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> industries lost about $ 108 million during the first seven days of June. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> blamed traffic problems but wildcat strikes had been widespread. Chinese media said more than 400 `` scoundrels'' had been put in jail for burning military vehicles and beating soldiers during the army's invasion of the capital last weekend. On the television news, police were shown interrogating one man at gunpoint. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, about 200 students staged a sit-in to protest the arrest of nine labor leaders. The city government issued a warning saying there was `` a limit to the restraint of the people of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>.'' More than 150 people had been arrested there, official reports said. Foreigners and those Chinese who could continued their flight from the country. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> sent a convoy to nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> to evacuate 89 foreign tourists, students, scholars and oil technicians. Most were Americans. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasheng </PERSON>, an officer with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was among the Chinese who fled. `` The government has gone completely mad,'' he said before he arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` They are living centuries in the past and refuse to recognize that the world is changing. I wanted to help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but I see now that there is no hope.'' Chinese media criticized the Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks for their coverage of the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. And the first foreign reporter was expelled from the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> for reporting that 3,000 people had died and said the network's reports, widely popular in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, were aimed at `` instigating hatred and resistance.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the criticism. `` The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> checks its information prior to broadcast to be sure the facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newport </PERSON>, a correspondent from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was thrown out of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for `` acting in a way incompatible with his visa,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> ITN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. News Editor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said he did not know what type of visa <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> had. The campuses in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were mostly empty Saturday. Students who remained expressed shock at the violence of last weekend. `` I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put up with governments like these. It will take a long time to change.''

 A Chinese student leader on Saturday issued an account of the crackdown against student protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> a week ago, saying it was her responsibility to tell the truth being denied in government reports. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, who identified herself as the students' chief commander from June 2 to June 4, said in an audio recording broadcast on the CBS Evening News on Saturday that many students died and `` the executioners were the soldiers of the 27th Army.'' `` I think I'm the most qualified to talk about it, and it's my responsibility to tell everyone the truth,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> said through an interpreter. She denied official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government reports that only soldiers, not students, were killed in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> a week ago. Then she described the confrontation, saying many of the students did n't expect violence. `` Some students still had hopes in the government and in the soldiers. They thought, at most, that they would be carried away. They were tired and returned to their tents to sleep. `` Then the tanks made pancakes out of them. ... I do n't know the total -LRB- number of dead -RRB-, but the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, on the outside, they stood their ground. And now they're all dead. `` After students left the tanks and all their personnel carriers flattened the tents with the bodies inside. Then they poured gasoline over the remains and burned them,'' she said. Thousands of students, joined by workers and others, had virtually paralyzed Chinese government operations in Tiananmen Square for several weeks before soldiers took back the area on June 3. Estimates of the number of people killed range up to 3,000. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it had obtained the tape recording `` from a secret location.''

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, displaying the biting wit that enlivened her keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention last summer, announced Saturday she will run for governor. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy needs new leadership after a long downslide fueled by oil and real estate busts, Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> told about 1,000 supporters at the state Capitol. `` You know, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> used to say that any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said, quoting the powerful former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Today you and I become carpenters,'' she told the gathering, which was treated to lemonade, balloons and performances by Mexican mariachis, a church choir and the <ORGANIZATION> Waco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> band. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who would be the state's second woman governor elected in 66 years, said she wanted the job `` because I believe that it is time and because of all the things I've stood for all of my life.'' The last female governor, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, was elected in 1924. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> gained notoriety in her convention speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July when she attacked Republican policies saying, `` That dog wo n't hunt.'' The pithy state treasurer's declaration that then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born with a silver foot in his mouth prompted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to send her a silver foot pin, which Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' wore when the president addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> may get to ply her wit against another <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> businessman who is a probable <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor. Other possible <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders include Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rains </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> and oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. Asked about the possibility of facing the president's son as a candidate in the 1990 election, <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said, `` I have a primary to take care of ... One day at a time. One election at a time.'' The treasurer is expected to face <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> in a bitter fight for the Democratic nomination.

 The Observer newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, reported Sunday that six Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ five Americans and one Briton _ have been moved to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to ensure their safety. The weekly identified none of the Americans but said the Briton was television journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. Quoting unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, it said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and two of the Americans were disguised as injured Lebanese, transferred to the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> capital May 24 and flown to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The newspaper said three of the seven other Americans abducted by Iranian-backed Moslem extremists since 1985 were moved to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on May 29.

The newspaper said <PERSON> Mohtashami </PERSON> `` has powerful leverage with Lebanese kidnap gangs.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32, was snatched by gunmen as he headed to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after five weeks on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> assignment for London-based <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Saturday he plans to introduce legislation that would allow older Americans to earn more money while holding on to more of their Social Security earnings. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his bill would increase both the amount of earnings a Social Security retiree can have with no reduction in benefits, as well as reducing the rate of reduction for those who earn over the limit. Under his proposal, a person who earned $ 15,000 in additional income over their Social Security benefit would be allowed to retain almost $ 800 more in Social Security benefits than under the present law, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. Under the current Social Security earnings test, those 70 and older are eligible for full benefits without regard to earnings. But those under 70 are considered retired and eligible for full benefits only if their earnings are lower than a specified exemption level. In 1990, the maximum a retiree aged 65 to 69 could earn without suffering a reduction in Social Security benefits will be $ 9,360 under present law, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. He would boost that to $ 10,620. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that under his plan a person age 65 to 69, earning $ 15,000 and receiving $ 8,000 in Social Security benefits, would lose $ 1,095 in benefits next year, compared with $ 1,880 under existing law. Retirees now typically lose all benefits when they have earnings in excess of $ 34,000. Under the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> plan, a person with $ 8,000 in Social Security benefits would have to earn almost $ 36,000 before losing them all. Aides estimated that at least 600,000 Social Security beneficiaries would benefit from the changes proposed by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.

 About 500 people gathered Saturday at a memorial picnic for activist <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, but counter-demonstrators called the event a `` desecration'' of historical <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Crossing State Park. Among those at the picnic were Black Panther founder <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> and poet <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, who said he had tried to contact <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> about a week before the activist committed suicide April 12 in his apartment near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>. The poet, who said he knew <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was depressed because his mother was ill, recounted leaving a <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> saying on <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s answering machine: `` You will live or you will die Both are good.'' <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> read political poems dealing with the Iran-Contra scandal and environmental issues, then led the crowd in singing <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>'s song, `` You Are So Beautiful.'' <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> said the people who called <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> un-American and a dropout were wrong. `` He always said he never considered himself outside the -LRB- political -RRB- system,'' <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> said. `` His heart, mind and soul could be found in the first two paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>. Two groups staged counter-demonstrations at the park, saying a memoral service there for <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was a `` desecration'' of the soldiers buried near the park, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> crossed with his troops to surprise British soldiers during the battle of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> in 1776. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of those protesting the picnic, said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> `` did n't care about anything but <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> started the <PERSON> Yippie </PERSON> movement to protest the Vietnam War, then rose to prominence as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>, a group of radicals tried on charges of trying to disrupt the bloody Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1968. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, and his mother, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, traveled from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the gathering. `` He would have loved this,'' the younger <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` He would have loved this spirit of activism.'' The activist also would have appreciated the protesters, his brother said. `` He would have said that's what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s all about.'' The gathering was sponsored by the environmental group, Del-AWARE. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> had moved to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to protest the building of a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, and to protest the Point Pleasant pump near the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An 80-year-old man may have been too much in love with his wife of nearly 60 years, friends and neighbors said after police discovered the couple dead in a murder-suicide. Officials at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON> moved after suffering a stroke, called police when the 82-year-old woman did n't return from an outing with her husband, <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON>, Thursday night. Later that night, officers found the couple's bodies in the garage at their home in this city of about 18,000 people about halfway between <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON> had been shot once, and her husband hanged by a rope from the rafters. `` I look over there and I just ca n't believe it,'' said a neighbor of 30 years, who asked not to be identified by name. `` They were in love, really. They never did anything separately.'' Members of <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON>'s family visited him Sunday and noticed nothing amiss, except that he remained depressed about his wife's condition Nursing home employees also noticed nothing out of the ordinary when <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON> arrived Thursday to pick up his wife. `` It was just another visit,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, who works in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION>'s office. Mrs. <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON> moved into the nursing home last October when her husband could no longer care for her at home. The Rev. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kell </PERSON>, who knew the couple well, said the warning signs were present, but no one realized how serious they were. `` This man was sinking deeper and deeper into depression because of his wife's physical condition,'' said the Lutheran minister, the couple's pastor for the last 20 years. `` He just seemed to be the kind who withdrew inside of himself.'' `` He could n't say two words before he'd start crying,'' the neighbor of 30 years said. <PERSON> Kell </PERSON>, who had visited <LOCATION> Streblow </LOCATION> weekly in the past month, said the couple may have been too wrapped up in each other. He said friends, family and he and his co-pastors tried unsuccessfully to nudge <PERSON> Streblow </PERSON> out of his depression.

<TEXT>
 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and opposition groups signed an agreement Saturday for negotiations on a plan to provide for free elections next year and the transition to a multiparty system. `` This offers the hope of a way out of the dead-end Hungarian society and the hope that we may arrive at free elections which will open the way to a new democratic <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Toelgyessy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the opposition organizations. The negotiations are to begin Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building and be televised. The agreement, signed by representatives of 17 groups including the communists that are to take part in the negotiations, ended months of talks. Communist Party Secretary <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> called the agreement `` an important milestone.'' He told a news conference, `` We all agree that we want change. The competition among us involves who has better ideas, given that we all wish to avoid social destabilization.'' <PERSON> Toelgyessy </PERSON>, speaking at the same news conference, said, `` The talks are aimed solely at a peaceful transition to free elections which will then reveal the strenth of the various parties.'' Parliamentary elections are scheculed for mid-1990. The negotiations are to be three-sided. Nine opposition groups have formed an alliance called the Opposition Round Table. The two other participants will be the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a group of Communist-affiliated organizations. One section of the eight-page agreement states: `` The transition from a one-party system to a representative democracy and the creation of a constitutional state is realizable only through free elections.'' The document specifies that key legislation, such as a planned law on political parties and drafts of a new constitution, must be discussed in the negotiations before going to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition groups had insisted on that condition. The negotiations are to begin only three days before the reburial ceremony of the remains of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, premier during the 1956 revolt that was crushed by Soviet forces. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was arrested, convicted of crimes against the state and executed in 1958. His body was buried in an unmarked grave.

<TEXT>
 Contractors working for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> systematically embezzled millions of dollars the government should have received from homes sold after foreclosure, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. The newspaper said private escrow agents took the money with little fear of recrimination from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has been ordered by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to conduct investigations in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. `` There are several investigations and-or prosecutions around the country in which the loss to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> or the funds allegedly appropriated to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> exceed $ 1 million each,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, who is handling a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> case. In that case, an escrow agent, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, has been dubbed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' by federal investigators because she told agents that she diverted as much as $ 5.5 million to charity, the newspaper said. The federal investigation, the Times reported, is separate from a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into allegations that influence-peddling at the department allowed more than a dozen former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials to benefit from housing programs meant for the poor. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday reported that the head of the housing department's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office and three of her assistants were placed on administrative leave last week pending a review of charges that <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to buy 20 homes and 40 automobiles for the poor. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said senior <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated cost to the government by alleged mismanagement at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office at $ 10 million. `` This could never have gone on if they were doing their jobs right,'' <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> told the Times. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the inquiry has led to the indictment of <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, 36, who is accused of embezzling $ 2.5 million from the sale of 55 government-owned private homes in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area. The 79-count indictment against Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> accused her of trying to hide her activities by depositing sales proceeds in local banks in amounts less than $ 10,000 so that they would not be reported to the federal government. The homes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were sold over a four-month period last year and sold for between $ 15,000 to $ 80,000 each in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area including <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employs private escrow agents throughout the nation to handle paperwork and to transfer the money from the sales of private homes and other government properties to government accounts. The homes being sold by the government have been obtained because the owners default on their HUD-insured mortgages. After a home is resold, an escrow agent is supposed to transfer the money to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, minus a small commission, often between $ 50 to $ 200, the Times reported. In many instances, investigators told the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials failed to notice that the money from the sales was not transferred. One investigator told the Times: `` The laxity of oversight by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was frightening. Nobody noticed, nobody cared, that the money was n't coming in These private agents apparently felt after a while they had carte blanche to keep it.''

<TEXT>
 The No. 3 leader of the Maoist Shining Path movement was among 14 guerrillas killed by army units in a gun battle in the southern highlands, the government reported Saturday. It said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Orosco </PERSON>, known as Comrade Merino, and the other rebels were killed when they were trapped by an army unit in a district in <LOCATION> Apurimac </LOCATION> state 320 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The gunfight occurred Monday but information was delayed because of the remoteness of the area and checks to identify <PERSON> Orosco </PERSON> as among those slain, officials reported. Army intelligence sources said <PERSON> Orosco </PERSON> and a band of rebels used a a base camp near the Pampas river in <LOCATION> Apurimac </LOCATION> to launch attacks against targets in <LOCATION> Apurimac </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> states. The government made no mention of army casualties in the battle. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>, considered to be the Shining Path's No. 2 leader, was captured about a year ago in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. He is awaiting trial on charges of murder and terrorism. A tribunal of judges selected to try Morote, fearing attacks against them by Shining Path assassins, have asked for insurance policies worth $ 500,000 and special security measures. <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, a former professor of philosophy, is the Shining Path's main leader. The guerrilla group emerged in 1980 and nearly 15,000 people have been killed in its efforts to overthrow the government, according to official statistics.

He also defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to harbor <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, saying `` It's awful hard when a man presents himself, a person who is a dissident, and says his life is threatened, to turn him back.'' `` That is n't one of the premises on which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was founded,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added at the Thursday night news conference. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> is now enjoying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitality he was unable to claim last February when he was invited to be a guest of the president at dinner in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. On the final night of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hosted a Texas-style barbecue for Chinese leaders in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotel. But <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who has spoken out repeatedly against human-rights abuses in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was barred from attending by Chinese police. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s protests did not come until the next day, amid some foot shuffling by the administration over who actually invited the dissident to the U.S.-hosted event _ the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> or the embassy staff. The president's slowness of response in the incident and his failure to stress the human rights issue _ either in public speeches or in private meetings with Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> _ drew criticism from some quarters. It also evoked comparisons with his predecessor, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who often used public forums in communist countries to speak out forcefully on human rights. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in part, played down the issue during his visit so as not to offend top Chinese officials. He has a personal relationship with many of them. And he also has cited his familiarity with the Chinese sensitivity to criticism from outside on internal matters. However, any constraints <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may previously have felt about denouncing human-rights abuses in clear terms were washed away with the bloodshed of the past week in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. His spokesman said Friday, `` Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its citizens. We have had an incredible upheaval in -LRB- that -RRB- country.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added, `` Things are not going back to normal soon or in a quick fashion. ... A situation has been put in effect in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that is going to have an influence on that country and on their relations with all countries of the world for a considerable period of time.'' As for the president, the personal relationships he established with senior Chinese leaders over the years since he served there as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy in 1974-75 have been of little use to him in the current crisis. As he told his news conference, he put in a call to Chinese leaders but the line was busy. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Friday disclosed that the leader <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been trying to reach was <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> himself. `` We were just informed the call would not go through,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The call remains in place ... and of course, now it's public. I'm sure Chinese officials have read about it and so forth,'' the spokesman added.

 Former Interior Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> denies he used his relationship with former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleague <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to sway the selection of federally subsidized housing projects for developers who paid him as a consultant. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> said Friday he `` never asked Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to do anything that would embarrass him or me,'' during meetings with the then-housing secretary in connection with a project to renovate a low-income <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> housing development. `` I left his office with no commitments from him other than that he would check into it,'' said <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, adding that his conduct was `` moral, ethical and effective.'' The project was later financed under the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. The program came under congressional scrutiny in April when current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended funding and criticized it as being riddled with `` favoritism, mismanagement and influence-peddling.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s action followed release of an inspector general's investigative audit which revealed several former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and other government officials had assisted public housing authorities and developers in obtaining grants to renovate or repair subsidized housing for low-income families <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has restored 1989 funding for the program and issued new guidelines on June 1. `` While in government, Mr. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> often belittled federal programs to assist the poor and the less fortunate. He spoke of the dangers of being ` lured by the crumbs of subsidies, entitlements and giveaways,''' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., in opening Friday's hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on housing and Yet <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> `` apparently decided to take advantage'' of them, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. His subcommittee is one of several congressional panels investigating the program. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> described a `` fee sharing arrangement'' with <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a group headed by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former special assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> were paid $ 300,000 as consultants to developer <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Landex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on a project to renovate 312 units at the Kingsley Park Apartments in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, Md. `` This project came into existence because of influence-peddling by you,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> charged. `` A much more worthy project may not have come into existence because they did n't have the good fortune to hire you.'' `` The fact remains you were able to do something because of your prior Cabinet relationship with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D - <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in a sometimes rancorous exchange with <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> `` People had to pay to get influence on their behalf,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` I'm the messenger ... You do n't need to bad-mouth the messenger,'' <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> retorted. `` You're much more than a messenger,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> replied. `` You are a great critic of the established ways ... but when the chance to make $ 169,000 came your way, that did not seem to motivate you.'' The balance of $ 131,000 went to <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> also testified he received $ 20,000 and $ 100,000 in consultant fees from similar arrangements with the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> group on projects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> said he met on two occasions with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in early 1985 in connection with the projects and had several conversations with three other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a special assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBartolomeis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>, who both served as assistant secretary for housing during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> resigned as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interior secretary in October 1983. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is the sole <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary to remain with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> through both his terms as president. However, <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> said he was not aware when he met with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had set up a three-person panel in the department, including <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, to select projects for mod rehab funding. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and DeBartolomeis are scheduled to testified before <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>' panel next week

<HEAD>GAO: Not Enough Job Training Money Goes to Those in Need</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's main job-training program is providing more services to people who already have skills while shortchanging those who need training the most, federal auditors conclude in the latest report critical of the program. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also said Friday in a report that too little attention is paid to remedial education needs of high school dropouts in the system set up under the Job Training Partnership Act. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> questioned <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> programs that pay for on-the-job training for low-skill positions, saying in most cases it appears the government is paying wage subsidies to employers who are shirking their responsibilities to provide worthwhile training. `` JTPA has not targeted those with the greatest need for employment and training services,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The less job-ready were receiving services that were less intensive than those provided to the more job-ready.'' Still, the agency said the Job Training Partnership Act was proving far more effective than previous federal training programs. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, requested by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reviewed services provided by 63 of the 600 regional `` service delivery areas'' set up under the 1983 legislation sponsored by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. More than $ 10 billion has been spent on the system in the past six years. The agency's findings were similar to those reached by an advisory committee that monitors the act and by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, led by Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., which held extensive hearings last year Both <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration have proposed amending the program, and their proposals appear to answer most of the recent criticisms, which focus largely on a failure of programs to target those most in need of training and a failure to shape programs to individual needs. Among the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s principal findings were: _ Those most needing extensive skill training were least likely to get it _ Some 37 percent of those eligible for Job Training Partnership Act programs are high school dropouts but only 27 percent of the participants are dropouts _ The system's programs currently serve roughly equal proportions of clients who are `` job ready'' and who need extensive skills training `` This suggests that, nationwide, the program is not targeting services,'' the study said. _ About 43 percent of on-the-job training contracts were for lower skills occupations such as custodians and dishwashers `` In many instances, on-the-job training contracts appeared to provide wage subsides to employers,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` While such training may be appropriate for certain individuals, much of it appeared to be excessively long.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations matched many of those suggested by the administration, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee, including that spending formulas be rewritten to emphasize training for those most in need of skills. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> expanded on those suggestions by saying more extensive training for promising occupations also should be a major goal. The congressional agency acknowledged such an approach likely would reduce the number of people served by the federal program, which now provides services to just 6 percent of the eligible population. `` Because more intensive training services are more costly, fewer people are likely to be served under <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> if such services are offered to each participant,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Included in the amendments being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a requirement that the Job Training Partnership Act system coordinate its programs with other federal, state and local education and welfare programs.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Americans appear to have fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the past week, spurred by the savage crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and the advice of Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens should depart. According to figures released Friday by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, slightly more than 1,500 Americans remained in the nation of 1 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had estimated that about 8,800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were in the country prior to last week's violence in which hundreds of demonstrators were killed by Chinese troops. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> described <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as `` still an armed camp.'' The White House on Friday denounced the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's call for reprisals against the demonstrators and stressed that authorities there had `` murdered many, many of its citizens.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who placed a call to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> earlier in the week but was unable to get through, had not heard back from <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> by Friday evening. `` The phone call remains placed and we'll see if he returns our call,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. An administration source familiar with intelligence estimates said the number of Chinese troops in and around the capital city had grown to about 340,000 from 200,000 estimated earlier in the week. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> appeared in public Friday for the first time since May 16 to attend a ceremony at which he saluted military leaders for carrying out the crackdown on the `` counter-revolutionaries'' who had occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square until last weekend's military assault. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s reappearance did not settle the question of who is in charge in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, nor does it clarify who bears responsibility for ordering the crackdown. `` We think that it's a very clouded situation, and we are n't in a situation to judge at this time to see who is in charge of what,'' she said. `` To be perfectly honest ... it seems to me that that would be something the Chinese should be telling us, versus us trying to sit back and guess.'' Said Fitzwater: `` You can watch television and see who the government is, but in terms of individual actions and motivations ... we do n't know.'' But he added that `` I do n't think anyone doubts'' that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> are now in charge of the overall government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> used some of the strongest language yet to express <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condemnation of the military actions against unarmed civilians. `` Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its citizens,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` Things are not going back to normal soon or in a quick fashion.'' He noted calls for reprisals were being announced over the loudspeakers in the public squares in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Reprisals are repugnant. We certainly watch this situation with grave concern,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suspended military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Monday but has refrained from economic sanctions, saying he does not want to cause hardship for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Friday there are approximately 500 Americans left in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, including 150 to 200 journalists and 116 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy personnel. The remainder are business people and tourists, she said. Between 50 and 100 Amercians are in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and the embassy has organized a bus caravan to return them to the capital, the spokeswoman said. She said 10 dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel are left in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and will be leaving soon, and no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students remain at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the rallying points of the pro-democracy movement.

 Internal divisions among Palestinians and Israelis have been magnified by 18 months of bloodshed in the occupied lands and threaten to paralyze peace efforts. Leaders on both sides predict that, unless political progress is made soon, the violence will grow and destroy a historic opportunity for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. `` We are at a turning point, either to get a political solution or resort to more violence,'' said <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> businessman who supports the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are waiting to see if we can reap all that we have planted in the past 18 months.'' At least 512 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,000 wounded in the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which began its 19th month Friday. Twenty-two Israelis have been slain. Both societies have been polarized and advocates of violence are becoming more active. Palestinian militants insist only a violent struggle can lead to their own independent state. `` We are exposed to a lot of pressure to resort to violent means,'' <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is growing mainly among the lower cadres of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the population because the Israelis are pushing us so much against the wall.'' On the Israeli side, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> speaks of harsher measures to crush the uprising and Jewish settlers are attacking Palestinian villages. A 13-year-old girl was killed in a recent raid. Leftists, by contrast, grow more vocal in demands for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and formation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, both taboo in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Oz </PERSON>, a prominent leftist writer, said extremism, including vigilante attacks by settlers, could destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want the nation to be ripped apart, but under no circumstances will we acquiesce in the transformation of our country into a monster,'' he told an audience of peace activists. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview: `` If both sides lose control completely, the situation can deteriorate and we can have more violence.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> faces increasing pressure in his conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to abandon plans for elections in the occupied lands that would choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said he will resign if <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects the plan at its convention next month. Mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials have conditionally accepted the elections as a first step toward negotiating a permanent settlement, but militants reject any compromise. `` I think only the continuation of the uprising will bring us liberation,'' said <PERSON> Sufian </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> physician whose views have been linked to those of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical pro-Syrian faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only obstacles are the compromises the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership is making,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must focus its efforts only on the uprising and its continuation.'' Moderates say the uprising is a means of forcing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it defines as a terrorist organization. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will find no alternative but to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a moderate from Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will be forced to approach us as a people with a leadership and rights.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a close aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not bow to violence and would crush the rebellion. `` The Arabs have two alternatives: to continue with the uprising or enter the circle of peace,'' he said. `` They will achieve nothing through the uprising.'' <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said: `` If they reject elections, I do n't see in the future any plan that will pull us out of the circle of violence.''

<TEXT>
 The first meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> quickly became an outlet for a national catharsis, with representatives of the Soviet people pouring out anger and grievances pent up for generations Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tolerant hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been purging Soviet society of its devils, re-examining history from the rostrum and demanding answers no one dared demand before in public. Just a year ago, at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, observers were surprised by the candid criticism from little-known delegates and frank arguments between senior party officials, some of which were even shown on television. But from the opening moments of this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has been broadcast live to a rapt nation except for two private sessions, the horizons stretched again. This debate has been broader and more pointed than anything seen in a public forum in this country in living memory. `` Each one of us wants to talk out an ocean of emotion,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON>. The result has been a tidal wave of words. Day after day for nearly two weeks, the people's representatives _ most of them chosen in competitive elections _ have talked openly, sometimes heatedly, sometimes even shouting, and their voices are heard throughout the land. Some of the criticism has been by deputies playing to their constituents: complaints about the miserable roads in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the disappearance of refrigerators, the poor health care. On occasion, the talk has even been personal. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, who remains largely off limits to the increasingly frank official press, was compared by one deputy to <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, `` who, fearing neither bullets nor death, led the nation to victory but who, owing to sycophants and his wife, transformed the republic into an empire.'' `` You can put me to death, but I fear this path,'' said <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhov </PERSON>, a driver from <LOCATION> Kharkov </LOCATION>, who promised the president his vote but warned: `` You, too, are incapable of avoiding the adulation and influence of your wife.'' `` Never before in history,'' he said, `` have the rich and the poor sat at the same table, the former eating chicken, the latter licking their own fingers. What kind of perestroika is this?'' But deputies also have challenged the historical tenets on which the union of the 15 Soviet socialist republics is based and have demanded the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> surrender its legal monopoly on power. Until now, the sanctity of the union and one-party rule were not open to question. `` Up to now, in our history books, we have said <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> voluntarily joined the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that it was a popular revolution, there was no violence, and it was a declaration of free will,'' said historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>. `` This is a lie.'' Lithuanian prosecutor <PERSON> Egidius </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bichkauskas </PERSON> charged the three independent Baltic states actually were handed to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the Soviets and the Germans secretly carved up the lands that lay between them in 1939. `` As a result of this pact, sovereign <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the other Baltic republics were occupied and incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, losing their independent statehood,'' Bichkauskas noted. Soviets have been taught the three republics overthrew their fascist rulers in popular uprisings in 1940, and were then occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and liberated by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the war. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he could hardly believe the revisionists' account, but he agreed to a congressional investigation to determine the truth. <PERSON> Tamaz </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamkrelidze </PERSON>, a university professor, demanded the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> condemn the `` annexation of the independent democratic Georgian republic'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1921, saying it violated a 1920 treaty agreed to by Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not act on his complaint, but <PERSON> Gamkrelidze </PERSON> gained a national forum for a long-suppressed view. The inquisitive spirit of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has proved contagious. After the first week of debate, an official newspaper exposed the government's 27-year cover-up of how soldiers opened fire on strikers in the southern <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Novocherkassk </LOCATION>, secretly buried the bodies of 20 victims and repaved the street to hide the blood. The account published by <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper of the Communist youth league, was accompanied by a commentary signed by three <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deputies, saying it was fitting to report details of the long-secret affair during the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' first session.

<HEAD>Court Orders Agency to Reconsider Formaldehyde Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal court has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a new review of the cancer risks of exposure to formaldehyde and also to reconsider its decision not to protect the earnings of workers disabled by the gas. In a decision issued Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` has failed adequately to explain'' its determination that the exposure limit for formaldehyde it set in 1987 made the cancer risk insignificant. The court also said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had offered a `` feeble'' explanation of its decision not to include in its standard for formaldehyde exposure provisions guaranteeing workers will be paid full wages and retain seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illness linked to the substance. The court, ruling in a suit filed by several unions, upheld <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to require employers to provide annual medical examinations to workers who are exposed to formaldehyde, a colorless gas that when mixed with other materials has a number of applications in industry and is found in numerous construction and consumer products. Simple monitoring of employees who are exposed to the substance and medical checkups if they develop skin or eye irritations and other symptoms caused by formaldehyde exposure are enough to protect workers, the court said. Also upheld was the OSHA-set exposure `` action level'' at which employers are required to provide workers with training, protective clothing and other measures for protection. The unions failed to show that lowering that level would significantly enhance worker safety, the court said. An <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said agency officials were reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, revising a 1972 standard, in 1987 set a maximum permissible exposure level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during an eight-hour workday and set the action level at 0.5 ppm. A number of unions challenged the standard, saying <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> should have set a far more stringent exposure limit. The court, in returning to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the question of cancer risk, questioned the formula used by the department to extrapolate the cancer risk to humans from the risk found in animal studies. The court also dismissed <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that it did not include provisions protecting the earnings and seniority of workers disabled by formaldehyde because it did not believe those workers could ever return to their old jobs. The court said in other instances the agency had provided earnings protection until a disabled worker was retrained for another job, citing provisions applying to coal dust and lead exposure. When it released the revised standard in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it would help protect 2.2 million workers at an annual cost to industry of more than $ 60 million. Employers who can not reduce formaldehyde to acceptable levels in the air have to provide respirators to workers.

<HEAD>Witnesses Differ on Effects of Bill Reducing Home Down Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home builders told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a bill lowering the minimum down payment on government-backed home loans would ease the nation's housing crisis, but a grass-roots group said it would actually make homes less affordable. `` The greatest impediment to homeownership is excessive monthly housing costs,'' not the down payment, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. In 12 years, she said, average costs for first-time buyers have soared from less than one-quarter of their income to more than one-third. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, cited a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study that reached a different conclusion. `` Raising the cash necessary for a down payment is the greatest obstacle to homeownership for first-time buyers,'' she quoted the study as saying. That study concluded that 81 percent of potential first-time buyers _ identified as renters between the ages of 25 and 34 _ do n't have the money to make a 20 percent down payment on a median-price starter home, which cost about $ 69,000 in 1986, she said. The two housing experts were among several taking part in a hearing on a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, and 40 other senators <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he expects the bill, aimed at making housing available to more Americans, to be approved by the committee next month although it likely will be sometime next year before it can clear <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would: _ Lower the 5 percent minimum down payment on FHA-insured mortgages for most first home buyers to 3 percent For all <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loans, the down payment would be cut to 3 percent of the first $ 50,000 of value -LRB- up from $ 25,000 -RRB- and 5 percent of the balance. _ Permit <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> to insure loans for homes worth up to 95 percent of local median sales prices, which would be as high as $ 180,000 in high-cost areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> The current limit is $ 101,250. _ Allow owners of <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Account </ORGANIZATION> and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- retirement plans to withdraw money from those accounts to buy a home <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perel </PERSON>, housing finance officer for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> provision is highly desirable, although he predicted it would be of little benefit to younger families looking for their first home. <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON>, whose organization is a national coalition of grass-roots community-action groups, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> proposal would not be equitable because it would represent a federal housing subsidy only to those fortunate enough to have a retirement account. And in case of a foreclosure, she said, such home buyers could face `` a double whammy: losing their home and their life savings in one stroke.'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed most parts of the <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> bill. `` These enhancements to <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> can be the cornerstone of the federal government's effort to expand homeownership opportunities,'' he said.

 A federal prosecutor whose sister was jailed for not revealing the whereabouts of her daughter has defied a judge by refusing to answer 26 questions about the child.

The custody battle between Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, who adamantly denies abusing the child and contends Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> is insane, has been going on almost since the girl's birth in 1983.

Warned by <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> that he faced contempt charges, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, `` My answer is the same.'' Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> also testified, repeating her contention that she would remain in jail for the rest of her life rather than produce the child.

<HEAD>Hopes are High for `Magic Bullet' Drug to Treat AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The experimental drug CD4 is the nearest thing to a `` magic bullet'' that might one day be used to treat AIDS, according to one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus. `` If CD4 does n't work in the early phases, do n't despair,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Friday at the close of the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said CD4 blocks the mechanism where the AIDS virus attaches to certain white blood cells and infects them. This mechanism is so critical to AIDS virus growth in the body that some version of CD4 ought to be able to interfere with it, he said. He also reported that mice given a single AIDS virus gene developed an AIDS-related cancer called <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, suggesting the cancer is caused by the virus itself. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s studies on <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma offer one possible explanation for the origin of the disease in AIDS patients. Others have evidence indicating <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma may be caused by another virus, not the AIDS virus, but <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s work questions that theory. His report dealt with a study involving <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma developed in mice that were genetically engineered to contain an AIDS virus gene called tat. The tat gene is a kind of supercharger that speeds up the replication of the AIDS virus. Mice carrying the tat gene developed <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, but the cancer did not arise in the cells carrying the gene, according to the study, but arose from other cells. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said that finding suggests the gene triggers the production of some biochemical factor that in turn causes the cancer. He also said certain <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma cells called spindle cells are releasing `` a whole series of biological molecules that allow us to create KS -LRB- <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma -RRB- in a mouse.'' If the work proves correct, it offers the possibility that drugs could be designed to interfere with these molecules and treat or prevent <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. The AIDS virus infects certain white blood cells called T4 cells, or CD4 cells. These are master players in the immune system, directing many immune functions. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said other viruses that activate the immune system _ and therefore T4 cells _ can aggravate infection with the AIDS virus, known as the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. For example, a leukemia-causing virus called HTLV-1 can infect the same cells infected with HIV and can `` turn on'' HIV in the cells, resulting in the production of more HIV, he said. Human herpes virus type 6, or HHV-6, which was discovered recently by <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> and his colleagues, can also infect the same cells and turn on HIV, he said. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> described what he said was a possible vicious cycle in which HHV-6 and HIV work together to cause disease. `` All of us in this room almost have HHV-6,'' he said. Healthy people control it and it causes no illness but HIV weakens the immune system allowing HHV-6 to grow. The proliferating HHV-6 then triggers the production of HIV, according to the study, and the HIV further weakens the immune system, allowing further growth of HHV-6 in a continuing cycle.

The proposal is expected to be part of a far-reaching rewrite of the 1970 Clean Air Act that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will unveil Monday. He was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, putting finishing touches on the package. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide _ emitted mainly by coal-fired power plants and identified as a main ingredient in forming acid rain _ is not quite as tough as the 12-million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists. But it was far stronger than utilities and other coal-burning industries have advocated _ and represents a dramatic turnabout from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration's resistence to any new standards for controlling acid rain.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> made concessions in his tour of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pilgrim in the lands of Luther failed to excite a public already indifferent to its own church. From the fjords of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, to barren windswept <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> to the high-tech affluence of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s tour was unlike any of his previous trips to Christian countries, even those like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> are a minority. Faced with some reluctance to the visit by <PERSON> Lutheran </PERSON> clergy, the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics agreed to sit in silence in a Lutheran cathedral in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, referred to himself often as the `` bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'' rather than as <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and listened to chiding by Lutheran bishops. Even to his own flock, in a region with marked differences on sexual morality with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s teaching, he used more cautious language than usual when dealing with family issues.

 The experimental drug CD4 is the nearest thing to a `` magic bullet'' that might one day be used to treat AIDS, according to one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus. `` If CD4 does n't work in the early phases, do n't despair,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Friday at the close of the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said CD4 blocks the mechanism where the AIDS virus attaches to certain white blood cells and infects them. This mechanism is so critical to AIDS virus growth in the body that some version of CD4 ought to be able to interfere with it, he said. He also reported that mice given a single AIDS virus gene developed an AIDS-related cancer called <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, suggesting the cancer is caused by the virus itself.

 For years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews have set aside a special matzo each Passover and prayed for the emigration of their brethren in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now that those prayers have been answered for many, Jews in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are being asked to set aside something more than unleavened bread _ the money required to resettle as many as 50,000 Jews who are expected to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year. The United Jewish Appeal, the national fund-raising campaign for Jewish causes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has launched Passage to Freedom, an effort aimed at raising $ 75 million for Soviet emigres this year. Half will go to resettlement activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rest will be split between Soviet Jews in transit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and those seeking to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Students whose stubborn calls for democracy brought a military crackdown that left hundreds dead said Saturday they were still trying to understand what happened and ride out a campaign of political repression. `` I'm just trying to leave the country,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student said gloomily. `` For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put up with governments like this. It will take a long time to change.'' The mood of confusion and frustration on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> college campuses contrasted sharply with the spirit one week ago, when most students were confident the government would have to bend to their demand for dialogue. Then came last weekend's military assault on student protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in which nearly 300 people were killed by official count and as many as 3,000 by unofficial count.

 In 1982, a homosexual man with AIDS had a 30 percent chance of living for 18 months. In 1987, he had a 60 percent chance of living that long. In 1982, doctors had only a vague idea of how AIDS was spreading and no idea what was causing it. Today they know its cause, they have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study. `` None of us can be satisfied until no patient dies of AIDS, but there is some progress,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a principal developer of the drug AZT, the only one so far approved to treat AIDS.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Saturday announced plans to abolish 18 state agencies, slash the number of Cabinet posts, and surrender some power to the republics in the biggest government overhaul of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been streamlining and decentralizing the Soviet bureaucracy because he blames it for impeding his economic reforms. The Cabinet, or <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> _ which <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> heads _ has been widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes. Speaking to a joint session of the nation's new two-chamber legislature, the Supreme Soviet, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said of the 100 Cabinet members appointed in 1984, only 10 will remain. He also told the session, broadcast live on state-run radio and television, that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries, construction, transport, agriculture and defense, only 32 would remain.

Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, 18, became a center of controversy in April when an article about her for the school paper was killed by <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The article, titled `` Against all odds ... Student becomes valedictorian despite motherhood,'' detailed Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s first pregnancy, and how she was shuffled among relatives after her mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the school newpaper article was too personal.
