 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s top federal prosecutor announced Friday he would not file criminal charges against <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> after a 2 -LCB- - year investigation, but he hinted broadly that corruption persists in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Outgoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, as one of his last official acts, told a crowded news conference that he had decided not to indict <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> or his associate, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON>, who was accused of extortion in a development project. `` There is simply not sufficient evidence to ask a grand jury to indict either of these two individuals for violation of the federal extortion statute or the federal tax laws,'' <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. After a two-month review of a 2 -LCB- - year-long federal investigation, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said the final decision was `` not a close call'' based on the admissible evidence in the exhaustively researched case The review had been ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. But in reply to reporters' questions, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> indicated his personal belief that the development business is rife with tactics that are questionable, although not indictable. `` Power-brokering is not necessarily a federal crime,'' he said. At another point, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said the tactics involve `` influence-peddling.'' The decision by <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> helps lift a cloud of suspicion from <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, one of the state's most powerful politicians, who was rocked by allegations made by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> landlord and developer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in a civil suit. In a civil suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON>, a long-time associate and law partner of <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, extorted $ 500,000 from him by suggesting that he could hamper governmental approval of an office building development in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> unless he was cut in on the deal. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> of benefiting from the pay-off. <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON> denounced those allegations, but <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> has largely refrained from defending himself in public. An aide said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president would make no comment on the prosecutor's decision not to press charges <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to bribing a City Hall official to expedite another of his projects, was apparently the government's key witness in the case. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> may have sincerely believed <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON> was trying to extort him, but the prosecutor said the criminal issue was <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON>'s actions _ not <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s perceptions.

<HEAD>Farmers Plan to Grow More Corn, Soybeans, Most Other Crops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey shows that farmers intend to boost corn plantings this spring, with easier federal curbs and higher market prices helping them bounce back from last year's drought. The survey, announced on Friday, showed that farmers intend to plant 73.3 million acres to corn, up 8 percent from last year. Soybean plantings are expected to rise 5 percent from 1988 to 61.7 million acres. Officials said the report was based on an annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> survey of about 65,000 farmers in early March. Increases from last year were also indicated for grain sorghum, wheat _ including winter, durum and other spring varieties _ tobacco, dry edible beans and sweet potatoes. Farmers indicated they would plant fewer acres this year of oats, hay, cotton, rice and peanuts. If farmers follow through with their plans, the corn acreage would be the most since 76.7 million acres were planted for the 1986 crop. In 1985, plantings reached 83.4 million acres. The planted corn acreage dropped to 60.2 million acres in 1983, another year of severe drought. Last year, of the 67.6 million acres planted, 58.1 million were harvested for grain, yielding 4.92 billion bushels, down 30 percent from the 1987 crop. Average yields dropped to 84.6 bushels per acre from a record of 119.4 bushels in 1987. There was no indication of 1988 production in the report. Winter wheat output will be indicated by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for the first time on May 11 and corn figures in August, along with soybeans, cotton and other spring-planted crops. Total wheat plantings for this year's harvest was indicated at 74.3 million acres, up by more than 13 percent from last year. Winter wheat was reported at 54.7 million acres, up 12 per cent; durum, 3.86 million, up 16 percent; and other spring-planted wheat, 15.7 million acres, up 17 percent. Officials cautioned that the actual acreage planted by farmers this spring `` may vary from intentions because of the effects of weather, availability of production inputs, changes in market conditions prior to planting'' and the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report itself. With production cut by last year's drought, market prices of grains and soybeans rose sharply. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also relaxed acreage-reduction requirements under wheat and feed grains programs for 1989. Preliminary price figures for March showed on Thursday that the average farm price of wheat was $ 4.16 per bushel, up from $ 2.74 a year ago. Corn was reported at $ 2.61 against $ 1.86 in March 1988, and soybeans were $ 7.57 per bushel, compared with $ 6.05 a year earlier. Other crops included in the survey report: _ Cotton plantings, 11 million acres, down 12 percent from 1988 _ Sorghum, 11.8 million acres, up 14 percent _ Barley, 9.62 million acres, down 1 percent _ Oats, 13.2 million acres, down 5 percent _ Hay, 63.1 million acres, down 4 percent _ Rice, 2.86 million acres, down 2 percent _ Peanuts, 1.64 million acres, down 1 percent _ Tobacco, 713,000 acres, up 13 percent _ Dry edible beans, 1.67 million acres, up 11 percent _ Sweet potatoes, 94,000 acres, up 2 percent

 Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense that he carried out administration orders by covering up his work for the Nicaraguan Contras was crippled when a federal judge refused to compel former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to testify In denying a request to call <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a defense witness in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Friday he could n't find any evidence that the former president authorized <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities. `` The trial record presently contains no proof that defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON> ever received any authorization from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wrote in a five-page order. `` Nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where he now lives, said Friday he had been determined to fight any attempts to force him to testify. `` I made up my mind I was n't going,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told KESQ-TV. `` I think it would have set a precedent that the next president does n't have a right to impose on other presidents No president has ever been subpoenaed.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have been the first former president to be compelled to testify in a criminal proceeding concerning his conduct while in office had <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> agreed to make him appear. The defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case Monday, the seventh week of North's trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> refused to identify the first witness. The prosecution had put on 29 witnesses, and on Friday the judge denied a defense motion to dismiss remaining counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The defense argues that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was simply following <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s orders when he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in helping the Nicaraguan Contras North's attorneys had subpoenaed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so they could ask him what he knew about the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s role in raising money for the Contras at a time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had barred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the rebels. The 12-count indictment against <PERSON> North </PERSON> accuses him of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and making false statements in connection with letters he drafted and a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee members. The judge said he reached his decision about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s testimony after studying the trial record, thousands of pages of classified and unclassified documents, portions of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal diaries and written answers <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> provided to the grand jury. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said no presidential privilege prevented him from ordering the former president to testify, but the defense failed to prove <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s testimony was crucial to provide North a fair trial. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal attorney, said he was pleased with the order. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> declined comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s court appearance on the grounds it could have opened the door for questioning about sensitive national security matters. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> acknowledged there is `` understandable public interest'' in what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` may have known or may have done.'' But he said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial does not involve such a broad inquiry. He noted that three conspiracy charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> involving presidential matters had been dropped. North also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in travelers checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is diverting $ 5 million from AIDS research, prevention and education programs so states can continue providing the costly drug AZT to AIDS patients who can not afford it. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the action Friday, hours before the federal AZT program expired, was in response to a request from Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and other senators But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that while he agreed with the `` compassionate purpose'' of the transfer, `` a series of ` one-time' appropriations is not the most desirable way to address the issue of support for purchase'' of AIDS drugs. The funds, which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said are being diverted from AIDS research, prevention and education, should continue the program for six months. The administration says federal support for AIDS research, prevention and treatment will exceed $ 2.1 billion this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Nearly 7,000 of the estimated 30,000 AIDS victims using AZT are receiving the drug under the program, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and extended for six months last September. The drug, which has been shown to extend the lives of many AIDS patients, costs about $ 8,000 a year when taken at full dosage. It is currently the only drug approved by the government to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who spearheaded the drive to continue the temporary grants for state AZT programs, commended <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` for recognizing the urgency of the situation and moving so quickly to avert a gap in this lifesaving program.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> had already run out of federal funds allocated to them under the program and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> were due to run out Friday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, an AIDS patient advocacy group. Programs in other states _ including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which account for about one-third of all those in the program _ were due to run out of federal funds by the end of June. Other states have enough money to last through August. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said that, `` while we do n't want to see the money come from already existing AIDS efforts, we believe the financial crisis faced by so many people with AIDS is urgent enough to warrant such measures.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had tried to get a bill to extend the program through September approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, before lawmakers left for the Easter recess, but the measure was blocked in a parliamentary move. In a letter Tuesday, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and 11 other senators called on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to transfer $ 5 million in AIDS funds to the AZT program. They said <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> had been authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in September to redirect $ 15 million to the program, but had provided only $ 10 million. They said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had intended that the entire amount be redirected. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to extend the program last September, giving final approval only hours before the program was to expire, the manufacturer of AZT, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to provide $ 5 million worth of the drug free. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> plans to introduce legislation this year that would address the issue of care for AIDS patients and `` end the haphazard Band-Aid approach to provision'' of drugs such as AZT to patients, a <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide said. Medicaid covers about 40 percent of people with AIDS and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> covers about 3 percent, but many low-income people with AIDS do n't qualify for either program, according to the Human Rights Campaign Fund. Also, many private health insurance plans do n't cover the drug or do n't cover its entire cost, the group said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is being forced to review its policy of favoring minorities in the sale of `` distressed'' radio and TV stations because a court says the program is unconstitutional. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s 1978 `` distress sale'' rules, which allow quick sales at reduced rates of defunct or disenfranchised stations to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities, violate the equal protection provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, a federal appeals court said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, in a 2-1 vote, overturned a purchase after a <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, broadcaster said he should have been able to try to buy a station being offered in a distress sale. The ruling is at odds with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which in December 1987 refused _ with then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concurring _ to allow the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to consider changing the policy. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had said it wanted to review the policy after the appeals court in 1986 rejected a sale based on the agency's `` comparative preference'' program of giving special treatment to women seeking FM station licenses But after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-0 in February 1988 to reaffirm the distress sale and female preference policies. It was not clear Friday how the commission would react to the latest remand. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said she strongly supported minority entry into broadcasting and that the court had struck down a program mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are now between the proverbial rock and a hard place,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> also said he supported ensuring minority participation in broadcasting, but also that `` race alone should not control the licensing of broadcast stations.'' The Media Access Center, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> policy had worked well and the court `` made a mistake.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, the center's executive director, said `` we expect that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will reinstate the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 denied <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shurberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> a chance to compete for the purchase of WHCT-TV in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> from the station's owner. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also affirmed that a rival for the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> station, <ORGANIZATION> Astroline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, was a minority enterprise and not a sham, as <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON> contended. The appeals court Friday said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> policy did not meet previous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> tests of minority set-aside programs, including one that preferences be given to minorities only after race-neutral efforts to increase minority ownership had failed. `` The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination ... and it provides no procedures for ensuring that the policy's beneficiaries have actually suffered from the effects of past discrimination,'' Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> said in the majority opinion. Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> dissented, saying the distress sale policy legally worked to ensure diversity in programming and ownership and that it was `` narrowly tailored to address the critical entry barriers to minority participation in media ownership while imposing only minimal burdens on innocent third parties.'' <PERSON> Shurberg </PERSON>, speaking by phone from <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, said he was `` delighted'' with the court's ruling.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, on his first visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on Sunday, may seek to defuse conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and tell <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is weary of financing <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> adventurism. Both Soviet and Western analysts interviewed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> predict the reformist Soviet leader will be outwardly friendly toward the doctrinaire <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> president. But they expect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to use the island as a platform for a major speech signaling his desire for a peaceful settlement of regional strife. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to use his influence with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to further peace efforts. `` We would like to see the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdraw their resources and support in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday. In a speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urged the Soviets to show `` signs of new thinking'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said the region was `` not a dumping ground'' for arms and failed ideologies of outsiders. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, to be preceded by a brief stop Sunday in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and followed by a visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, had been set for December. After addressing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and meeting <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, however, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broke off his trip and flew home after the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` We are not going to worsen our relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' one Soviet specialist on Latin American affairs said of the visit to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. `` But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a very persuasive man and he will try to explain his intentions.'' The expert said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will inform <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is no longer interested in financing class struggle and wars of national liberation abroad. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who just celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, has supported armed struggle not only in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as well. After years of backing leftist forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops recently began a withdrawal from southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as part of a Soviet-backed negotiated settlement between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A senior Western analyst, who like the Soviet expert spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also is likely to tell <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> privately that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ca n't afford to subsidize <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s economy indefinitely `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been protected from his mistakes by Soviet aid,'' the Western diplomat said, citing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calculations that Soviet economic assistance account for perhaps 20 percent of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s gross national product. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of perestroika seeks to decentralize the communist-controlled economy, open markets and create financial incentives for improved production, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s `` correction of errors'' campaign has clamped tighter government controls on production while shutting down peasants' markets and seeking to eradicate pay differences among workers. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s determination to follow communist doctrine in the face of widespread evidence that his island's economy is in shambles prompted the Western analyst to observe, `` It's easy to talk about ideological purity when somebody else is paying for it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources say there already have been substantial reductions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as evidenced in the marked decline in the purchase of sugar, which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> buys from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at prices substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has embarked on a major overhaul of its own ailing economy and has taken steps to extract itself from regional conflicts that have drained its resources while threatening to blow up into superpower confrontation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 7 his plan to pare a half-million men from the Soviet armed forces, withdraw thousands of tanks and other offensive military units from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and ease tensions on the Chinese border by drawing down Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. The Kremlin completed its promised military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15. Three weeks later, it entered talks with the West in search of a negotiated reduction of all conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But Soviet intentions are less clear in <LOCATION> Centeral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continues to receive substantial Soviet military aid _ much of it channeled through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ and Salvadoran rebels press their civil war with East bloc weaponry. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has backed the Salvadoran government and Contra guerrillas in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Western diplomat noted, `` is one of the last remaining really hot regional conflicts outside the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in which there's a strong superpower presence.'' In his address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected `` the use or threat of force'' as an instrument of foreign policy, calling instead for new world order based on `` universal human consensus'' and respect for individual differences. `` As the world asserts its diversity,'' he said, `` attempts to look down on others and to teach them one's own brand of democracy become totally improper to say nothing of the fact that democratic values intended for export often very quickly lose their worth.'' Adhering to that policy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is unlikely to lecture <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> on how to run his own country, but it remains to be seen how much the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to subsidize <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s longstanding deficit economy.

 Telephone users will be charged less for their interstate phone calls starting today as a result of rate reductions by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its interstate long-distance rates will drop by $ 637.5 million annually, for a 1.9 percent overall reduction in its residential and small business prices <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would cut its rates by $ 200 million a year starting today. The cuts represent a pass-along to customers of savings that result from a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> order that local companies cut the charges to the long-distance carriers for connecting with local phone systems. The local companies had proposed a $ 489 million cut, but the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ordered them last week to cut back by $ 705 million. But the savings also reflect a 30-cent increase in the charge that customers pay to help maintain the local telephone networks. That increase is effective today as well.

 Roses are red, violets are blue. ... Or are they? Philosophers from around the country will gather in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> next week to discuss whether color is only in the eye of the beholder. The eighth annual colloquium in philosophy April 6-7 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> will include presentations by professors from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> universities, as well as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` What's at issue is whether we have color in the world in the same way that we have shape in the world,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwall </PERSON>, the philosophy department chairman at <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. When it comes to color, philosophers tend to fall into two camps. Some argue that colors have an objective existence independent of our perception of them, <PERSON> Darwall </PERSON> said. Others argue that color is an illusion; that an object's characteristics cause it to reflect light a certain way, making people believe they are seeing a certain color, he added The question of color is recognized as a primary element in the debate between philosophers supporting a realistic outlook and their counterparts advocating an anti-realist point of view, <PERSON> Darwall </PERSON> said. `` It's a litmus test for different philosophical points of view,'' <PERSON> Darwall </PERSON> said of the color clash. Not much is expected to be resolved at the conference, <PERSON> Darwall </PERSON> said. `` It's not the case in philosophy that we get discoveries that are recognized instantly by all credible philosophers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Soviet authorities have released hundreds of dissidents from confinement, but at least 100 remain in prisons, labor camps and psychiatric hospitals, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> reported. The group released its latest Soviet human rights report on Friday, two days after the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee voted to readmit a Soviet organization. Many psychiatrists in that association were reported opposed to the decision, which must be approved by its general assembly later this year. However, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment on that vote. The human rights organization said it had asked to speak with Soviet officials about the cases during the three-day visit of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which begins Wednesday. They said they had received no response. Amnesty also said in its report that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> citizens still could be prosecuted for exercising free speech or religion. `` Although there has been much improvement and discussion of human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the rhetoric of human rights will no doubt dominate next week's visit, the reality is that there are still serious human rights concerns there,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON>, director of the group's British section. She and the coordinator for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Venables </PERSON>, spoke to reporters about <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent briefing paper on Soviet human rights, dated March 1989. It says <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> knows of at least 100 prisoners known or thought to be dissidents, including 25 in psychiatric hospitals, but that 300 have been freed since 1987. Although some prisoners have been transferred to better facilities since 1987, those still in labor camps and prisons `` are kept on monotonous, meager rations with only rudimentary medical care, and have to meet excessively high work targets, often involving heavy physical labor,'' the report said. <PERSON> Venables </PERSON> added: `` There has been no major improvement in the condition of prisoners. Cruelty and degrading treatment still continues.'' Psychiatric patients are given unnecessary drugs, a treatment `` meted out as a form of intimidation,'' he said. Most of the 100 prisoners are people who tried to emigrate without permission or conscientious objectors to mandatory military service, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. It said others are held for violating laws that restrict freedom of expression, religion, assembly and association. It welcomed elements of the new Soviet criminal code that recognize international rights agreements, abolish internal exile and reduce the number of capital crimes from 18 to six. A delegation from Amnesty is currently in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a nine-day visit that is scheduled to end Sunday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is changing some mortgage rules to help some homeowners to get rid of their private mortgage insurance earlier. When a home buyer puts less than 20 percent down on a house, the agency, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, requires the buyer to get mortgage insurance to guarantee mortgage payments. But the insurance fee boosts the monthly payment required until the homebuyer builds up equity representing 20 percent of the home's value. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> required that a mortgage be held at least seven years before the insurance could be lifted even if the value of the home soars and the owner's equity rises above 80 percent. Under the change announced Friday, the insurance can be lifted in two to five years, depending on circumstances and provided that mortgage payments have been made on time.

<HEAD>Trump Finally Poised to Take Controls of Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Real estate tycoon <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is taking control of strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Northeast shuttle, and some union officials say the sale of the rest of the carrier is a foregone conclusion. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> announced late Friday that he had completed a restructured deal to buy the three-city shuttle for $ 365 million, the same price he agreed to pay in October in a tentative accord with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent. But the final deal gives <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> four more <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s for a total of 21. Eastern's unions, which have crippled the airline by honoring a strike by its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union since March 4, have made the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> a priority in their battle against <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Some union officials said Friday the shuttle deal and signs that a group led by former baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> might still try to buy the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could indicate the carrier's sale is inevitable. The unions long have claimed that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> _ whom they revile as a union buster _ has been trying to strip Eastern of its assets and funnel them to sister company <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier. Before and since Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection March 9, the unions vigorously have opposed any separate auctions of Eastern assets such as planes, airport gates and landing rights. The recent talks could indicate a sale is likely, and that it would be a single deal for the entire airline, minus the shuttle, the unions say. `` I believe that Eastern vis-a-vis <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is now in a sale mode ... that's what we would favor,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A used 727 fetches $ 4.5 million to $ 6 million, indicating <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was getting $ 18 million to $ 24 million more in assets for the same price. `` I am delighted to complete this transaction and very much look forward to building an airline that provides superior service for all consumers,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Friday. The agreement still must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Eastern is reorganizing under protection from creditors. The <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped to close the deal within 60 days. `` This agreement proves that the value of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets remains high and continues to be attractive to various parties,'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said. The pilots' union, which has been highly critical of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, also expressed approval of the deal. `` The money that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> gets for the shuttle has to come here, to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ... That's a positive,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. Before the strike, the shuttle serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s only profitable operation. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had agreed to pay $ 365 million for the Eastern shuttle in October in a tentative accord with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. But last week he sought to cut the price by a third because the continuing strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists, supported by its pilots and flight attendants, had eroded the shuttle's value as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> passengers started switching to the rival <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> countered by telling <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> it would look for other buyers, and <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, an aggressive Phoenix-based regional carrier, expressed interest. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he still planned to recognize the Eastern unions as bargaining representatives for <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> employees, as in his October accord, and to negotiate separate labor agreements with the shuttle workers. `` We have absolutely great relations with all three unions,'' he said.

 Buoyed by support from key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> leaves for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials they must move quickly to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, Egyptian officials said. The four-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s seventh since taking office in 1981, follows six weeks of intensive diplomatic exchanges initiated by the Egyptian leader. The activity brought leaders from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday. `` <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is carrying to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time a unified Arab position for the achievement of <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace,'' said a senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` This gives <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> greater credibility.'' The unified position was forged in <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s Egyptian talks during the past week with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The official said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will argue a need for speedy movement by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept an international peace conference and negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fears it would be pressured into concessions as a result of such a conference, and it rejects <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group as terrorists. The conference, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, would group parties to the conflict, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Egyptian official also said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and his Arab backers would like to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> use his influence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to convene an international conference before the end of this year. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, in prepared remarks for the local media on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s visit, dampened hopes for quick breakthrough as a result of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts. `` It will not be easy to arrive at quick results,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said. `` What we should do is build confidence to bring the parties to the negotiating table.'' He seemed to be referring to a desire by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for reciprocal moves by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to stop violence in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stip </LOCATION>. A Palestinian uprising in those territories has killed more than 415 Palestinians and 18 Israelis since it began in December 1987. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks also will deal with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and ways of easing <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s foreign debt burden. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held up $ 230 million in cash aid for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1988 and 1989, saying <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> failed to adopt `` significant'' economic reforms. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> says he agrees on the need for economic reforms but disagrees with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the pace of such steps. He fears austerity measures might trigger street violence. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s foreign debt totals about $ 44 billion.

 The bodies of four young men were found stuffed in the a parked car in what police said was the city's worst murder case in 13 years Police called by an apartment building resident discovered one body Friday in the car's back seat with its sneaker-clad feet sticking out of the rear window, said Cpl. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, a police spokesman. A second body was found underneath the first victim, and two other corpses were found in the trunk of the silver <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> license plates, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. The car was left in the building's parking lot, he said. The victims were black and in their late teens or early 20s, he said. They had yet to be identified, and police did not have suspects. `` There were signs of violence, blood,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. A witness who asked not to be identified said stuffed teddy bears were piled around one victim in the back seat. Police said violent crime is unusual in the <LOCATION> Norview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> neighborhood with frame cottages and ranch homes, but the parking lot is within blocks of the low-income Lakeland Apartments, a frequent destination for police. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said the crime was the city's worst mass murder since May 1976, when a 21-year-old man walked into a crowded downtown nightspot and opened fire, killing four people and wounding three before killing himself.

 A dentist has been sentenced to 30 months' probation for forgery in a bizarre case involving a dead man whose mummified remains were tended by his family for nine years. <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> opted for probation for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, 57, who lived for two years with the family of the dead man, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. State's Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbell </PERSON> had recommended a three-year prison term. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who has lost his license to practice dentistry, was convicted recently of witnessing a forgery of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' signature, which was placed on a document by the widow, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The judge noted at Thursday's hearing that Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was sentenced to 24 months of probation after she pleaded guilty to two counts of forgery in the case last year. During the hearing, both sides recalled how <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' body was tended by his family and <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> as if he were still alive. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a diabetic, died in 1979 after joining a holistic health cult and halting his daily insulin injections. In January 1988, authorities discovered his body in the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> home. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> lived at the home from summer 1986 until the body was discovered. <ORGANIZATION> Kimbell </ORGANIZATION> argued that <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> should be given a stiff sentence because he harmed Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' two teen-age children by promoting the `` strange idea'' that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was alive as his mummified corpse remained in the home. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> said he signed as a witness to the 1984 document that gave Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> her husband's power of attorney because she wanted to refinance her home. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> said his immediate plans are to return to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to live with his sister, and perhaps teach nutrition or practice dentistry if he can renew his license. `` I've got to get on with my life,'' he said. `` I think I'll start by going fishing.

 Thieves stole antiques worth more than $ 1.7 million from <LOCATION> Sulgrave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, the English ancestral home of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, police said. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who lived seven generations before the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, bought the property in <LOCATION> Sulgrave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in 1539. Its manor house is now run as a museum and contains much memorabilia from early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The stolen items include a spoon, a chandelier, three clocks of the 17th and 18th centuries, and a rare Breeches Bible, police said Friday. The bible is named after a 1560 edition that called the fig-leaf coverings made by <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve `` breeches.'' Detective Inspector <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said burglars took the antiques, which he called `` irreplaceable,'' after breaking into the Tudor manor house through a second-floor window.

<HEAD>Girl Scouts ``Camp Out'' Atop Empire State Building</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was n't exactly a country outing, but 57 Girl Scouts went on a camping trip very few people will ever top. They camped out Friday night on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building and even got a late night visit from movie monster King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON>, known for his climb up the landmark edifice when it was still the world's tallest. Although a cloudy evening obscured usually spectacular nighttime views of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the girls did n't seem to mind as they played games, sang songs, pledged allegiance to the flag and recited the Girl Scout promise. And the girls, mostly from the city's boroughs of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, were oblivious to the rainy, busy streets 1,050 feet below as they arranged sleeping bags and blankets for the night. Some people are bothered by ants and other bugs on camping excursions, but 9-year-old <PERSON> Lenata </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> was unconcerned by the insectlike things she saw. `` I looked down and everything looked like bugs,'' she said as she looked out of an 80th-floor window before the girls went up to the 86th-floor observatory. <PERSON> Stephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 9, presented an urban perspective on the merits of sleeping high up in the 102-story building that would be lost on people whose idea of camping out is a bit more down to earth. `` Out in the country when we went one time, we could get lost,'' she said. `` It's nice here and it's a big place. It's exciting.'' The idea to camp out high in the Empire State Building was the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafter </PERSON>'s. He's been the unofficial chaplain of the Empire State Building since the mid-1960s. The building opened in 1931. The nearest campgrounds for Girl Scouts, he said, are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the city's <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> borough; so he approached the building's officials. They agreed to an annual November trip for Boy Scouts and a yearly March outing for the Girl Scouts. `` The idea is for the girls from different troops to make new friends and learn that whether they're black, white, green, blue or whatever, they're all Americans,'' <PERSON> Rafter </PERSON> said. The `` hike'' to the campsite consisted of a leisurely stroll around the lobby as <PERSON> Rafter </PERSON> led a tour of the first floor. But getting to the top of the campsite could be daunting, 9-year-old <PERSON> Shunte </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> pointed out. `` In the elevator, it felt like my stomach was dropping and my ears stopped up,'' she said. For those who might think the girls are being deprived of a true camping experience, troop leader <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Waszak </PERSON> was quick to point out the girls often camp outdoors in more sylvan settings. <PERSON> Waszak </PERSON> recalled how a freak snowstorm nearly buried the girls in their sleeping bags in <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in October 1987. She looked around the enclosed area on the 86th floor where the girls would sleep Friday and said: `` This is quite milder with no chance of being snowed in.'' But not everyone was ecstatic about spending the night at the building. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, 9, would have preferred a more natural environment. `` I'd rather be camping out in the countryside,'' she said. `` I think that would be more fun.''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mexican officials today plan to launch one of the largest crackdowns ever on drug trafficking along the 2,000-mile border from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal Attorney General's Office, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will share intelligence information and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will deploy army troops, police reinforcements and extra drug agents for the project The operation will run from <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, all the way to <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Friday. `` It is possibly the largest of its kind. There are more arms, more vehicles, more personnel,'' he said. He gave few specifics. However, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s anti-drug efforts, recently said a special narcotics interdiction group of 1,200 people would be ready by April. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Jornada </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper, said at least a dozen federal helicopters and 30 airplanes have been sent to <PERSON> Hermosillo </PERSON>, the capital of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state, for the project. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> referred questions about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where officials were not available for comment. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said the new program will be permanent. He said it is styled after Operation Alliance, a U.S.-Mexico effort begun in August 1986. Operation Alliance involved hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal agents and millions of dollars worth of surveillance equipment to detect drug-ferrying airplane flights across the border. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general at that time, called Operation Alliance `` the most widespread interdiction program on our land borders in law enforcement history.'' The new campaign `` is similar, but much bigger,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. U.S.-Mexican relations have been strained by the flow of drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who took office Dec. 1, promised to increase manpower and other resources to combat the drug trade. Drug trafficking and related violence along the Mexico-U.S. border have increased as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressed its anti-drug efforts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Mexican authorities believe the torture-killings of nine people this week in a town across the border from <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, were drug-related. The mutilated bodies of two men and three women were found in a well, and four other bodies were found in a nearby septic tank on an abandoned ranch two miles west of <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaviezca </PERSON>, chief of the state police in <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, said seven people were under arrest, including a Mexican federal customs agent. <ORGANIZATION> Agua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prieta </ORGANIZATION> has emerged as a major drug channel the past two years. Some police call it `` cocaine alley.'' <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imparcial </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>'s capital of <PERSON> Hermosillo </PERSON>, reported two suspects in the killings told police the victims were slain in retaliation for the disappearance of 220 pounds of drugs. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspapers said the drug was cocaine.

<TEXT>
 The foreign ministers from five Central American countries broke off two days of talks after they were unable to agree on how to disband the army of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. However, the ministers said they will meet again in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on April 13-14 to continue their negotiations. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has pushed for quick disbanding of the rebels, most of whom live in border camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> told reporters that the diplomats could not `` arrive at an accord for demobilization of the Contras.'' The Central American presidents agreed Feb. 14 to come up with a plan by mid-May for disarming the rebels. They would either be repatriated with their families or relocated. In exchange, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said it would adopt domestic democratic reforms. The agreement took <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by surprise. They have said the rebels should remain in place as an army to put pressure on the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to make reforms. The foreign ministers disagreed. `` It is the collective responsibility of the five governments to look for paths to obtain the demobilization,'' Honduran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> told a news conference after talks ended. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has been a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, but it has recently objected publicly to the presence of the rebels, known as Contras, on its territory. However, the foreign minister said his government did not have a specific plan for demobilization. `` What we have are ideas, reflections,'' he said. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> to lay groundwork for a regional summit at which their presidents are to decide how to disband the Contras. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said earlier Friday that the summit would be put off from May 15 to June 15 to allow <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s new president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, to take office. At the San Jose meetings, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> also gave his colleagues a proposal for a regional fight against drug trafficking that would include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. The foreign ministers said they will try to meet in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> April 11-12 to discuss the proposal. They also agreed to meet in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> in early May to prpare for the presidential summit. The exact dates of the second <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> meeting are to be decided later. Although no accords were reached, the foreign ministers said the talks were fruitful. `` If we did n't believe peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was possible, we would n't be fighting for it,'' Costa Rican Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said. The Contras fought the Nicaraguan government for eight years. However, the fighting has trailed off since early last year, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the rebels. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday that $ 45 million in non-military aid under consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be used to disband the Contras.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> minority gathered today to pray for 22 people who were killed when rebel rockets hit a Sikh Temple in the besieged city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Sikhs who were brought by government helicopter to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 21 Sikhs and one Hindu were killed Thursday when rockets landed in and around the Sikh Gurdwara, or Temple. The names of the six men and 16 women and children who died were read out by a Sikh elder after the service. The dead were part 65 people who were killed Thursday and Friday when U.S.-backed Islamic rebels fired rockets and artillery shells into <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a strategic city near the Khyber Pass and on the main highway leading to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the Pakistani border. The U.S.-backed guerrillas chose <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> as their first major objective, following the final withdrawal of Soviet troops on Feb. 15, toward toppling the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and establishing a Moslem republic. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also backs the rebels. Many observers believe if the rebels take <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, it could break the morale of government troops and lead to the collapse of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The death toll the last two days has been the highest reported by the government since Soviet forces ended nine years of involvement in the Afghan war.

Also included would be a library of 4,000 movies, among them the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> and Pink Panther series, the video library and movie and television production and distribution facilities. The agreement is subject to unspecified government, shareholder and third-party approvals, according to a joint announcement by the two companies. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to elaborate on a news release, which said the deal was expected to be completed by late summer. It is the second time this year <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> has agreed to sell part of the company he assembled out of the former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> studios.

<HEAD>New Fusion Experiment Gives Hope, But Far From Proven, Scientist
Cautions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientist who reported that a simple apparatus may create fusion power at room temperature said his work gives hope for a new energy source, but warned that `` fusion fever'' enthusiasm is premature. `` I think we have a new approach to fusion,'' but it is too early to say whether it will prove useful for generating electricity, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The results still must withstand scientific scrutiny and be confirmed by other scientists, and until that happens, `` do n't sell your oil well,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Even if the results hold up, it would take many years before the process could be put to practical use, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Friday at a physics colloquium and a later press conference at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars, where tremendous amounts of energy are released when the nucleus, or core, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of another hydrogen atom. In contrast, today's nuclear power plants get energy from fission, which is the splitting of atoms. Scientists hope to harness fusion power, saying it provides an environmentally benign energy source with a virtually unlimited source of fuel: `` heavy'' hydrogen, which occurs naturally in water. Standard fusion experiments use extremely high temperatures to get the hydrogen atoms to fuse. But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> announced recently that they had independently found a simple way to produce fusion reactions at room temperature. Essentially, they used electrical current to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes, where the hydrogen atoms apparently fused. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researchers said their apparatus produced four times as much energy as it consumed. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, in contrast, said the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> device appeared to produce only about one ten-trillionth of the energy put into it. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he had not read the other team's scientific paper and could not explain the difference. The <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> apparatus included a pair of electrodes immersed in `` heavy water,'' in which hydrogen atoms contain an extra particle called a neutron in the nucleus. This kind of hydrogen is called deuterium. When low voltage was applied to the electrodes, deuterium nuclei were drawn into one of the electrodes. There, they apparently crowded together closely enough to fuse, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Researchers calculated that two fusions occurred every five seconds, which would yield an energy output of one ten-trillionth of a watt. One watt is about enough to run an electric toothbrush. The evidence for fusion was that the apparatus emitted neutrons, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. That happened when the nuclei were driven into electrodes made from either titanium or palladium, with titanium giving the better results, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We do n't really have a good theory'' to explain the fusion, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Perhaps deuterium nuclei are forced close enough to fuse while hopping from site to site within the crystal structure of the electrode, he said. He calls the fusion approach piezonuclear fusion, because `` piezo'' means `` to squeeze.'' A similar process may cause part of the heat at the Earth's core, he said In <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one of two researchers who first announced the discovery, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, said Friday he had found no chemical explanation for the process by which he achieved sustained, controlled nuclear fusion in a simple experiment. `` It can not be explained by any known chemical process,'' said <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can conceive of no other process other than a nuclear process'' to explain the results.

 About 6,500 Savannah River Plant workers got $ 80 million in severance and vacation pay as operator <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> handed over operation of the nuclear weapons plant to <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> today.

About 1,200 workers decided to retire. Many of the severance and vacation checks ranged from $ 20,000 to $ 30,000, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of the plant credit union. `` I'm crying all the way to the bank,'' joked 22-year <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, who said he was going to use his $ 10,000-plus check to buy a new tractor. `` It's like Christmas has come at the end of March,'' <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Murff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aiken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday.

Fiercely protective of its image and copyrights, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> filed the lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, alleging that <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> producers did not have permission to use the Disney-copyrighted fairy tale character. The broadcast, seen in an estimated 27 million American homes, began Wednesday night with actress <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, dressed as Snow White, following a chorus line of dancing stars into the Shrine Auditorium. In a squeaky <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Boop </PERSON> voice, <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> then launched into a rendition of `` We Only Have Stars for You,'' to the tune of `` I Only Have Eyes for You.'' She also sang a rendition of `` Proud Mary'' with actor <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. Disney spokesman <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the performance was unflattering to the beloved character, and Disney President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said the matter could have been settled without litigation if the academy had publicly apologized. `` For its own reasons, however, the academy unfortunately did not accede to our request,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The Oscar show's producer, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, declined to comment because of the pending lawsuit. All media queries were referred to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who said it was strange that the use of the character had not been cleared with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obtaining rights is one of the things we do routinely,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Every little three seconds of music, or a film clip, has to get cleared. Yes, it is very puzzling. We are exploring the reasons for that.'' `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was released by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> in 1937 and was the studio's first feature-length animated cartoon. Critics praised the film, calling it a turning point in <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s career and a milestone in movie history

 Christian and Syrian gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today despite a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plea for a cease-fire in the 25-day confrontation.

A police spokesman said the leader of the breakaway faction, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankir </PERSON>, `` surrendered to <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>'s militia at 8 a.m. ... Life is normal in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>.'' The spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with shells and rockets before dawn. He said gunners of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000-strong Christian army responded to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> fire coming from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Druse central mountains and <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of the capital as well as the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Several 155mm U.S.-designed howitzer shells, fired by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, exploded in residential districts of Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the pre-dawn shelling, the spokesman said A Christian military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians today deployed 180mm Soviet-designed howitzers for the first time since the current round of violence broke out March 8. `` They are using the heavy howitzers to knock out army bunkers and fortifications. It seems they want to use it to demolish vital utilities as well,'' the source said. The clashes erupted after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped a blockade on militia-run illegal ports in an effort to reactivate tax-collection at the five government harbors along the 130-mile coastline. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> escalated the crisis by declaring a `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.

Two boys found the eighth body, that of a young woman, Friday along Route 88 about 25 feet from the road, police said. `` Indications are that this is linked to the other seven and we do in fact have our eighth victim in the highway murders,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the district attorney. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said the woman appeared to be in her late teens to early 20s. The first seven victims had been involved in prostitution or drugs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, according to family members and police. The first victim was found in July. The most recent was discovered Tuesday. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said his office got an anonymous letter two weeks ago with information about the missing women. The district attorney said the letter writer offered quite a bit of information about the missing women. `` They indicated roughly where the body would be on 88 and said they were hesitant to come forward,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. `` But they said they would possibly come forward if we found a body on 88. Well, it's here. The body is on 88.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the remains were taken to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, where an autospy would be performed.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today left <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> convinced she has a role to play in seeking a political settlement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamuzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Banda </PERSON>, who is in his 80s, kissed the British leader's hand as she curtsied to him in a departure ceremony at <LOCATION> Chileka </LOCATION> airport near the commercial capital of <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s destination was kept secret, evidently for security reasons, but she arrived shortly after noon today in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, on the first day of that southwest African territory's process toward independence from South African control Among those she was expected to meet was South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. On her current African swing, the British premier has visited <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. On each leg of the tour she has expressed hope that conditions are right for a negotiated end to conflict in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> playing a role in any possible political breakthrough in white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At a banquet hosted by <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> at his hilltop palace outside <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> late Friday, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she was visiting a continent torn by strife but she came `` with the conviction that this is the time of new hope for Southern Africa''. She cited the U.N-supervised independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting today as evidence of a conciliatory mood in the region which secured a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> itself, `` one sees a growing acceptance that discrimination based on race and color must end and will end, that black South Africans must be allowed to play their part in politics and government.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has said it is prepared assist in mediation efforts in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on condition jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is released first and that the guerrilla leader renounces violence. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has argued that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has unique expertise based on experience gained from relinquising power in its former African colonies, particularly <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. An all-party conference chaired by <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> in 1979 ended a seven-year guerrilla war in white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> and led to the birth of the independent nation of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> the following year. On her African tour, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has restated he opposition to an economic blockade of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, contending that sanctions would hurt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks the most. In <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, `` now there must be free and fair elections just like those which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> organized in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> nine years ago,'' she said. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was expected to hold talks with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> later today and visit <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in the territory which has been controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since World War 1.

 Winter weather returned today to parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, with storms dumping snow in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and delaying spring field work for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers. Low pressure off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast brought snow to parts of the lower Great Lakes region and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, snowstorms lingered after leaving up to 7 inches of snow in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> and 5 inches in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, where police reported numerous accidents as drivers coped with the reprise of winter weather. `` Cars are off the road everywhere,'' said a state trooper in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Henrietta </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know if it's the busiest day of the year, but it's been busy. People forgot how to drive. You get a couple of nice days and now it's winter again.'' In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the cold weather slowed the growth of wheat and pastures across the state. More than 8 inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, and snowstorms remained today in much of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, widely scattered rain showers extended mainly from eastern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and a few showers and thunderstorms dampened southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Today's forecast called for rain from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; snow in the central and northern Appalachians; rain and snow showers in the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; widespread rain in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>; and showers across the northern and central Rockies.

 Five oil pollution specialists from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, including an expert on sea birds, are en route to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to help contain damage from the worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil spill in history. The group is scheduled to arrive later today at <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground March 24 and dumped 240,000 barrels of crude oil along the Alaskan coast. `` We can show them ways to clean up oily waste and how to dispose of it so it breaks down more quickly,'' said <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> <PERSON> Koefoed </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. He described a process of spreading out waste over a layer of bark and turning it several times a year to help nature break it down. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s offer to lend its expertise was accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, according to <LOCATION> Koefoed </LOCATION>. He is not a member of the team. The group will be led by <PERSON> Oeyvind </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON>, another official with the pollution authority. Speaking in a telephone interview, <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON>, 44, said the biologists, zoologists, equipment and training experts in the team have experience from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s own offshore oil industry and from international oil disasters. `` We have a lot of practice in monitoring oil companies' handling of environmental problems,'' he said The other team members are sea bird expert <PERSON> Tycho </PERSON> <PERSON> Anker-Nilssen </PERSON>, 35, of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Reidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindrum </PERSON>, 38, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppangen </PERSON>, 52, an oil spill equipment specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>; and training specialist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nerland </PERSON>, 45, from the same center. `` We can help select areas that most need protection and which research projects are needed to document the effect of the disaster on animals, birds and fish,'' said <PERSON> Hindrum </PERSON>, a wildlife expert who studies conflicts between ecology and the oil business.

 A police officer who shot and killed three people in seven months was fired after notches were found carved into his pistol. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 25, was dismissed Friday after <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigators discovered two marks on the 9mm pistol's trigger guard while looking into the third killing in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the first two killings. He fatally shot <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> on Aug. 2 when <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> raised a handgun toward <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and a fellow officer. Less than three weeks later, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> shot 33-year-old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> during a struggle that occurred along Interstate 30 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 21, on Feb. 1 while serving a warrant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The same gun was used in all three killings, said Officer <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` These markings and their possible inference were obviously very troublesome to us,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said during a news conference. `` We do not know at this point who put the marks on the gun and what they signify.'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> told investigators he was unaware of the markings. His weapon was confiscated after each of the first two shootings, a standard procedure, but <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the markings were n't found until after the third shooting. `` No one noticed any markings,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` All I can say is that they were not noticed or reported to us after the first two shootings. I ca n't say whether they were there or not, factually.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would not describe the nicks, and he did not speculate when asked if investigators felt the marks represented some sort of kill tally. `` We have not been able to determine what they mean,'' he said.

One of the pictures accompanying the item showed a man on a snowy slope holding up a 12-foot ruler that the paper said would be used `` to ensure the mountain reaches its height of 19,552 feet.'' `` The story was designed to suit the day,'' said <PERSON> Wandala </PERSON>.

 A former rooming house landlady, who was arrested when the bodies of seven tenants were unearthed in her front yard last year, has been charged with eight more counts of murder. <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was charged with the additional counts Friday, bringing to nine the number of elderly or disabled people the woman is accused of poisoning in order to get their Social Security checks. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, 60, pleaded innocent to each of the charges before Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>. She faces the death penalty if convicted. She previously had been charged with a single count of murder. On Friday, the district attorney's office added eight counts, including the seven buried bodies, a body found in a box along the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a former patient of <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who once worked as a nurse. Investigators said all of the victims were <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s former tenants. They were killed over a three-year period, except for the nursing patient, who died in 1982 of an apparent codeine overdose. Supervising Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> said authorities were also investigating the death of another patient nursed by <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s court-appointed lawyer, declined to discuss the case. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> has a record of state and federal criminal offenses, including a 1982 conviction for defrauding two elderly people and robbing and drugging a third.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of dockworkers and students armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks fought police for the second consecutive day today, protesting a police crackdown that ended a prolonged strike at the nation's largest shipyard. About 3,500 protesters took to the streets of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, about 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, in scattered protests, news reports said. Police fired tear gas and charged the protesters, who responded with rocks and firebombs in hit-and-run battles, according to the South Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. The report said nothing of arrests or injuries. Thousands of riot police guarded <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, where the strike was broken up, and established checkpoints around bus terminals and on roads leading to the shipyard to block sympathizers from joining the protesters, it said. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 1,000 students supporting <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> strikers battled riot police around <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for an hour after burning effigies of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>. The Ulsan shipyard is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group, one of the largest conglomerates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. One of its subsidiaries manufactures cars for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto market. Masked students brandishing firebombs streamed out of the gates, yelling `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who stifles workers' rights!'' About 2,000 riot police sealed off the campus and fired hundreds of tear gas shells. There were no immediate reports of arrests and injuries in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Operations of the Hyundai shipyard remained slow, although more than half of its 22,000-member work force showed up for work today. Riot police stormed the shipyard Thursday in a land, sea and air attack to end the strike, whose violence injured about 400 people since December. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s trouble began last Dec. 12, when militant workers broke away from a company-sanctioned union and organized a separate group, demanding pay hikes and better working conditions. The police intervention triggered violent protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government of suppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost of workers.

 Cherokee Indians from across the country are observing the 150th anniversary of the Trail of Tears, the forced march from their Southeastern homeland that claimed an estimated 4,000 lives. `` In Cherokee memory it is only a short time ago,'' <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>, told about 300 people gathered Friday on the lawn of the old Cherokee national capitol in this northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> city of 10,000. The observance ends today. The forced relocation of much of the tribe to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> ended in late 1839. Of the estimated 4,000 Cherokees who died, many were buried in unmarked graves. `` And yet here we are. Here we are. Despite everything that has happened to us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said. Today, the 93,000-member <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> is the nation's second largest, behind the Navajos. Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> and Chief <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of the eastern band of Cherokees from <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, planted an oak tree on the capitol grounds `` in memory of many people who were on the trail who did not make it to the new home,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>. Officials had made it clear the prayers and speeches were to be more a memorial service than a celebration, but some said their ancestors' travails 150 years ago were not being emphasized enough. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> of <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, vice chairman of Native Americans for a Clean Environment, asked that April 1 be recognized as an international day of sorrow in memory of those who died on the Trail of Tears. `` The forced relocation of Cherokee and other indigenous people, known as the Trail of Tears, was an act of genocide,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. `` While it is a very, very sad time in our history, I still believe we can draw strength from our ancestors,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>. `` I've been able to draw strength from that terrible time in our history.'' She emphasized that when they were relocated the Cherokees were a civilized, self-governing tribe. The tribe survived the Trail of Tears to reform its government, establish schools, and erect civic buildings in northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. However, in 1906 the tribe's land was taken away; members were given individual allotments. The Cherokees had no constitutional tribal government until 1971, when the capitol was re-established in <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>.

 Thai pirates raided a boat full of Vietnamese refugees in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, massacred 45 of them and kidnapped about 11 women, officials said today. An old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack, which occurred within about the last seven days, said the officials, who work with refugees and who spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. The pirates stormed the unarmed boat, slashed the passengers with knives and threw their bodies overboard, the officials said. The attackers ran their boat over the floating bodies to make sure no one was alive, the sources said. The two survivors hid under planks floating in the water, and their boat later drifted to an <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rig in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the officials said. Workers picked up the two on Monday and sent them to the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> government hospital in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION>, 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. `` This is one of the worst cases of piracy reported in recent years, and the pirates nowadays kill the people after plundering the boats so that there would be no witnesses,'' said a senior refugee official. The refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full account of their experience. They did not say exactly when the attack took place or how many pirates took part. There was no word on the fate of the kidnapped women. `` The women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into the sea or abandoned in remote islands,'' said another refugee official. In January, refugee officials said two <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> women were raped and dumped on a remote Thai island before arriving at the camp. The women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed by Thai pirates late last year. The officials said such attacks by Thai pirates had decreased since the early 1980s when Thai and <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> authorities had stepped up boat patrols. The government reported that in March, about 2,000 Vietnamese refugees landed on <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> shores, almost double the average for the past few months. There are now about 16,500 Vienamese boat people in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the nations of the region accept the refugees only for temporary stay pending permanent settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

 Three East Germans trying to escape to the West crashed a car through a border barrier but were captured by guards, police said today.

 Heavily armed police today patrolled southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province to prevent demonstrations by ethnic Albanians marking the anniversary of Serb-Albanian rioting in 1981. Helmeted riot police patrolled the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the site of recent violence, but the city was calm. At least 24 people died and more than 200 were wounded in the province on Monday and Tuesday when thousands of ethnic Albanians protested constitutional changes that increased <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. It was the deadliest rioting since 1981, when at least nine people were killed. No incidents were reported today. Schools were closed, public gatherings banned and police enforced an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership met to discuss the recent rioting. They were also to discuss the resignation of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s ethnic Albanian president <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>. He stepped down in February after striking miners claimed he did not represent Albanian interests because he agreed to constitutional changes reducing <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s automony But the party leadership was expected not to accept <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>'s resignation in a move that could cause more unrest by ethnic Albanians, according to <PERSON> Iljaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramajlji </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency accused neighboring <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> of inciting the demonstrators and the interior minister complained out outside interference. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> have communist regimes that have remained independent of the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> Jusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Karakusi </PERSON> said Friday: `` The situation has the outward appearance of becoming calmer, but the organized hostile forces, acting from the position of Albanian nationalism and separatism, are not idle. They are preparing new actions.'' He said the riots were instigated by `` illegal hostile forces that are active in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and outside <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' He did not name those forces. A <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> commentary said <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> `` strongly incites extremist nationalists in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to actions against the law and order.'' The violence began after constitutional changes were made that gave <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, greater control over the judiciary, police and schools in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> _ a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> had gained a substantial degree of autonomy under <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 1974 consitution. But Serbian leaders said the new changes, which went into effect Tuesday, were necessary to protect the Slav minority from harassment by the ethnic Albanians that comprise 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population of 1.9 million.

 Travelers paying $ 39,000 a ticket set off today aboard a Concorde jet for the aircraft's first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe. American journalist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, Jr. is leading the 38,343-mile, 22-day voyage from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and beyond, said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the jet. Concordes have circled the globe before but not using supersonic speeds for each leg or for that distance, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. He said the jet could break more than a dozen world speed records during the trip, but he did not name the records he was referring to. Most segments of the tour will take less than three hours. For example, the jet will fly the 3,000 miles from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in two hours, 40 minutes. He said a Miami-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel firm, <ORGANIZATION> Lorraine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, chartered the jet for the tour and that all 100 seats for the trip had been sold out. Most passengers were scheduled to leave from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. During the trip, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> planned to broadcast his television show `` Firing Line'' from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Ticket prices included all hotels and meals as well as extras such as a safari in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and cruises in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>.

 Thousands of people gathered downtown today to pay final respects to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s last empress, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>, who was to be buried with all the pageantry of the monarchy that vanished more than 70 years ago. In an outpouring of sentiment for the <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Empire </LOCATION>, up to 2,000 people an hour moved by the velvet-draped coffin in St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> containing <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s body. Souvenir sellers outside the cathedral did a brisk trade in portraits of <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> as a young beauty and in T-shirts that marked the occasion. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s largest circulation newspaper, the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kronen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, took up its entire front page with a photograph of hundreds of mourners waiting to file past the coffin and the simple headline, `` Farewell to <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>.'' The headline ran against a background in yellow, the color of the imperial House of <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s funeral was planned as the biggest since the Hapsburg Empire buried Emperor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> in 1916. <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> died two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> at age 96. After the collapse of the monarchy in 1918, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, were forced into exile and all titles of nobility were abolished. All the Roman Catholic royal familes of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> sent representatives to the funeral, but no reigning monarchs attended. President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was among the mourners in the cathedral. At a Mass led by Cardinal <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON> the languages of the Hapsburg monarchy _ German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Croat, Slovenian and Polish _ sounded in the intercessions read for <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Scots Protest New Property Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Scots demonstrated today to protest a new tax that symbolizes the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> government many of them reject. Bagpipers led a crowd estimated at 12,000 through the streets to protest the change, which eliminates local property taxes and substitutes a flat tax rate for all people 18 and over. The change took effect today. Speakers from opposition parties, churches and other groups urged people not to pay it _ a response long supported by Scottish nationalists seeking to make the tax a major issue. `` I have got absolutely no intention of paying -LRB- the new -RRB- tax,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>'s lord provost. She said she would refuse to pay to join the poor who `` ca n't afford it.'' The tax is part of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s crusade against socialism and high-spending local governments. It requires each local authority to calculate its expenses and set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident 18 and over. The sums are expected to average $ 436 a year per adult, with 80 percent rebates available for those on low incomes. The government says it will make local governments more accountable by forcing municipalities to stop financing social programs for those who pay little or no tax with money collected from the middle class. But many Scots have said the tax revenue will not be returned to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Opinion polls show that many believe they will be worse off because of the new tax, which is due to take effect in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in a year. The Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks outright independence for the 5.2 million Scots, was collecting signatures of people pledging not to pay the tax.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he would have gotten nowhere with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had he tried to win new military aid for the Contras, and he denies his diplomatic approach to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> means the military efforts had failed. `` There was no way, not a snowball's chance in hell, of getting a dime for lethal aid, military aid, from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday in a question-and-answer session with a group of regional media representatives. `` And I think anybody who's familiar with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would acknowledge that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today engaged in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomacy, meeting with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, and several top administration officials. The group, including Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, discussed a range of issues of concern to the Latin world, including the Third World debt crisis and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace efforts, according to a senior administration official. In the question-and-answer session Friday, rejected a suggestion that his emphasis on diplomacy in the region amounts to an admission that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of military support for the Contras had failed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said military pressure convinced <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to join in peace talks calling for democratic reforms in their country. On other issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also ruled out any backing away from his support for expanded oil exploration in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. To turn away from the oil resources in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, he said, would be irresponsible, despite the recent environmental disaster created by the 10-million gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker. `` We are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil, and that is not acceptable to any president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We have to transport oil. What we will do is not go backwards.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments Friday on the Contras were the first he has made indicating that the dim prospects for military aid influenced his decision to pursue a diplomatic solution. In a bipartisan package worked out with <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders, he is proposing $ 40 million in nonlethal aid to keep the Contras intact until the Nicaraguan elections at the beginning of next year. `` It's not bad, the policy has been well received,'' he said. `` We are speaking with one voice. We are going to push for democratization.'' As to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, the candidate of the rightist <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We will treat the Salvadoran winner on his word, that he wants to continue the democracy,'' espoused under outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. He pledged to `` redouble efforts'' for safe transport.

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed one Palestinian today in a clash in the village of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, and another reportedly died of wounds inflicted by Jewish settlers, the army and Arab hospital officials said. The victim in <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON> was shot when a group of Palestinians stoned an Israeli army jeep patrol and slightly injured two soldiers, the military said. An army spokesman said the Palestinian died at an east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hospital. Arab reporters identified the Palestinian as <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, 24, and said he was shot in the heart. The army said another Palestinian died of gunshot wounds suffered Thursday, but could not confirm reports by Arab hospital officials and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that he was shot by Jewish settlers. Arab reporters identified the victim as <PERSON> Tareq </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, 23. The two deaths would raise the Palestinian death toll to 417 since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis have also died. Arab reporters said <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>'s family took his body from <LOCATION> Muqassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and buried him in a cemetary near a grotto that was built in the 4th century A.D. to mark a site believed to be the tomb of <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>. The army imposed a curfew on the village's 4,000 residents after <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>'s funeral. Six Palestinians were also wounded in confrontations with troops. They included a 12-year-old Arab from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> who was shot in the hand; four Arabs were wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when troops opened fire to disperse a demonstration in the area's commercial center; and a 16-year-old boy who was shot and wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Hajah </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> about 180,000 residents remained under curfew in six refugee camps and neighborhoods. The longest standing curfew is on the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp where residents have been confined to their homes for 15 days.

<TEXT>
 It might be easy for those on the outside to dismiss President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as a hulking, former secret police chief presiding over a repressive government destined for defeat. But this same man has proved himself to be an eloquent orator, a shrewd combatant during political infighting, and a politician deft at appealing to feelings of nationalism. The test now at hand is the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas have besieged <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s forces nearly four weeks. Neither side has been able to claim victory. Thousands of people have surely died, although neither side has sufficient credibility for its casualty reports to be believed. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has fired his biggest guns, literally and figuratively. The Soviet-supplied Scud-B missiles launched toward <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> several times a day are monster-size weapons, but their impact may be as much psychological as physical. The government makes no effort to conceal its Scuds, trundling the 36-foot-long missiles through the center of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on open truck beds in broad daylight. The roar with which they are fired is unmistakable. Their message _ and that of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> MiGs and Sukhois _ is clear: <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s weapons outclass any rockets, mortars or shells the guerrillas can pack across the border from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its combat troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, it continues to supply the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government with Scuds, smaller weapons and food and says it will do so as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aids the guerrillas. The guerrillas are caught in a dilemma. They are most effective in hit-and-run attacks, not bogged down in confrontation with a regular army that outnumbers and outguns them. Conversely, regular armies rarely vanquish guerrilla forces militarily, as the Israelis learned against the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Indians against Tamil guerrillas in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The most effective solution is a political one, which is impossible to achieve unless both sides agree to negotiate. But guerrilla leaders refuse to talk to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and say they will not give up the fight until his Soviet-style party is removed. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is giving the political side his best shot. `` Fratricide brings nothing but misery and agony,'' the president said last week in a radio appeal aimed at the guerrillas' local commanders inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Referring to them as `` dear compatriots'' and `` my brothers'' and to their Pakistan-based political leaders as `` the enemy'' and `` the extremists,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> offered a cease-fire and local autonomy to commanders who would stop fighting. From guerrilla headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> came a rejection of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s offer. But the government claims it has opened negotiations with some local commanders it refused to identify. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> rarely misses an opportunity to accuse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of `` vicious warmongering,'' of imposing a foreign-inspired war on Afghans. It is a calculated ploy aimed at the fiercely independent and tribalistic Afghans' centuries-old antipathy to outsiders. There also seems to be a growing feeling in war-weary <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, although unquestionably an authoritarian leader, is not as bad as his predecessors in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>. The Afghan monarchy ended in 1973 when King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was overthrown by a cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>. Five years later, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> overthrew and assassinated <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, bringing <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> himself was killed in 1979 as party rival <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> took over. With the <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> regime teetering under guerrilla attacks and party feuds, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> later that year and <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> was assassinated. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, in turn was shunted aside by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights monitoring group, estimated that 35,000 Afghans have been imprisoned or disappeared _ the majority of them in the pre-Najib early 1980s. Under <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, there are still political arrests but the number of detentions has dropped sharly, according to several foreign observers who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> were crazy men. Maybe <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is not so bad,'' said one businessman. Others have expressed similar views. The party traditionally is divided between the <LOCATION> Parcham </LOCATION> faction headed by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and the Khalq faction of the late <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>. In October, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> purged Parchami dissidents and a month later dispatched the top <PERSON> Khalqi </PERSON> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulabzoi </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as ambassador _ a time-tested Afghan way of getting potential troublemakers out of the country.

 An April Fools' Day joke in a local newspaper turned sour Saturday when riot police were called to control more than 2,000 readers demanding cash prizes in a numbers game, officials said. The Dawasa newspaper Saturday offered readers the equivalent of about $ 300 in a numbers drawing and said the prize was to be claimed before noon. A police official said more than 2,000 readers gathered at the newspaper office in downtown <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and demanded the money. Riot police were called when the readers refused to accept the newspaper's explanation that the game was a joke, he said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the crowd dispersed only after management gave written assurances a final decision on the prizes would be made later.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of dockworkers and students armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks clashed with police Saturday to protest a police crackdown that ended a strike at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest shipyard About 3,500 workers and students battled police in the port city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, about 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, news reports said. The sporadic street fighting and protests lasted most of the day, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Thousands of high school students, shoppers and office workers caught in hit-and-run street battles fled, covering their mouths and faces from clouds of choking tear gas, reports said. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 1,000 students from <LOCATION> Hanyang </LOCATION> university protested the government decision to use 14,000 riot police to put down the more than 3-month-old strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> shipyard. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said 80 workers and police had been injured in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> since police entered the shipyard Thursday. The shipyard is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest conglomerates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Hundreds of masked students carrying banners with anti-government slogans streamed from the university gates shouting `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo who stifles workers' rights!'' They burned effigies of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, honorary chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>. Some hurled firebombs and swung wood and steel clubs, while others stood on walls surrounding the campus and threw rocks. Riot police fired hundreds of tear gas shells. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, a major radical student group, said it would launch a nationwide wave of attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> in support of workers. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> offices and automobile showrooms were attacked Friday and protesters battled police in seven cities. In <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, thousands of riot police guarded the shipyard and set up check points around bus terminals and on roads leading to the shipyard to block more sympathizers from joining the protesters, said <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. Operations at the shipyard were slow, although more than half of the 22,000-member work force showed up for work Saturday, officials said. Prosecutors brought formal charges against 10 union leaders for conspiring to cause violence and said investigations continued against some of 697 other workers who were arrested. Riot police stormed the shipyard Thursday in a land, sea and air attack to end a violent strike that left about 400 people injured. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s trouble began Dec. 12 when about 5,000 militant workers broke away from a company-sanctioned union and organized a separate group, demanding pay increases and better working conditions. The police intervention triggered violent protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government of suppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost of workers.

<TEXT>
 For his first appearance in the West since the Armenian earthquake cut short his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit in December, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has chosen a small nation that in some ways straddles <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s political, social and military divides. The Soviet president's stopover Sunday at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the first visit by a Soviet leader to this 95-percent Roman Catholic country. As the most Catholic nation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is instinctively anti-communist, and 85 percent of the population votes for conservative parties. But it also cherishes the neutrality that kept it out of World War II and makes it the only member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to stay out of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s drive to harmonize its members' policies leads some Irish to worry their neutrality is being compromised, and a visit by the leader of the communist world could help restore the balance. For a country of 3.5 million people still undergoing the transition from a rural to industrial society, even a brief visit from a Soviet leader is a big prestige boost. Irish newspapers Saturday devoted special sections to the visit, which the Irish Times described as confirmation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s `` role as an international statesman.'' The Irish Independent said the visit was both `` significant and symbolic.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, observes that an Irish visit is obligatory for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president but unusual for a Soviet. He said the rare visit will focus attention on `` and probably facilitate the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> charm offensive.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s six-day trip to communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was supposed to follow his visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. But he had to rush home when the Armenian earthquake struck. <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelley </PERSON>, deputy head of <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rianta </ORGANIZATION>, the Irish airports authority, was mindful of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempt to curb Soviet vodka consumption and made tea and coffee available, in addition to Irish whiskey. The visit underlines Irish-Soviet commercial ties, as <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s duty-free stores were open to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rianta </ORGANIZATION> runs the duty-free shops at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Sheremetyevo airport. The symbol of the seven-year joint venture begun last year is a shamrock on the face of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> clock. In 1980, the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> began refueling at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> on North American routes. Now 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jets land at <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> each year and <PERSON> Skelley </PERSON> and his staff are taking Russian lessons. <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rianta </ORGANIZATION> takes over the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> airport shops this summer and has a $ 3.4 million annual contract to paint <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jets. Soviet-Irish trade totaled $ 62.5 billion last year, running 3-1 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s favor. But that was down from $ 75.7 billion in 1987 when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stepped up Irish meat imports.

<HEAD>Alamo Management Battle Pits Hispanics Against `Daughters of Texas
Republic'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 150 years ago, legend has it, <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> commander <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> drew a line across the grounds of the old <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> mission. He asked his men to step over it and defend the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> against thousands of Mexican troops. Today, the Daughters of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who have cared for the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> for 84 years, are emulating <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>' legendary gesture as they battle with legislators and Hispanic leaders who want to wrestle control of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> away from the 6,000-member group. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> lost his battle to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anna </LOCATION> in March 1836, but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> troops rallied with the cry `` Remember the Alamo!'' and later defeated Mexican troops to regain the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' independence from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Now, critics of the Daughters of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> say the mission would be better run by a state agency accountable to the public, particularly in light of an audit that showed the Daughters' Alamo chapter with a budget surplus of nearly $ 2 million. `` We are n't hiding anything. Our books are open and we are complying with the open records and open meetings laws,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, a chapter chairwoman. Tourism officials estimate chapter members usher close to 10 million visitors a year through the mission in the heart of downtown. Shifting control to the state, Ms. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said, would cost taxpayers because state workers would be paid for duties that volunteers now perform. As for the surplus, Ms. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said it was being saved to build a larger theater in the complex. `` We are very proud of what we have done with the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, but we are not bragging about ourselves. Maybe we should,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said. Daughters of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are descendants of people who lived in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> between 1836 and 1845, when it was an independent republic before becoming part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Daughters received a state charter in 1905 to operate the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. The complex includes a chapel with artifacts and flags, a souvenir shop and research library, a small building where documentaries are shown and enclosed grounds with several cannons on display. Admission is free, and operating expenses are covered by souvenir sales profits. No state money is used. Recently, the Daughters asked Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> to clarify their legal status; he ruled that the group must comply with the state open records law because it manages a state-owned site. Meanwhile, state Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> filed a bill that would transfer control of the Alamo from the Daughters to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which operates numerous state parks and museums. `` It's a historical structure, probably the most historical structure in the state, and for the state not to have control or management of it is a little absurd,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee is slated to have a hearing on the bill later this month. Adding fuel to the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> controversy is <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who says he is a descendant of <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, author of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> declaration of independence, maintains the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> is a symbol of oppression for Hispanics. He said the League and the Daughters should work together to see that Hispanic heroes of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> _ Mexicans who fought alongside the other <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> defenders _ are granted the same respect as <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DRT </ORGANIZATION> has a perception that they own the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and because of that they have managed it and handled it in a way that has excluded Hispanics from participating in historical activities,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, 85-year-old descendant of <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, also favors state control of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, though she herself is a member of a Daughters chapter. `` These old girls play dirty politics. The Alamo does n't belong to them ...,'' Ms. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. `` They think they are superior and they are not.'' But supporters of the Daughters, including Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, say the group has done an admirable job of restoring the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and telling the history of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accurately. `` They are blood descendants of the heroes of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. `` No one else will treat either the building or the history of the period with the care and reverence they bring to the task.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who had asked the Daughters to open their records, agrees they take care of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> as no one else could and adds, `` the state is not in a position to be assuming new burdens.'' <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, president of the Daughters' Alamo chapter, said hard work went into making the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> the tourist attraction it is today. `` The older members brought in their husbands, their kids, even their maids to clean the place out,'' she said. `` Where were all these people when we were having such a hard time with it?''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, finally freed of the knockdown, dragged-out fight over the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, is focusing on resolving long-overdue problems such as funding the military in a zero-growth budget and modernizing the nation's land-based missiles. The nearly two-month, bitter debate over Tower, his later rejection by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the eventual confirmation of former Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> has delayed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decisions past set deadlines. In turn, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' defense plate remains relatively empty. `` The ` in box' drives everything,'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview last week Among the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s missed deadlines was a Feb. 15 decision on funding for the single-warhead Midgetman, the mobile, 10-warhead MX missile and other land-based modernization programs as well as budget action due April 3. The delay, according to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, will limit <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> to `` mundane changes'' as he cuts $ 6.3 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense budget originally proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The changes are not going to be very inspired,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` We're facing a brand new era with -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ... but I do n't think we'll see creative thinking.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s abilities but said time constraints and the usual delays in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary's subordinates will limit creativity But Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday he did not envision any problems from the lengthy battle over a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary `` It's not an unreasonable delay nor is it as a result going to create any big problems,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who expects <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to make `` better decisions, decisions with more credibility.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is scheduled to meet next week with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on final changes in the defense budget. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said that if <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> choses to eliminate some military forces rather than cancel weapons in response to budget cuts, the result would be massive force reductions, including six <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> divisions and four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carriers. One of the major choices facing the new <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary is deciding on a modernization plan based on the MX, the Midgetman or a combination of the two. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided last year to authorize $ 850 million in fiscal 1989 to fund the two programs. But until Feb. 15, the Pentagon could spend no more than $ 250 million of the total amount on the MX rail garrison. A compromise plan calls for converting the existing 50 MX missiles from vulnerable silos to railroad cars and building 300 to 500 Midgetman missiles. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said last week that to achieve a bipartisan consensus in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> both the MX and Midgetman should be built. But the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, criticized the plan, saying it would place unacceptable limits on defense programs. He urged his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to vote against the Midgetman unless Democrats agree to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for an increase in defense spending after fiscal 1990. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed zero growth in fiscal 1990, 1 percent growth in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and 2 percent growth in fiscal 1993. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said he feared that the combination of MX and <PERSON> Midgetman </PERSON> will win out. `` It's a very expensive thing to do ... I'm afraid that we'll end up building both Too often that's the way issues will be solved,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat likened the situation to the decision to build the B-1 bombers and move forward with the B-2 stealth bomber after the B-52. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> favored choosing the B-2 over the B-1. `` We've seen huge cost overruns ... as a result of doing everything instead of making choices,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge, citing a lack of evidence, has freed two former military officials and an industrialist jailed three years ago in a highly publicized probe into right-wing kidnappings. Judge <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON> on Friday ordered the release of former Lt. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON>, former Maj. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> and industrialist <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Llovera </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballete </PERSON>. <PERSON> Larios </PERSON> also canceled arrest warrants for five other people, including a former army colonel. The judge declared null the acts of a military judge who in 1986 started the proceedings. The case was transferred to civilian court in 1988 after it was ruled the crimes were not politically motivated. <PERSON> Larrios </PERSON> said statements from witnesses on the kidnappings were not reliable and that there was insufficient evidence to hold the men. The government alleged that <PERSON> Llovera </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON> posed as leftist guerrillas to capture five businessmen in exchange for about $ 5 million between 1980 and 1985. The two were reported to be close friends of cashiered army Maj. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of the ultra-conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The party's candidate, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, won the March 16 presidential election. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> and his associates have been repeatedly linked to right-wing death squads that ran rampant in the country in the early 1980s. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> has denied the charges. When police agents captured <PERSON> Llovera </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON> in March 1986, it was widely viewed as the start of a case that would pit the administration of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> against the conservative sectors of the military. Also implicated in the case were <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION> Tereson Roman, <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriola </PERSON> and detective <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Linates </PERSON>, who all died under suspicious circumstances in the following months. One was found hanged in his jail cell, another was shot when he reportedly tried to escape police custody, and the other was gunned down just outside <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Authorities said the three could have provided important information in the case. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON> also was implicated in the 1981 murders of two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> land advisers _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, Md. _ and a Salvadoran agrarian reform official. The charges against <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON>, who was later dismissed from the army, were dropped because of lack of evidence. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> and Hammer were advising the government on a land reform program that took thousands of acres from wealthy families and distributed them to peasants. Five years later, two former army corporals were convicted in the case. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government later maintained that the `` intellectual authors'' of the crime had not been brought to justice.

 Six years after the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> changed the course of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics, the movement that crowned him mayor has fractured, jeopardizing the brief era of black leadership he set up on City Hall's fifth floor. The likely benefactor of the split is <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the white, three-term <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor who unseated Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the Democratic primary. He heads into Tuesday's election with polls showing him a strong favorite to occupy the office his political boss-father held for 21 years. But if <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> does in fact defeat third-party candidate <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the lone black in the race, and Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, he will have to work fast to consolidate his power in the nation's third largest-city Another election will be held in 1991, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term would have expired. `` One of the first things <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> faced _ and handled well _ was sending a message to the voters that did n't back him,'' said top <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> campaign aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>. `` He told people in the predominantly white communities that his administration was going to be even-handed in distributing services, in appointments and all facets of government ... then went out and did those things. `` <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> the candidate has said many of the same things. And to do less than that, would not only be morally and ethically bankrupt,'' <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> added, `` it would be politically suicidal.'' If <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> were to model himself on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he would in a sense be continuing a tradition. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the city's first black mayor, learned more than a few of his political tricks from the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` The old man liked to say ` Good government is good politics and good politics is good government,''' recalled <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of `` Himself,'' a biography of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. That translated into providing basic services, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> understood, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I'll never forget him walking in the -LRB- white -RRB- ethnic neighborhoods, pointing out broken curbs, busted lights and such, and telling people, ` I'd fix this, but your alderman is blocking the way,''' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> added. `` Sheer genius.'' But while <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> would have to reassure blacks that he intended to treat them fairly, he might also have his hands full keeping his white constituency happy. `` While everybody is wondering whether the black political movement can be put back together, what's been overlooked is the high price that loyalty will cost <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> if he wins,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the author of `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Divided: The Making of a Black Mayor.'' `` He's got to keep his own troops in line, nurture the split among blacks, and get some votes in the City Council,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> added. `` And nothing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics comes cheap.'' To be sure, however, the constraints on Tuesday's winner go beyond the moral, the ethical and even the purely political. For one thing, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did n't so much dominate his <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> opposition as outlast it. For the first three years of his first term, an anti-Washington bloc of aldermen thwarted his legislative agenda at nearly every turn. It was only after a court-ordered remap increased minority representation in the council that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was able to put together a working majority. Either <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> or <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> could command about 20 votes each in the council, but <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is more likely to succeed in twisting the arms of the remaining 10 aldermen. Another factor limiting the new mayor will be the paucity of spoils that can be handed out. During the six-term reign of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s father, the mayor exercised control over 40,000 patronage jobs. Federal court rulings since the 1970s have prohibited most political hiring and firing, which means the next mayor will have fewer than 1,000 jobs to dole out to his army. And the mayor's control over another traditional source of spoils _ contracts for city services and consultants' fees _ has been limited by increasing council review powers and a set of executive guidelines laid down by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that guarantee minorities a representative share. But neither promises of fairness nor constraints assuage all the fears in the black community. `` Nothing less than the future of blacks in politics in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is being threatened. I wo n't beat around the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>. I want a black mayor,'' said <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, the popular black radio commentator and political activist. After months of avoiding the potentially explosive issue of race, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> wandered closer toward the minefield last week in hopes of energizing black voters in a city where the voting population is about 48 percent white against 42 percent black. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is getting ready to reopen his father's plantation,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a South Side alderman, told a rally of 12,000 supporters gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> early last week <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> lost the Feb. 28 primary in large part because many black supporters of <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> stayed away from the polls. The two men had become bitter rivals during the council fight to appoint a temporary successor to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As a result, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> drew nearly 130,000 fewer votes in the city's 19 predominantly black wards than <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did in the 1987 primary. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> by a margin of just over 100,000 votes. The most recent polls show <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> with about 50 percent support and with a lead of between 14 and 21 points over <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, whose upstart, write-in candidacy a week before the primary won him the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, is mired at about 5 percent support and not considered a factor. A <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> victory would make <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by far the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city to replace black control of City Hall with white. `` To know that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> would finish out <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>'s reign would be unthinkable,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` But to know that blacks, on the very anniversary of Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination, would be so immobilized that we ca n't get enough people out on our own day to assure our freedom would show,'' he added, `` that we get what we deserve.

 A bookstore offering a deal on film processing prompted <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mixdorf </LOCATION> to take in theirs _ all 108 rolls shot over 16 years. The <PERSON> Mixdorfs </PERSON> said that through the years they've had just enough money to buy film, but never enough to pay for processing. They just kept storing the film in bags in a closet. The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION> offered a special last week of $ 1.99 for any number of exposures on a roll, compared with the usual $ 4.99 for 24 exposures or $ 6.99 for 36.

 Pinning down and correcting the cause of the nation's worst oil spill may be as difficult as cleaning up after it. The federal inquiry into why the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> is inhibited by the time it took to get authorities onto the ship, delays in taking urine and blood samples from key personnel, and the refusal of two top officers to talk to investigators. Among important questions investigators have been unable to answer: _ Why the southbound ship, which had radioed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that it was moving out of its own shipping lane to avoid an iceberg, moved across both the separation lane and the northbound traffic lane into a charted reef just after midnight March 24 _ Why the third mate who was unqualified to pilot the 987-foot tanker through the sound was put in charge while the captain, who was qualified, had left the bridge _ Whether the captain, who was determined to be drinking 11 hours after the accident, also was drinking when it occurred The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> arrived 2 -LCB- hours after the vessel ran aground and started spilling oil into the once pristine waters. Blood and urine tests of the ship's officers were not completed until nearly 11 hours after the accident. And investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were not on board until two full days after the ship ran aground. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the time it took to get <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers to the ship appeared to be reasonable given the late hour and the 25-mile distance to the ship from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. According to communications logs sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> received first word of the 12:04 a.m. -LRB- local time -RRB- accident at 12:28 a.m. and within two minutes ordered <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> closed to all traffic and dispatched the commercial tug Stalwart to assist the oil-spewing tanker. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers left <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> for the ship at 1 a.m. and arrived at about 2:30. Urine and blood tests of the captain, the third mate, the helmsman and a lookout could n't be conducted before qualified personnel were available to conduct them, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Only the captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, tested positive, with a .061 alcohol content in his blood. A level of .04 would disqualify him from operating the ship. In most states, an auto driver is considered drunk only at a substantially higher blood alcohol content _ typically .10 or higher. For an average-size man, the consumption of one beer within an hour of the test likely would show up at about the .03 - to -.04 level, meaning a person has to drink three or more beers or equivalent drinks in most states to be considered legally drunk for the purposes of driving a Board spokeswoman <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said investgators have no way of detecting from blood tests whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was drunk or even drinking at the time of the collision. They determined, based on interviews with other crew members, that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had turned over the bridge to his third mate, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>. But they have not been able to tell whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s blood alcohol level was due to drinking before or after the accident. If the test result stemmed from drinking prior to the accident, he would have had a higher count if tested within minutes after the ship ran aground. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, citing violation of company rules that prohibit alcohol on board company ships. But Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, said investigators had been unable to determine whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> or anyone actually had alcohol on board. `` By the time we got there Sunday morning, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials had moved into the captain's cabin to set up a crisis command, and any evidence that was there would have been of no use,'' she said. Both <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> and Cousins have refused to talk on the advice of lawyers, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and civilian authorities have said they are considering action against them. Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the board could subpoena the men but investigators could not provide them with any immunity without approval of the full five-member safety board and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She said both men had tried to make a deal that would protect them from prosecution early in the investigation. The safety board has no power to bring charges or compel actions but only determines the probable cause of an accident and recommends steps to prevent future accidents involving shipping, aviation or ground transportation. Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the board expected to complete its field investigation early this week, after several more interviews and an examination of ship personnel records to determine the competence of its officers and crew. In addition to cause of the accident, the board also is looking at initial response to the spill and will assess the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s monitoring of traffic in the port `` to make the passage of vessels to and from port as safe from human error as possible. Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the tanker had received <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> permission to go around the ice, but there was no indication of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> error in directives given to the ship. A civilian worker in a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> radar room in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> where the tanker was being monitored had a blood-alcohol level of 0.20 when he was tested 15 hours after the accident. But Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the worker, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON>, had come on duty only a few minutes before the accident and said he drank only after getting off work 12 hours later.

 Syrian forces fired shells at a key power plant in the Christian heartland Saturday, and artillery and rocket duels with Christian troops raged on despite a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire call. Police said one person died and 12 were wounded. Firefighters controlled a blaze at a fuel depot hit by rockets in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> last week, and 150,000 evacuees were told they could return home. But radio stations often interrupted programming with warnings to residents to stay in bomb shelters. Christian sources said the Syrians were planning to escalate the fighting and had brought in from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> new artillery and rocket batteries. They accused the Syrians of seeking to demolish key public utilities in the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave, which includes east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and nearby communities northeast of the city. At least 130 people have died and 421 have been wounded in the latest round of battles in the 14-year civil war. The fighting erupted March 8 after Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> tried to blockade militia-run ports that deprive the government of revenue. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, opposed by a rival Moslem Cabinet backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the Christians' main radio station, said Syrian gunners `` intentionally ignored'' Friday's cease-fire plea by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Voice of the Nation, Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s most popular station, said: `` All attempts to arrange a cease-fire have failed. Civilians have no option but to remain huddled in basements.'' A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian heartland with howitzers and multi-barreled rocket launchers throughout the day. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000-strong army retaliated by firing 155mm howitzer shells into Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, Druse-held mountains southeast of the capital and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley. A <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several Syrian-fired 180mm howitzer shells exploded around the main power station in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Zouk </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before dawn. A fire at a fuel depot in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian district of <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> caused by Syrian shelling was `` fizzling out,'' according to <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Honein </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. The fire began when a shell hit the depot Monday. A large butane gas explosion Thursday was set off by another shell. <PERSON> Honein </PERSON> said the estimated 150,000 people who evacuated the densely populated district could return to their homes. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s president, Ambassador <PERSON> Absa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Diallo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, made a cease-fire appeal Friday. The Arab League on Tuesday called for a truce, and a <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared a unilateral cease-fire declaration on Wednesday. The political crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had been escalating since Sept. 22, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, to head an interim Cabinet after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new president. Moslems rejected the appointment which violated a national covenant under which presidents are <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>, premiers Sunnis and house speakers Shiite Moslems. They pledged allegiance to <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who now heads the rival <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>North Strategy Appears Unchanged Despite Ruling on Reagan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ruled out as a witness, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers must look for other ways to show that his superiors authorized his actions in the Iran-Contra affair. The defense begins presenting its case Monday at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on charges ranging from lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to receiving an illegal gratuity. While prosecutors were presenting their side over the last six weeks, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers brought out a number of secret actions taken by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> while in the White House on behalf of the Contra rebels fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. But that failed to persuade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should be called to the stand as requested by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. On Friday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> declared that `` the trial record presently contains no proof that defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON> ever received any authorization from President <PERSON> Reaan </PERSON> to engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing.'' That represented a blow to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s strategy but is not expected to deter his lawyers from focusing on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They still may draw on secrets contained in a 44-page admission by the government, outlining the administration's inducements to other countries in exchange for help to the Contras. In addition, they are expected to zero in on exhibits already presented at the trial suggesting authorization. For example, after <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied in an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he was aiding the Contras, then-national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> wrote his subordinate: `` Well done.'' North now is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the meeting. The defense subpoenaed <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, a co-defendant in the Iran-Contra case who will be tried separately from North later this year. Asserting his constitutional rights, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is declining to appear. In his absence, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers want to show several hours of televised testimony <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> gave on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in 1987 during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> testified that his one regret was that he did n't follow up personally after <PERSON> North </PERSON> reported a threat on his life by terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> Part of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense to the charge of accepting an illegal gratuity, a home security system, is that he feared for his family's safety and that the government would n't pay for a security system. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> opposes introducing the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> videotape. The problem with focusing on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers have been unable to place him at the scene of any of the alleged crimes. The closest brush to date involving the president came in the testimony of former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said he had talked with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Oval Office about congressional inquiries before sending letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in September 1985 which denied North was assisting the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> later pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in connection with the letters, which <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of preparing and for which he is now charged with felonies. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified that he got no guidance from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on what to say in the letters, but <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said they needed to question the president about the matter. North's lawyers also tried to show a pattern of concealment from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It was disclosed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who told the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 he did n't know about <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> involvement with the Contras, followed through on recommendations from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff to help the rebels. During a two-year congressional ban on Contra aid, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed off on a secret plan to provide $ 110 million in extra aid to entice <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to support the Contras. In response to a memo from <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also telephoned the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to get a military shipment destined for the Contras released. It had been seized earlier in the day by the Honduran military. Testimony at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial also shows that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also apparently approved a secret airdrop of recoilless rifles and other items to the Contras. The rifles were to be used to destroy two arms-bearing ships headed for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified that when he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> government contribution to the Contras, `` he made clear to me that no one should know and let's keep it that way.''

 Moslem countries are building up long-range missile arsenals in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including systems capable of carrying nuclear and chemical warheads to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, military analysts say. Four Arab countries _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ now possess missiles capable of hitting targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. All except <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> are capable of producing their own chemical weapons, analysts and diplomats say. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> said last week the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> missile race is eroding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s traditional aerial supremacy and could `` dramatically change the balance of power'' in the region. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said that in addition to the four Arab countries that have missiles, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is `` rushing to catch up.'' At a time of East-West detente and arms reductions, military developments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> have rung alarm bells in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> warned recently of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> arms race that `` sooner or later would degenerate into a nuclear face-off.'' Arab states in the region are pressing ahead with major arms programs costing billions of dollars, but analysts do not believe the missile spread has reached a critical stage yet. `` The real question is what kind of warheads these missiles are going to carry. High explosive and chemical warheads basically cause very localized damage,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said the countries do not have enough missiles to ensure that they could hit all targets and prevent retaliation. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> disclosed last year it has acquired Chinese-made DF-3A ballistic missiles. They have a range of 1,600 miles and can carry a 1.3-megaton nuclear weapon or a warhead containing 4,500 pounds of high explosive. The Saudis insist the missiles, the most powerful in the region, will only carry conventional warheads. Intended primarily as defense against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the missiles can also easily reach Israeli targets. Missile warfare in the region started during the 1973 <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. The Iran-Iraq war spurred the spread of missile acquisition. The use of outlawed chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> conflict made the Israelis more aware than ever of the nightmare they faced in any new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have Soviet Scud-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 180 miles. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe, has more than 100 Scud-Bs. It also has an estimated 36 of the more accurate and powerful Soviet SS-21 Scarab tactical missiles, which have a range of 120 miles and are capable of carrying chemical warheads. These can reach key Israeli targets. The Syrians also have Soviet-built SS-C-1 Sepal and SS-C-3 anti-ship missiles. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has some Chinese-made Silkworm surface-to-ship missiles and appears determined to build a missile arsenal to match <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s efforts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has long held the offensive edge in the volatile <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> through its vaunted air force, and it is widely believed to have built up a stock of nuclear weapons. The superpowers' influence in restricting access to missile technology has been undercut by the emergence of sophisticated arms industries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have become major arms exporters. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are the main producers in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are building up their own defense industries, even though their technological capabilities are still limited. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are working with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to develop the Badr-2000 missile with a 620-mile range and a warhead that can contain explosives, a nuclear device or poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is reported to be negotiating with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to buy Oteiba MB @ EE-600 missiles with a range of 375 miles, enough to hit Israeli targets. The Israelis are believed to be seeking to counter the growing threat by developing missile systems to either knock out Arab and Iranian missile sites in preemptive strikes or destroy incoming missiles in the air. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that some <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources believe <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has a program to build nuclear warheads for use with missiles. Analysts say that so far the arsenal is limited, both in quantity and quality, although they noted that any large-scale acquisitions, particularly by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, would cause alarm. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said: `` For the time being, these weapons are being sought by people for essentially defensive purposes. These states want to be listened to.'' The key question is whether <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ever achieve nuclear weapons status. Most analysts believe that prospect is still distant. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has called for an Arab nuclear capability and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have nuclear reactors or are building them. `` The Arabs worry about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as an advanced and dangerous outsider in the region,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said. But he said they are wary of missile encounters with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has its own nuclear-capable Jericho-1 weapon, with an estimated range of up to 370 miles, and has tested an advanced version with a reputed range of more than 1,000 miles. `` Arab states know that if they started firing missiles at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, they run the risk of nuclear retaliation,'' he said.

 State authorities filed criminal charges against a tanker captain accusing him of operating his ship under the influence of alcohol, while the nation's worst oil spill spread into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fired Exxon Valdez Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> on Thursday, the same day the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> revealed blood and urine tests taken about nine hours after the accident showed he had been drinking. On Friday, the state charged <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> with three misdemeanors and issued a warrant for his arrest, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, was charged with operating a motorcraft while under the influence, reckless endangerment and the negligent discharge of oil. The three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two years and three months, and fines totaling up to $ 10,000. If convicted, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> would have to spend at least 30 days in jail because he has two prior drunken driving convictions in the past five years, <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said. Magistrate <PERSON> Tracee </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnell </PERSON> signed the arrest warrant for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, and set bond at $ 50,000. Authorities believe <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> left the state several days ago, but <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said the state would seek his extradition. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is looking at possible felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the `` negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters.'' The state is also investigating. The 240,000 barrels of oil that spewed into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> a week ago from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> has now tainted more than 1,000 square miles of water. Norwegian environmental specialists were en route to advise cleanup crews, and wildlife officials feared taht the number of oil-slicked birds and sea animals would overwhelm a local recovery center. The iridescent slick began seeping into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Friday, threatening additional fishing communities and a 600-mile stretch of coastline that includes a national park. Workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Kenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fjords </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> hustled to protect fertile salmon streams draining <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s rocky underbelly. `` We expect the windward side of our boundary ... to be slimed,'' said park Superintendent <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Costellina </PERSON>. `` There's not a lot we can do about it.'' Ten sea otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> for cleaning, and federal wildlife experts said more than 1,000 tainted birds _ some alive, some dead _ had been spotted on a single island. Workers in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> hurried to build cages for an expected flood of oil-soaked otters at a wildlife recovery and rehabilitation center set up at <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. But officials expressed concerned that the center could n't handle a burgeoning number of oil-soaked animals. `` A thousand oiled live and dead birds in the whole scheme of things probably is not that significant,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson-Wilson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's only one place in the sound There may be many other places in the sound that bad that people have n't gotten to yet.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game estimated the sound's otter population at 4,000 to 5,000 and said the otter is the area's most plentiful marine Other marine mammals found in the sound year-round include sea lions, harbor seals, porpoises and killer whales. Meanwhile, the mayor of this picturesque coastal community said Friday the ruptured tanker should be repaired elsewhere to prevent further contamination. Also Friday, angry residents, many of them fishermen who depend on the sea for their livelihoods, disrupted <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s daily news briefing, demanding to know why the company that owns the tanker is not hiring them for the cleanup work. A sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because of the spill. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s office announced that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is planning to send a skimming ship next week to help in the cleanup. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the disabled <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> no longer was leaking oil, but it could do so again when the vessel is moved. Although about two-thirds of the 1 million barrels of oil that remained aboard have been removed, the ship could be carrying up to 50,000 barrels of oil and up to 600,000 barrels of oily bilge water when refloating is tried, possibly Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has the area's only port capable of handling the 987-foot ship that has been impaled on a reef 25 miles away since March 24. `` If they bring that tanker in here leaking oil, then we're going to have oil in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> said, adding that ducks, geese, wetlands and a fish hatchery could be threatened <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for not hiring townspeople to help in the cleanup and accused the company of pressuring residents `` to settle their claims hurriedly.'' The company said that it had established an emergency assistance fund, and that users were not precluded from making future claims. The outburst at Friday's news conference broke up the briefing as security guards struggled with environmentalists trying to force their way in. The audience kept interrupting the proceedings with shouted questions and accusations. Before the session disintegrated into chaos, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> denied a reporter's suggestion that the spill has gotten out of control and the cleanup has been a failure. `` Absolutely not, it has not gotten away from us,'' <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> insisted. `` We are making good progress on this cleanup.'' But he said later that only 300,000 of the more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled have been recovered. Exxon Shipping President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said that `` most skimming equipment is inefficient'' because of the changing consistency of the oil, which he likened to `` black mayonnaise.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the president of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> today to press ahead with his nation's economic reforms as the administration pushed its new plan to curb social and economic tensions over the Third World debt crisis. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House breakfast session with <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, was `` very productive,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. They were joined in their 1 -LCB- - hour meeting by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastorino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state-designate The group dicussed the debt crisis plaguing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and other Third World countries and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> described the economic reforms underway in his coiuntry, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` encouraged them to continue with the reform effort,'' he added. They also talked about the administration's new plan to aid the Contras in the efforts to bring about peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> that he wants to keep diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to implement democratic reforms, and he asked <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s support for that effort, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said he had no further details of the meeting. The meeting came as the administration was looking to the spring meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, starting this weekend here, for approval of its new plan to help Third World nations ease their crushing $ 1.3 trillion debt burden. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the sessions, which are attended by the finance ministers and other influential officials of the twin international lending organizations' 151 member nations. In the 7-year-old crisis, the burden of paying interest on $ 1.3 trillion that developing nations owe has sapped their economies, lowered living standards and led to growing political and economic unrest. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, blamed riots in his country last month that claimed 270 lives on `` intolerable and obscene'' debt repayment terms imposed by creditors. He called on wealthier nations to do more to relieve the debt burden. Critics have complained that the administration plan _ named for <LOCATION> Brady </LOCATION> _ has raised unreasonable expectations for debt relief in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and may end up fomenting political instability instead of helping relieve tensions. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named said the administration saw <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> as vital to selling the debt-reduction process. `` He views himself as a leader in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the official said. `` Here is a president with the blood of nearly 300 people to deal with, and he's pretty courageous to stand by his economic reforms.'' A second <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official said, `` If we get support on the debt program from Perez ... I think it will be a success.'' Preliminary discussions began on Friday with a meeting of finance officials representing debtor countries. On Sunday, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is hosting daylong discussions with the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's largest industrial countries. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt plan is expected to be the principal topic on the agenda. These talks, involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, will take place at <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, an estate along the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> which once belonged to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. The administration is looking for an endorsement of the new strategy so that the major creditor countries will present a united front when the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan is taken up at the Monday and Tuesday sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, commercial banks would be asked to forgive voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor nations. In return, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would provide assurances that the remaining debt would be repaid. The administration has estimated that over the next three years its proposals could result in wiping out about $ 70 billion of the $ 340 billion in debt owed by 39 developing nations, a group which includes all of the largest debtors and many of the smaller ones. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would be expected to contribute about $ 12 billion each over three years to spur the debt reduction effort. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also looking to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and other countries which are running large trade surpluses, to recycle some of that money into debt relief. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is expected to contribute between $ 5 billion and $ 10 billion.

<HEAD>Iran Restarts Big Abadan Refinery After 8-Year Wartime Shutdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> resumed partial operations Saturday at its war-battered <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> oil refinery after an eight-year shutdown during the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Since the Aug. 20 cease-fire, 7,000 technicians and specialists have worked round-the-clock to rebuild the 3,200-acre complex, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>, only a few miles from the Iraqi border and within sight of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> artillery throughout the war, was knocked out early in the conflict that began in September 1980. It was shelled almost daily, and 158 refinery personnel were killed in the fighting. The cost of the damage and lost production was estimated at more than $ 9 billion. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> inaugurated the newly built <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> plant in southwest <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. He told the technicians who rebuilt a 20-megawatt power plant, distillation towers, storage tanks and other facilities from the twisted ruins: `` You ... have proved that the Iranian nation, by relying on itself, can emerge as a wonderful power.'' The 70-year-old refinery will start with a daily production capacity of 130,000 barrels a day, one-fifth of its pre-war capacity, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. But Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, was quoted as saying production will be boosted over the next two to three years to 360,000 barrels daily. The reopening of the <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> complex came amid a major effort by the Iranians to rebuild their battered oil industry and their refineries, which were heavily bombed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s powerful air force throughout the war. <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>'s output will boost <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refinery capacity to an estimated 850,000 barrels a day. Six other refineries have been repaired since the cease-fire. Most are operating 25 percent above their designated capacities to boost production of refined products such as fuel oil and kerosene. Oil industry experts consider the speed with which the Iranians have restored their oil installations since the cease-fire to be a major development. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, editor of the respected Nicosia-based Middle East Economic Survey who visited Iranian oil installations a few weeks ago, noted that the reconstruction was `` a considerable achievement.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s crude oil exports are the mainstay of its economy and account for some 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings.

 Thai pirates massacred 45 Vietnamese refugees sailing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and kidnapped about 11 women on the boat, officials on Saturday quoted two survivors as saying. The pirates slashed the passengers with knives and threw them overboard before running their boat over the floating bodies to make sure no one was alive, they said. An old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack that occurred within the past week, said the officials, who work with refugees and who spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity.

The refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full account of their experience. They did not say exactly when the attack took place or how many pirates took part. There was no word on the fate of the kidnapped women. `` The women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into the sea or abandoned in remote islands,'' said another refugee official. In January, refugee officials said two <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> women were raped and dumped on a remote Thai island before arriving at the camp. The women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed by Thai pirates late last year. The government reported that in March, about 2,000 Vietnamese refugees landed on <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> shores, almost double the average for the past few months. There are now about 16,500 Vienamese boat people in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the nations of the region accept the refugees only for temporary stay pending permanent settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

 Moslem guerrillas, bolstered by newly arrived reinforcements, intensified their rocket and artillery attacks on the government-held city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Guerrilla bombardments on Thursday and Friday killed 69 civilians and wounded 123, the government said. It was one of the highest civilian death tolls reported since the U.S.-backed guerrillas launched their offensive March 6 in an effort to oust government troops from the city 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The siege began less than three weeks after the last Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after nine years of support for successive regimes in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, reported eight deaths and 27 injuries among government troops and said 109 opposition fighters were killed and 70 wounded. Most of the figures could not be verified, but members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> religious minority who arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday said 22 people were killed Thursday in a Sikh Gurdwara, or temple, in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. They said hundreds of people had taken refuge in the Gurdwara as rocket and shell fire intensified, and they said few people were venturing outside. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 12,000 to 14,000 opposition fighters, including what he said were `` Pakistani militiamen in Afghan costume,'' were attacking <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> early in the week and an additional 3,500 men had joined them by Saturday. He said the new fighters came from <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> provinces, which are southwest of <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province where <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is located. He did not say how many government soldiers were defending the city. The government spokesman said the opposition on Thursday fired 16,000 shells and rockets at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and that 2,500 of them fell in residential areas and destroyed 13 houses. On Friday, he said, 900 more rockets and shells hit residential aras, destroying 43 houses. He did not give a total number of rounds fired on all targets Friday. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also read a Foreign Ministry statement accusing the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, of trying to reimpose British colonialism on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> through its support for the Moslem insurgency. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> met Moslem guerrilla leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> last week. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Friday, he said only a broad-based Afghan government will bring peace. He said he found the guerrilla leaders were willing `` to work for a government that will command a wide acceptance inside the country.'' But he said such a government must not be imposed on the Afghan people. On Feb. 23, the guerrillas met in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and elected a provisional government they hope will replace President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his Soviet-style <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Thousands of people have fled <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since the fighting started, and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government says it does not know how many remain in the city. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> had a population of 200,000 a decade ago, but it generally was thought to have shrunk to less than half that number before the guerrilla offensive started. The city is key for the insurgents, for it would give them a base on Afghan soil to set up their provisional government.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is under mounting pressure to swiftly pass President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry, but a dispute over accounting artistry threatens to knock the plan off the fast track. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking committees, after six weeks of hearings, begin writing their own versions of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation this week. Democrats on the House panel are meeting privately Tuesday in preparation for public drafting sessions beginning two days later. Senators are also gathering behind closed doors this week, before starting open meetings April 13. `` I expect to see -LRB- the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal -RRB- adopted without major surgery ... -LRB- and -RRB- on the president's desk by May,'' said consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Issac </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Quick movement is nearly unprecedented for a major piece of legislation dealing with the financial system and the host of special interest groups representing its segments, but this time fear is a driving force S & amp; L depositors are withdrawing their funds in record amounts _ $ 35 billion from November through February _ and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are afraid to risk further deterioration. S & amp; L regulators at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> say the huge withdrawals are not abnormal when interest rates rise and mutual funds and other competitors offer investors a better return. However, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and the White House budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, are telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that depositors are nervous because the president's plan is n't in place. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> used several speeches last week _ in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ to press the administration claim that `` we will continue to see withdrawals as long as our plan is not enacted into law.'' Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, even those with reservations about the plan, are inclined to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what he wants and try to sidestep political blame if things go wrong. If the plan works, then it was <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that passed it. If it does n't, then it's the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. But other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are looking to put their mark on the bill. Administration officials fear the most likely target will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s complex scheme to keep $ 50 billion in bailout money out of the budget deficit by creating a new government corporation to sell bonds. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, say they can save more than $ 4 billion in interest costs by borrowing the $ 50 billion through regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds They would carry a lower interest rate than the special off-budget bonds, which also would be backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, but in a less direct fashion. The Riegle-Schumer plan would balloon the budget deficit for the current fiscal year ending Sept. 30, but it would avoid the automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law because all of the 1989 deficit target deadlines have expired. Administration officials view this as a thinly disguised Democratic attempt to bust Gramm-Rudman, creating a precedent for big spending increases for other programs and ruining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chances of keeping his no-new-taxes pledge They argue that their own, off-budget, evasion of Gramm-Rudman is harder to duplicate. Another dispute, this one an intra-Republican squabble between the administration and Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the banking panel, had loomed as a potential roadblock. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, whose former top aide, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has enjoyed great influence at the bank board, an independent agency. The administration wants to transfer the bank board's deposit insurance fund to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which already insures accounts at commercial banks, and wrap the remainder of the agency into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> is adamantly opposed to allowing what he calls `` the gnomes of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' perceived to be more sympathetic to the interests of big banks and Wall Street than to S & amp; Ls, to get their clutches on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L agency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers are n't budging. They say that if taxpayers are asked to bail out the industry, then an executive branch department, directly responsible to elected officials, must control the regulators. A potential compromise would put the regulatory functions of the bank board into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but leave its financing aspects independent. The board's 12 regional banks borrow money on Wall Street at low interest rates, funneling it to small and medium-sized S & amp; Ls that do n't have the clout to get the low rates on their own. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides predict <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> will take the deal because he does n't want to hold up the legislation and he faces several not-so-subtle threats if he does n't go along. The administration, if it was inclined, could go along with a push by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to force Wall to undergo reconfirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The other big battle will be over the administration's proposal to force <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to meet tougher capital standards, 6 percent instead of 3 percent, by June 1991. Capital represents the money an S & amp; L's owners have invested. Owners required to risk more of their own money before federal deposit insurance kicks in are likely to manage more carefully.

 The curious, the devout and the doubting <PERSON> Thomases </PERSON> are flocking by the hundreds to a Roman Catholic church to gaze upon a life-size crucifix, whose once-open eyes reportedly closed during a Good Friday service. `` I brought everyone who could fit in my car,'' said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrelli </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION>, who drove about 40 miles with two children and five other adults to this <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> mill town on Friday. `` I wanted to be as close as I could be, and I wanted my children to experience it too. I truly believe it was a miracle,'' she said. Since Easter, when the Good Friday occurrence was reported in the media, more than 1,000 people from several states have been visiting the Holy Trinity Church each day, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cvitkovic </PERSON>, the church pastor. The parking lot has been continually full, and there's a constant stream of traffic on the narrow, brick street in front of the white church 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuerl </PERSON>, head the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> diocese of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said church officials are withholding judgment on the event until they can complete an investigation. But many of the worshipers say that, miracle or not, they feel better after gazing at the luminescent statue suspended on a cross 15 feet above the altar. `` It's touching. You feel cleansed,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON>, 66, of nearby <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>. `` I feel a little bit calmer within myself,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Zbihley </PERSON>, 51, also of <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>. `` It just made my faith a little bit stronger.'' The downcast eyes, which now appear as small slits that conceal the pupils, were about one-third open when the plaster crucifix was moved in January from a corner of the church where it hung at eye-level. It was suspended in a more prominent position in front of a modern stained-glass window depicting a resurrected Christ. <PERSON> Cvitkovic </PERSON> said he often pointed out the crucifix to his congregation of 300 families, saying it was unusual in that it depicted a still-living <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, with open eyes and mouth. <PERSON> Domenic </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON>, an artist who helped restore the 58-year-old statue in January and had touched up the eyes with acrylic paint, confirmed the eyes were open when the crucifix was hung. But during a three-hour prayer meeting on Good Friday, worshipers noticed the eyes had almost closed. <PERSON> Cvitkovic </PERSON> said it would be nearly impossible for someone to have tampered with the crucifix because the church is locked when services are not held. `` I do n't know how to explain it,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coraopolis </LOCATION>, who attended the Good Friday prayer meeting. `` It was like electricity running through you. It was an overwhelming experience. Tears came to me.'' A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> prayer group, which studies the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s reported manifestations in the small <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION>, claimed he then received a spiritual message while on his knees praying following the service. Those who have come to Holy Trinity since the Good Friday event sit quietly, hands folded and eyes transfixed on the crucifix. Some, like <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Paonessa </PERSON> who brought her 4-year-old deaf daughter, seek religious healing. `` She can use all the help she can get through the Blessed Mother,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Paonessa </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sharpsburg </LOCATION>. Some people are clearly moved, breaking into tears, while others come only out of curiosity. `` I'm kind of skeptical,'' said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` People want miracles because of all the unhappiness in the world.''

 The makers of a South African anti-war film have decided not to release it in this country after censors ordered 48 cuts. The film, `` The Stick,'' is based loosely on the undeclared border war fought by South African forces in recent years in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. It has been shown at several international film festivals and is scheduled to open commercially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in May.

The film makers said the censors ordered 48 cuts, barred anyone under 21 fron seeing the movie, and ruled that it could only be shown in theaters with fewer than 200 seats. `` ` The Stick' is a film that should be seen by South Africans,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` However, the number of excisions ordered would reduce the film to a simple exploitation picture and destroy the impact and power that it has now.''

The board represents the 151 governments that own the bank, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>'s agreement was with <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the Frenchman who is managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the same 151-member nations. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said the accord provides the fund with authority over `` aggregate macroeconomic policy,'' which gives the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> the leading role in deciding how loans may affect the economy of a borrowing country. The agreement also leaves a loophole for the bank to continue to make certain nondevelopment project loans. The agreement seeks to end problems such as the one that cropped up last October when the two international lending organizations clashed heads over a loan to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Man Confesses To Wife's Death 12 Years Ago</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man has confessed to killing his wife 12 years ago in what authorities at the time thought was a traffic accident. A confession by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, 55, of <PERSON> Humptulips </PERSON> was contained in sworn statements unsealed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Grays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. According to the documents, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he was driven by guilt to approach county authorities two weeks ago and admit that he killed his wife in a fight. `` I had no right to take her life,'' he said. `` She was making my life so miserable that I had to get rid of her,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> told sheriff's deputies in his confession. `` I decided I was going to enjoy my life a little bit and just lay her in the ground where she belonged.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> was arrested Friday for investigation of murder. He was being held in the county jail pending a decision by county Prosecutor <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> <PERSON> Menefree </PERSON> on whether to file charges. Earlier this week, the county sheriff's office exhumed the body of <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, who was 40 when she died in 1976. An autopsy was conducted by the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, and results have been sent to <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> authorities. In statements to police, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> described himself as driven by a rage because `` my wife would do nothing for me, but she expected everything from me.'' He said he has now realized his anger `` was n't a sane way of thinking.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said that on the evening of Nov. 28, 1976, he asked his wife to accompany him to a tavern in <LOCATION> Humptulips </LOCATION>, 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, for a drink. They went, and each had a drink, but `` she would n't talk to me,'' he said. The couple returned home, but <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said his wife refused to come inside, `` so I started after her.'' `` I grabbed her by the coat front and hit her,'' he said. `` As far as I know, it broke her jaw and knocked her unconscious. She fell, and I was still in such a rage that I got down alongside of her. I guess I straddled her and started strangling her.'' As his wife's breathing became fainter, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he `` got to feeling sorry for her,'' and tried to revive her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. He decided to take her to a hospital, but changed his mind on the way. `` I thought if I took her to the hospital she could take me to a court of law to have me put away for being violent,'' he said. Instead, he drove down an isolated road, where he decided to `` wreck the car to either kill us both or to see if one of us was worth saving.'' He floored the accelerator and crashed the car into a bank of the twisting road. When <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> came to, he was slumped over the wheel. He noticed a cut on his forehead, he told deputies. His wife had been thrown 10 feet from the car. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he approached where she lay and heard `` a rasping breath and she quit breathing.'' Had she not died at the scene, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> later told police, he would have `` taken a tire iron and beat her to death.'' A court affidavit said investigating officers at the time accepted <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s explanation of the accident, and no autopsy was conducted, even though his wife had indicated to a minister she feared for her life. Menefree, the county prosecutor, said the autopsy confirmed <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s description of the fight. He declined to give specifics, but said autopsy results `` fit into the whole puzzle we're piercing together.''

<HEAD>Independent Culture Meeting Marks End of Underground Era</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Underground writers and publishers rubbed elbows Saturday with critics, actors and film makers in a coming-out celebration of independent culture, seven years after the icy chill of martial law. The festive and animated gathering in a packed <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> auditorium reflected the thaw taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this spring during talks between the Solidarity-led opposition and the communist authorities. `` I never dreamed ... that an official meeting would be held for the outstanding creators of Polish culture and activists of the second circulation _ publishers, journalists, editors, printers, distributors and workers in the conspiracy,'' said publisher <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Boguta </PERSON> in a letter to the meeting. `` Has the moment finally arrived in which it is not necessary to fight with the secret police, censorship and state administration for the freedom to create?'' asked <PERSON> Boguta </PERSON>, who acknowledged five months ago that he was the director of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest underground publishing house. The Independent Culture Forum was organized by the culture commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory group set up last year by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> that functions as a sort of grand council of the Polish opposition. It was convened by commission chairman <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leading filmmaker Before the hundreds of people attending the forum, composer-conductor <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutoslawski </PERSON> called for the approval of a charter requesting freedom of association for creative artists and freedom in libraries, television, film studios and bookstores. Talks between Solidarity and the government that started Feb. 6 aim at speeding the growth of `` pluralism'' to replace official monopolies in politics, labor unions and the economy. Participants at Saturday's meeting made clear that such pluralism also must replace any official monopoly on culture. Although authorities in recent years have eased censorship and shown a degree of tolerance for illegal publishers, <PERSON> Boguta </PERSON> noted that some people in the movement would continue to keep their identities hidden as long as any repressions and censorship exist. `` The proper places for books are not the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s warehouses, but in bookstores, libraries and private collections,'' he said Outside the auditorium, independent publishing houses set up tables where they sold uncensored works by officially out-of-favor Polish authors or emigre writers. One popular seller was the paperback underground edition of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s autobiography, `` The Way of Hope,'' which has never been officially published in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Kansas Official Files for Bankruptcy to Halt Salary Garnishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> filed for bankruptcy in federal court, saying he could n't pay a $ 200,000 judgment awarded to a former employee who sued him for sexual harassment. He said Friday that garnishment of one-fourth of his $ 63,000 state salary, combined with interest payments due on the award, would n't leave him enough to live on while he appeals the case. A lawsuit filed in 1982 by <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomson </PERSON> <PERSON> Stingley </PERSON> was settled out of court, but she later filed another lawsuit for breach of contract, alleging that <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> had broken an agreement not to reveal terms of the settlement. A federal court jury ruled in her favor last November and awarded her $ 200,000. Garnishment of <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>'s paycheck to begin paying off the judgment was to begin this month. `` Since action has been taken to garnish my wages, declaring bankruptcy is my only alternative,'' said <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, 56. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, one of Ms. <PERSON> Stingley </PERSON>'s attorneys, said he was angry at <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>'s action. `` I think he ought to resign,'' <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> said. `` He used taxpayer dollars to defend his lawsuit, and if he had the guts, he would walk out and resign.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stingley </PERSON> was fired in 1982 after working three years in the attorney general's office as a file clerk. In her 1982 lawsuit, Ms. <PERSON> Stingley </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> of making sexual advances on the job. In a sworn deposition, she also accused him of propositioning her daughter and friends of her daughter. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> and one of his supporters held a news conference in October 1985 and disclosed that Ms. <PERSON> Stinley </PERSON> was paid $ 24,000 to settle that lawsuit. At the time, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, a Republican, was preparing for a bid for governor in 1986. But in November 1985 he dropped those plans, saying the criticism and publicity surrounding the harassment case were unbearable. He also said he regretted having settled the `` unfounded and ridiculous'' lawsuit. By filing the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition Friday, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> stops the garnishment, starting with his next paycheck. In the petition, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> listed his debts as unknown, and gave his assets at $ 70,401, all of which he said are protected from creditors under Chapter 7. Despite his financial troubles, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said, `` I am proud of my record as attorney general and will continue to carry out my duties to the very best of my ability.'' <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> is serving his third four-year term as attorney general. He has not indicated whether he intends to seek a fourth term next year.

<TEXT>
 The White House grounds echoed Saturday with clanking metallic sounds and shouts of `` good shoe'' and `` c'mon Mr. Smooth.'' It was the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> christening his new horseshoe pit and showing off his pitching form. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined by some 150 picnic guests, including national champion horseshoe pitchers, to inaugurate the 40-foot, clay pit he had installed next to the White House swimming pool. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a horseshoe aficionado, demonstrated his own pitching style, getting off to a rough start when he played at a secondary pit dug to handle Saturday's overflow crowd. Playing with local sportscasters <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> tackle <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threw a few marginal shoes, then turned to reporters and joked, `` When you have guests, one of the rules is to make them feel comfortable and at home, so I'm trying not to get too close to the stake.'' `` It stinks,'' was his comment on one of his pitches that went afar. Later, throwing against Gov. Guy Hunt of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got his ringer. `` Thank you very much,'' he said throwing up his hands and leaving the pit to others. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed a familiarity with horseshoe lingo, shouting such expressions as `` good shoe'' and `` c'mon Mr. Smooth,'' and `` power outage'' when someone missed a shot. Other governors who tried their hand at the pit were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. The weather was chilly and a brisk wind blew the red-and-white checked table cloths on the picnic tables set up for hot dogs and hamburgers. The table centerpieces were of daisies and horseshoes. Tuxedoed waiters served the food and wine. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> band played country music. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> wore matching warm-up jackets. Several horseshoe champions were on hand along with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> contingent that included Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, various Cabinet members and media representatives and friends of the Bushes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a demonstration by world champion <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Knisley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and the women's champion <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. They threw a neat series of ringers and near-ringers to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparent delight. <PERSON> Knisley </PERSON>, who won his second world championship in August in <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, met <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair last summer when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning for president. Before the picnic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and some of the early guests warmed up at the pit as the skies clouded over and a chilly breeze picked up. Tourists passing by the sidewalk outside the grounds could hear the sound of clanking horseshoes, but could not see the pit. Several looked up curiously toward the White House lawn.

 Tucked away in a warehouse behind the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION>, marine biologists keep deep, damp secrets. A large, cylindrical tank holds four purple-striped jellyfish _ the first ever bred in captivity. Nearby, two ocean sunfish bob in a swimming pool-sized tank, part of an effort to keep the warm-water beasts alive after currents swept them into the chill waters of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Behind the scenes, researchers prepare projects for months and years before the public gets a look. Yet less than five years after it opened on Oct. 20, 1984, the $ 50 million <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION> is far from a secret place. It ranks with <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> as one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s most popular attractions, according to tourism figures. The aquarium drew 1.7 million visitors last year. The nonprofit aquarium, located about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and built with a gift from <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON> of computer giant <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> fame, enjoys a reputation as one of the finest in the world. `` I think I've always known about the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION>,'' said visitor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on a recent weekday. `` It's like the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' Sea otters remain the most popular attraction, but visitors rave about the three-story-high, 335,000-gallon `` Kelp Forest'' centerpiece display. A dimly lit corridor snaking along the main 90-foot-long <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> Habitat display gives visitors the impression they are viewing the sea from the ocean floor. Fresh sea water is pumped into the tanks to nourish animals and plants. Because rocks are too heavy for most of the displays, artificial boulders made of fiberglass were placed on the ocean floor two years before opening day to create a weathered look and attract specimens. Then there are `` touch pools,'' in which children and adults can stick their hands and feel sea life. `` It was really neat because they're really smooth,'' 10-year-old <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said after stroking a bat ray as it swam by. `` They are kinda slimy but really smooth. Silky smooth.'' For the first time, the aquarium has mounted a temporary exhibit devoted to marine life from beyond the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Secret Sea'' displays spectacular tropical fish and other creatures native to the Sea of <LOCATION> Cortez </LOCATION>, located between <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the Mexican mainland. By choosing the Sea of <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>, administrators took advantage of novelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s historical link to <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> and good friend <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON>, a noted marine biologist and <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> resident, ventured to the gulf area in 1940 for a six-week expedition during which they collected thousands of specimens and cataloged 60 species new to science. A team of aquarium researchers made a similar expedition to collect the animals for the 6,000-square-foot exhibit, which closes Sept. 4. In one tank, toothy moray eels peek from behind rocks, evoking squeals of delight and disgust from passing schoolchildren. `` I do n't like them,'' declared 8-year-old <PERSON> Lora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kihorany </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Soquel </LOCATION>. `` They can bite you. He is long. I mean, long!'' But the aquarium has caused some ill feelings in the community. The crush of visitors has caused traffic problems and has changed the historically funky Cannery Row into more of a place for tourists. A few nearby merchants complain about unwanted competition from the aquarium's gift shop and restaurant. But a new 1,000-space municipal parking lot has helped alleviate crowding, and most merchants say the aquarium has ushered in a welcome business boom. `` Nobody likes to see the Row change,'' said <PERSON> Kristan </PERSON> <PERSON> Soboleski </PERSON>, general manager of Sly McFly's Bar and <LOCATION> Grille </LOCATION>, which has had a 25 percent increase in business since the aquarium opened. Yet she cringes at the memory of past slow winters. Aquarium officials are mum regarding future expansion, although <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> confirmed some plans are under consideration. Officials would rather talk about the aquarium's pioneering research like the breeding in captivity of the purple-striped jellyfish. `` Nobody has ever seen the young of this species before,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, director of animal husbandry. `` Only adults.'' The team of about 20 aquarists, all of whom are scuba divers who help gather animals for display, are clearly proud of their work. `` The aquarium is sort of like an onion,'' said aquarist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Upton </PERSON>. `` The more you look, the deeper you can go. People spend two hours here, but they could spend their lives.''

 Foreign creditors must cut Latin nations' high monthly payments on the region's $ 400 billion foreign debt before developing countries can stop environmental destruction, Latin officials said Saturday. A two-day <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> environmental meeting, attended by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and ecologists from 32 countries, ended Saturday with the signing of a collective statement. `` The debt can not be paid under the present conditions without increasing the hunger and misery of our people or ... the degradation of our environment,'' the document said. According to the declaration, the region must `` reverse the negative transfer of resources that has turned developing countries into capital exporters to industrialized countries.'' Latin nations last year paid $ 29 billion in interest to foreign creditors, the ministers said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the developing world's largest creditor, pays $ 1 billion monthly in interest on its $ 115 billion foreign debt The ministers called for new aid from international agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to help fund environmental protection projects. Industrialized nations have an obligation to use financial and technological resources to reverse deterioration of the world's environment, the declaration said `` The serious environmental problem the world faces today derives mainly from the industrialization, consumption and wasteful models adopted by developed nations,'' the statement said. Latin nations have come under fire recently for not adopting appropriate environmental controls to protect wilderness areas. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where researchers estimate an area the size of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> has already been slashed and burned from the vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, the government has said it wo n't implement ecological programs at the expense of development.

<TEXT>
 Endangered sea turtles and humpback whales have been sighted off <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> beaches soiled by at least 10,000 gallons of oil from a mystery spill, and officials were concerned about the long-term effects of oil on the animals. Crews Saturday continued to clean bunker fuel oil from more than 20 miles of beach on the islands of <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION>, two of the most undeveloped in the main Hawaiian chain. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw whales surfacing through an oil slick and witnessed green sea turtles feeding just off a tarred beach. Humpback whales and green sea turtles are both listed as endangered species. Although no marine animals had been harmed by the oil yet, `` There may be some long-term effects,'' he said. <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> was particularly concerned about the sea turtles, which feed on algae that may have been tainted by toxic substances in the oil. Oil was first spotted between <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION> last Sunday. Authorities said at the time the spill appeared minor and most of the oil would likely drift out to sea. However, the oil sullied a nine-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION>'s south coast and about 10 miles of <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION>'s shore in the form of tar balls and small puddles. Beachgoers have been warned, said State Health Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>. The source of the spill has yet to be determined. Officials Friday upgraded the spill from `` minor'' to `` medium,'' although the precise amount of oil spilled had not been determined. `` A medium spill means that at least 10,000 gallons but less than 100,000 gallons has spilled. We ca n't be certain because we do n't know the size of the tank that it came from, and that's the best way to tell,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>. `` It's definitely on the low side of the scale.'' Bunker fuel oil is less toxic than crude oil, which comes straight from the ground and has more petroleum and other gases, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. The incident was <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s second oil spill in less than a month. On March 2, the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> broke loose from a mooring and ran aground off <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, spilling more than 30,000 gallons of oil and polluting two miles of shoreline.

 A <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> family is giving state lawmakers until the end of April to decide whether to buy picturesque <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, an uninhabited coral atoll 960 miles south of here. The asking price: $ 33 million. Otherwise, the 600 acres of land within the 8,000-acre reef-protected atoll will go to the highest bidder, preferably one who is willing to preserve the island's natural beauty, said <PERSON> Ainsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullard-Leo </PERSON>, the youngest of three brothers who own the island. `` We've had it for a number of years now and we're not in a position to develop it. We're getting on in years and feel it is time to sell it and move on,'' said <PERSON> Fullard-Leo </PERSON>, 57. `` We're giving the state the first chance at it.'' `` I view the purchase with a manifest destiny mentality,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who introduced the bill to buy the island. `` It is something that could be tremendously important for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s future generations. People laughed at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> and `` Seward's Folly,'' the 1867 purchase of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> for $ 7 million, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> said he is willing to give the purchase `` real consideration,'' if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> decides to buy it. The bill has been approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and is pending before the House. What makes <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION> especially attractive is its deep draft harbor, an airstrip left over from World War II and frequent rainfall, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Savio </PERSON>, a realtor representing the family. In recent years, the island 200 miles north of the <LOCATION> equator </LOCATION> has served primarily as a stopping-off place for yachtsmen, he said. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> scientists view it as ideal for a variety of oceanographic and marine life research and a possible site for equatorial space launches. State administration officials say it could be a vaulable commercial and recreational fishing center. Most of the attention from private interests, however, appears to focus on building an exclusive resort on the flat U-shaped string of islets that ring two deep lagoons with white sand beaches. The family has in recent months had 10 offers in the range of $ 30 million from a variety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese companies and one <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation, but most have asked that they not be identified, <PERSON> Savio </PERSON> said. `` We would like to see someone who is ecologically minded take over and preserve the wildlife and the birds there,'' he said. The island, acquired by the Fullard-Leos' parents in 1922 from a business partner after a fishing enterprise fell on hard times, has been a financial albatross for the family. The family had to sell property in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to pay for legal expenses during a seven-year court fight with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which contested the family's title to <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fullard-Leo </PERSON> said. The family finally won clear title in a 1947 ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Tax Reform Inaugurated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sweeping overhaul of the tax system took effect Saturday, befuddling consumers and shopkeepers and increasing opposition leaders' calls for the resignation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s already beleaguered prime minister. The centerpiece of the reform is a new 3 percent `` consumption tax'' on everything from taxi rides to apartment rents. At the same time, the reform cuts corporate, inheritance, higher-level income and residential taxes by $ 44.6 billion in fiscal 1989. Part of those cuts will be offset by the sales tax, which the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has said will bring in $ 24.8 billion its first year. It was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first major tax overhaul since World War II, and shoppers found themselves confronting long lines as shopkeepers tried to adjust to the new system. `` Customers must wait longer at the register since we're not used to calculating this tax yet,'' said <PERSON> Tokiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekitake </PERSON>, a clerk at a drugstore in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But they are n't complaining. Most blame the government and sympathize with us.'' Dozens of city councils across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> criticized the tax, and some have reportedly pledged not to implement it in certain sectors. Because of adjustments in a variety of taxes, the reform affected goods unevenly. Some prices rose, while others fell and others remained unchanged. It lowered taxes on expensive imported liquor but increased the price of milk. Vending machine soft drink prices stayed the same. Television sets were cheaper, but newspapers raised their prices. The cost of a Big Mac hamburger at <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> went from $ 2.84 to $ 2.93 but because of altered service charges, meals at posh restaurants became more affordable. Prices of foreign luxury cars and domestic autos dropped, while taxi and subway fares increased. Taxes on automobiles will be cut from the present 15 percent to just 3 percent in three years. The government granted a special exemption to small businesses, meaning two-thirds of Japanese enterprises wo n't have to hand over the tax to the federal government. Small business and the agricultural sector are the mainstay of support for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But many small enterprises, such as independent taxis and discount stores, raised their prices anyway to offset increased operating costs. The government says the sales tax will fit the needs of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current economy better than an income tax It claims the main goal of the reform plan is to distribute the tax burden more equitably by lightening the burden on middle-income workers. But several groups, including the 1 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housewives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, claim ambiguities in the reforms will lead to unfair price increases and even formation of price-fixing cartels. Soon after taking office in October 1987, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> made tax reform a major goal. Last December his party, which commands comfortable majorities in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, voted the package into law despite the first no-confidence motion by opposition parties in five years. But the tax reform and a stock-trading scandal involving <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and many of his party's elite have led to support ratings as low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls. Opposition party leaders repeated their calls for abolition of the tax and for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign. `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has said there will come a day when -LRB- people -RRB- will be glad the sales tax was implemented,'' <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said in a speech today. `` That is the lie of the century.''

<TEXT>
 In a rare admission for a society that long claimed to have eliminated poverty, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> researcher said Saturday that most Soviet citizens lack the cash for a `` rational consumer budget.'' The researcher, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuravlyov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, did n't quite admit poverty exists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But he came very close in his article in Vechernyaa Moskva -LRB- Evening <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` For a long time, no one talked about poverty,'' <PERSON> Zhuravlyov </PERSON> wrote. Despite claims that poverty does not exist in socialist countries, at least 40 million Soviets can be described as `` poorly supplied,'' he said. Going further, <PERSON> Zhuravlyov </PERSON> said that `` If it is assumed that a rational consumer budget is 250-300 rubles -LRB- $ 400-480 -RRB- per person, if the low purchasing ability of the ruble and growth of prices is taken into account, then more than half of the country's population, with per capita incomes of less than 125 rubles -LRB- $ 200 -RRB- per month, can not be called rich. The average industrial salary in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is $ 347 a month. Most families live in tight quarters with rents of $ 40 to $ 65 a month, but a pair of boots costs about a month's pay. <PERSON> Zhuravlyov </PERSON> also pointed to new research showing families with the lowest cash incomes also have some of the smallest living spaces, typically allocated by government authorities. The poorest families, with per capita incomes under $ 112 per month, have just 27 to 45 square feet of living space per person, he wrote. Many of the poorest are simply low-income families with three and four children, <PERSON> Zhuravlyov </PERSON> wrote. Such large families are a rarity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, though not in the Central Asian republics of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Four women who began a hunger strike March 20 to demand the return of a provincial church to religious use were hauled off the church steps Saturday by police and ambulance personnel, a human rights activist said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, editor of the Bulletin and <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said the four women have refused even water in their fast in <LOCATION> Ivanovo </LOCATION>, 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Before dawn Saturday, six carloads of police and ambulance personnel took the women to a local hospital after taking them away from the church, where they have been since last month. Their relatives have been denied access to them, <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said. The women want the church, built in 1914 and known as the Vedenskaya or <ORGANIZATION> Krasni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, returned to religious use. Since 1938, it has housed the city archives, which are soon to be moved to a new building. Most churches in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are closed or used for non-religious purposes. However, a few, most notably the cathedral in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, have been returned to use as churches in the past year as President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> eases restrictions on the practice of religion. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> quoted the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chief, identified only as <PERSON> Knyazuk </PERSON>, as saying the hunger strikers could continue for a year but the church would never be returned for worship. The women were identified as <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Savchenko </PERSON>, 41, a cleaning woman; <PERSON> Larissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kholina </PERSON>, 53, a dentist; her daughter, <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelenkova </PERSON>, 28; and <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeshukovskaya </PERSON>, 43, a lawyer. The hunger strike began March 20 at an <LOCATION> Ivanovo </LOCATION> movie theater with eight people, but two men and two women dropped out. The strikers were forcibly removed, tossed in trucks and taken to the steps of the church, where a wooden fence was erected and a policeman stationed to prevent them from talking to the the public, the activist said. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON>, with a population of 500,000, currently has one active church large enough for 300 people, <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Iraqis crowded polling stations nationwide Saturday to elect a new 250-member National Assembly in what was seen as the first step toward democracy after 20 years of one-party rule. Twelve hours of voting ended at 8 p.m. and election committee officials began counting votes in more than 900 polling stations around the country. Officials said the turnout was relatively high, but exact figures were not immediately available. They said the first returns would be announced Sunday with final results not expected until Monday. About 2 million of the estimated 8 million voters live in the capital, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, which had 59 polling stations. The government-controlled media called the election, the first since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` a celebration of democracy'' and called on Iraqis to cast ballots `` as a national duty.'' Columnist <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Farhan </PERSON> wrote in the <LOCATION> Al-Qaddissiya </LOCATION> newspaper that voters should elect people who would work for `` a permanent constitution, general freedoms, a multiparty system, reasonable prices, housing for all, improved social services, comprehensive health insurance, defense of human rights and battling embezzlers and thieves.'' The assembly is expected to endorse a new constitution and a new law establishing a multiparty system after 20 years of rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Polling day was declared a national holiday to ensure a big voter turnout, and stores and offices were closed. Nearly 700 independent candidates, more than in two previous assembly elections, ran for the part-time legislature. In addition, there were 260 candidates from the ruling party, although authorities have stressed they are not members of an official ticket. Forty-two candidates were dropped at the last minute when it was discovered in snap tests they could not read or write, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday night. The assembly, elected to a four-year term, shares legislative power with the Council, which must ratify draft laws and also has veto power. Diplomats and political analysts say the election outcome may influence future policy-making by enabling independents to play a bigger role in decision making. But no timetable has been set for the political reforms, and they are not expected to reduce President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s personal power. A referendum will be held on the new constitution, which will replace an interim charter approved in 1969, one year after the Baath party seized power in a bloodless coup. The elections originally were set for last Aug. 30 but were postponed until March 3 after the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war took effect The second delay was to allow more independents to run, the government said. The candidates, including 62 women and many gulf war veterans, staged low-key campaigns, confined under government rules to making brief speeches to organized gatherings and answering a few questions. Their campaigns were funded by the government and candidates were banned from using any of their own financial resources.

<HEAD>Government Devalues Currency By 230 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices tripled Saturday for rice, fuel, cooking gas and airline tickets after <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> devalued its currency by 230 percent and doubled interest rates to 35 percent. The government increased wages only 20 percent in the move, which was made to meet International Monetary Fund conditions for aid. Finance Minister <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenidge </PERSON> announced the move during a budget hearing late Friday to cries of `` shame, shame and hardship'' from opposition lawmakers. `` This is a budget of violence,'' said <PERSON> Cheddi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagan </PERSON>, leader of the Marxist opposition <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Mirror, an opposition newspaper, called the devaluation `` murderous.'' Average daily wages in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation are $ 2.30, while a loaf of bread costs $ 5. The <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> dollar, previously fixed at 10 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, is now worth 33.3 to the dollar. However, by Saturday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was fetching 62 <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> dollars on the black market. Though the tough austerity measures were taken to satisfy <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> conditions for a $ 1.9 billion aid package, <PERSON> Greenidge </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has refused to conclude the deal until <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> raises an additional $ 50 million to clear back payments to the fund. <PERSON> Greenidge </PERSON> said the government expects to raise the money in two weeks. <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, which has had no economic growth in 10 years, is attempting to secure the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> package to revamp its stagnant economy. This former British colony's main foreign-exchange earning exports _ bauxite, sugar and rice _ recorded drops in production of up to 30 percent in 1988. For several months the nation of 750,000 has been plagued by power rationing and outages, food and fuel shortages and spiraling inflation, causing sporadic strikes and food riots. Since the death of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, President <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> has moved toward a free-market system, divesting state enterprises and encouraging foreign capital investments.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> Sunday for talks that focus attention on the contrast between President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s doctrinaire Marxism and the pragamatic reforms of his communist sponsor. It will be the Soviet leader's first visit to a Latin American country and only his third meeting with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the 27th <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power and participated in the November 1987 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. In addition to the formal talks beginning Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will participate in ceremonial wreath layings and visit a health clinic, a genetic engineering center, and a crew of people who build housing on a voluntary basis. He is expected to address the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in a nationally broadcast speech Tuesday and leaves the next day for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and meetings with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>. Both nations have stressed in recent public statements the friendly nature of the visit and the healthy relations between the two communist countries. But <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in the past has been openly critical of `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious modernization program, for borrowing free-market concepts from capitalism. There are indications the Soviets have substantially reduced their aid to the island nation 90 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. The Soviets highlighted another difference in the two systems when they held a news conference in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Friday to trumpet the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s March 26 parliamentary elections. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, most forms of dissent are still banned as counterrevolutionary and can carry long prison terms. At a time when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is searching for new ideas and proposing experiments to spur economic development, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has warned that financial incentives for individuals and decentralizing the economy are dangerous. `` We must watch over the ideological purity of the revolution,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told his nation on the 30th anniversary of his victory on July 26. `` That is why we can not use any methods that reek of capitalism.'' Soviet officials and Western observers agree <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is unlikely to lecture the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader in public or respond directly to his charges that Soviet reforms take too much from capitalism. That would be seen as a direct contradiction of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s often-stated view that there is no one correct route to socialist development Diplomats in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it is unlikely <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is willing to continue subsidizing the Cuban economy at present levels while faced with widespread shortages, deficit spending and increasingly difficult economic problems at home. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> provides <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion annually in economic and military assistance, and the aid programs and subsidies account for as much as 20 percent of the Cuban gross national product. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonynmity, said the Soviets already appear to have reduced their purchases of Cuban sugar, which they buy at higher-than-market prices as a way of providing Cuban foreign aid. Some diplomats said they expect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to tell <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> bluntly _ but in private _ that <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> must put its economic house in order. But they suggest <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may make a public show of superpower support by announcing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s willingness to forgive all or part of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s ruble debt, which has accumulated in the 30 years since the Cuban Revolution. To forgive a debt that is unlikely ever to be repaid actually would cost <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> very little, one diplomat said, while raising the ante for Western industrialized countries that hold most of the Third World debt. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in December the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was prepared to offer the least-developed countries a moratorium on debt service and `` in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether'' if the West would go along with a program to solve the debt problems of poorer countries.

 Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers and a support vessel steamed out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Saturday in the biggest pullout of American warships from the region since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire 7 -LCB- months ago. The tank landing ship USS <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> sailed through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> as escort for the mine sweepers Fearless, Inflict and Illusive, bound for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ports. Their departure left 10 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the gulf, including three mine sweepers. With a nine-ship carrier battle group in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet was reduced to fewer than 20 ships for the first time since the massive Western naval buildup of mid-1987. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official said the withdrawal of the three mine sweepers was decided after `` consultations with our friends in the gulf'' and `` is consistent with the reduced threat to shipping'' since the Aug. 20 cease-fire. The truce ended eight years of hostilities that had spread to the oil-rich gulf. The fighting damaged or sank about 540 commercial ships and killed 300 sailors. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sharply expanded its force in the gulf to protect U.S.-flag shipping and to escort 11 Kuwait-owned oil tankers that were re-registered under the Stars and Stripes. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s shipping was being targeted by Iranian gunboats because of its support for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Five Western European governments also sent extra warships and at one time the foreign navies in the region had a combined strength of nearly 80 ships. The others have largely withdrawn since the cease-fire. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said that apart from the three remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers, whose future is uncertain, the latest withdrawal may be the last by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said the 8,450-ton <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> will escort the three departing `` sweeps'' back to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and return to its port in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The Fearless and Illusive are based in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and the Inflict in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The 720-ton, wooden-hulled mine sweepers were built just after the Korean war in the early 1950s and are the oldest <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships on active duty. Derided by critics as too old and outmoded, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers outstripped the more modern European mine sweepers in disposing of mines laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the gulf. The sources said the three departing vessels were credited with about half of more than 50 mines found and destroyed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-mine ships since they arrived in November, 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have said that despite the cease-fire, a threat from undiscovered mines laid by both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will persist in the gulf, especially in its northern waters. Four previous cutbacks of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force since the cease-fire had involved only one warship at a time. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has approved the `` deflagging'' of six of the 11 Kuwaiti tankers, but the process has been stalled for over a month, reportedly over legal details.

A service is planned Monday in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus to honor the comics page hero created by <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> native and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> died April 3, 1988, at age 81 and the last Steve Canyon strip appeared in Sunday newspapers June 5. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel prepared a biography and list of Canyon's exploits and will present it to the university An exhibit will be set up in the journalism school's library, recently dedicated to <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>'s memory. `` Through <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Canyon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> did a lot to keep up the spirits of fliers and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' said 1st Lt. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. `` He really became a part of Air Force lore, and people remember.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the presentation was the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s idea. Canyon is said to have attended <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> _ the predecessor of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> _ in 1947. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> went through all the old Canyon comic strips, compiling a `` personnel record'' for the character through his 1988 retirement. `` People here -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> McGuire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -RRB- and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have dedicated a lot of time, energy and imagination to the project,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` We are very happy and honored to do something that will be seen by others and is going to last.'' Canyon's service record `` includes decorations, citations, movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts of good stuff,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> decided that since his record was so varied, the character should be assigned to the Office of Special Investigations. `` That also allowed us to say certain things were ` classified' and we coud n't discuss them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will present a modern uniform with Canyon's insignia, rank and name tag, along with a retirement certificate for Canyon and his wife, <PERSON> Summer </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> A display will hold his 13 medals and eight ribbons.

 Thirteen trucks flying the blue flag of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> rolled out of the capital Saturday, one of the first shipments of a $ 132-million relief operation aimed at feeding 2.5 million people in the south. Before the rainy season begins in early May, Operation Lifeline aims to position at depots more than 100,000 tons of food, blankets, tents and medical supplies to keep alive those displaced by famine and civil war. Trucks, airplanes, trains and <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barges are being pressed into duty in the project, which for the first time includes deliveries to villages and areas under control of Christian and animist rebels fighting the Moslem-dominated government. For the first time, both the government and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> have promised not to attack or otherwise hinder the relief shipments. Previous efforts were hampered by one side or the other for political or military reasons. In <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> media spokesman for Operation Lifeline, said a convoy of five trucks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sponsorship carrying 30 tons of food left <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> on Friday. On Monday, a 60-truck convoy is scheduled to leave with 1,000 tons of food and 10 tons of medical supplies, tarpaulins and pallets. The drivers who left <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> were on a risky 450-mile journey to the western village of <LOCATION> Muglad </LOCATION>, just north of the war zone. Already 12,000 southerners were sheltered in <LOCATION> Muglad </LOCATION> in mid-March and hundreds more have been arriving daily. The drivers were to to take their vehicles over roads that hardly deserve the name and nervously close to <LOCATION> Kadugli </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> region, where heavy fighting has been reported in recent weeks. `` If we do n't do this, the disaster will be roughly equal to the disaster of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official coordinating Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. `` Or in recent history, it will be four times larger a disaster than <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last fall.'' Soviet officials estimated 25,000 people died in the massive earthquake that struck <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in December. An estimated 78,000 people died when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped the atomic bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> on Aug. 6, 1945 in its war against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and up to 140,000 died within a few months. Nobody knows how many people already have died in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 6-year-old civil war Western relief experts put the figure from 1988 alone at 250,000 to 500,000 or more. Some think as many as 2 million have died since the war began in 1983, mostly civilians driven from their homes who either perished while seeking shelter or left to starve in refugee camps or besieged towns. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, special representative of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, described the Sudanese operation as `` a race against time -LRB- and -RRB- a mission impossible that could be possible with the cooperation of everybody.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government previously refused to allow relief agencies' to deal with the rebels. Rebel gunners have shot down at least two civilian passenger planes and one relief plane and have fired on several others, claiming the government uses civilian and relief aircraft to transport troops and military supplies. The rebels also have been blamed for attacks on relief trucks, barges and trains that have killed dozens of people.

 As much as a foot of fresh snow fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, and about six inches fell in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> before an Eastern storm began to fizzle. A cold front moved across the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the central Plains, producing rain from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Wet snow fell in central and northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Light snow tapered off across portions of the central Appalachians and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after dumping a half foot of snow across the <LOCATION> Adirondacks </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

Snow and strong winds made driving difficult over mountain passes. An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the northern and central mountains of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. In the far West, a cold front produced rain over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Snow advisories were posted for the Cascades of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and northern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Another cold front moving across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> brought gusty winds to the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>.

 Mayoral front-runner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> sang with supporters Saturday, smiling and tapping his feet with his faithful in mostly white neighborhoods while top challenger <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> worked to boost black turnout in hopes of a miracle finish for Tuesday's election. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> began the day at rallies in different parts of town, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> warning <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> supporters against complacency and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> appearing with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at Operation PUSH's South Side headquarters. `` This election is not won by names, not won by endorsements and not won by polls,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said at a church. Many in the crowd wore jackets sporting the logos of neighborhood taverns, and the three-term <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor accepted his own navy blue `` Elect <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'' jacket. The flagging campaign of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> got a boost Friday from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who endorsed the third-running Republican. `` He supported me and I do n't forget those things,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s plans for Saturday included a spaghetti dinner in his home ward and a rally organized by Hispanics. Heading into Tuesday's election, poll results show <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s support near 50 percent compared with about 35 percent for third-party candidate <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the lone black in the race <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, the former county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman who switched parties and became the write-in GOP winner in February's primary, has about 5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 70 percent of the 1.56 million voters in the nation's third largest city would turn out Tuesday. Turnout is considered a crucial factor in the election to complete the last two years of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s second term. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, died in November 1987, only months into his second term. Black turnout prospects brightened somewhat for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> on Saturday when he won the endorsement of a key black minister who had been leaning toward <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, has a large South Side following. `` Give us this day our <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> bread,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said, punning on `` daily bread'' to the cheers of 1,500 people in the audience at PUSH. Meanwhile, an enthusiastic crowd of about 300 greeted <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, in the basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> _ son of the legendary political boss and six-term mayor, the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> _ entered to a standing ovation and sang along. He also delivered what has become his stump campaign speech. `` People are sick and tired of the name calling, the pettiness. ... I've been to every community in every part of this city and all people want to hear are the issues _ education, crime, how to get the gangs out of their neighborhoods.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> won the Democratic primary Feb. 28 over Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, creating the possibility that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would become by far the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city to replace a black incumbent with a white. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s voting population is 48 percent white, 42 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> lost by 100,000 votes and many blamed low black turnout on <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, his chief rival to succeed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a South Side alderman running on the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket, began the day with an appearance at Operation PUSH. Later in the afternoon, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> trekked to the far North Side and spoke to a racially mixed crowd of about 100 at the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` All the issues that the press is trying to make you ignore are there,'' he said pointing to a table of his campaign literature, posters and buttons.

 Back-to-back visits by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> during the coming week will force the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to come to grips with problems in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but there will be no rush to judgment. `` It would be nice if we could see concrete progress so far as the peace process is concerned,'' a well-placed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Friday. `` But we ought not to set markers up out there that may or may not be realized.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will focus on the Palestinian uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but in vastly different ways. The Egyptian leader, whose country signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979, is lobbying for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and a seat at the table for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> arrived by helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> about 4:30 p.m. EST at a spot between the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument and <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> and was met by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and a military honor guard. Neither of them talked with reporters before leaving by motorcade. He plans a quiet weekend before talks open on Monday with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who accuses the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of unrelenting terrorism despite public renunciation last December by Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, will propose to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> that elections be held on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The idea, said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, his media adviser, is to designate Palestinian leaders to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is not a man who can be pressured,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` So this does not come from a sense of pressure. He wants to move the peace process forward.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who barred use of his name and title, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were hoping <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would bring `` some new ideas and some new proposals.'' He begged off evaluating <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s elections proposal on the grounds it is vague. But the official pointed out that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been trying to talk to Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> without success. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, now in the midst of reviewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and other regions, as well, are reluctant to outline a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. `` If we move too fast or at too high a level it could pre-empt more promising possibilities that might present themselves,'' the official said. `` We would like to see the Israelis come with new ideas and new proposals.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in testifying last month before a congressional subcommittee, said his goal was direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. He also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might have to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in order to have a `` meaningful'' dialogue. Another <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> idea was shot down even before <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s arrival. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed that the Egyptian leader meet with him on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil to try to find ways to resolve the Palestinian problem, but <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> turned him down, <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. The proposal apparently had the approval of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. In a way, it would have recreated the meetings former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> held at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in 1978 with the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and former Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>. The agreements reached at the presidential retreat produced a peace treaty in 1979 between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and called for Palestinian autonomy on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, through the Egyptian embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, rejected the proposal, <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, meanwhile, `` we would support any meeting that would advance prospects for peace.'' But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the substance of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s overture. A diplomatic source, also insisting on anonymity, said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> had concluded <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would neither agree to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> nor approve an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Apparently, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> suspected <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was seeking <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s blessing for the elections that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader will propose to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> be held among Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> So, the source said, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> turned <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> down. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has been trying to use the leverage of its relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to promote talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said `` we want to find an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and the best way to find a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership is to hold elections. The prime minister wants to find a solution to the problem.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Monday. The president will take him to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Monday afternoon to see the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> open the baseball season. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> then will meet with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> again on Tuesday. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will hold his talks with the president and secretary of state on Wednesday and Thursday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> blames the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for instigating the violence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in which 415 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died since the uprising began in December 1987. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said Israeli intelligence had intercepted orders from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, calling for increased disorder while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mexico Begins Major Drug Interdiction Campaign Along U.S. Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reinforced Mexican anti-drug units began stopping and searching cars at roadblocks along the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border Saturday in a major operation expected to last at least several weeks, officials reported. `` An operation was established along all of the border,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, narcotics supervisor for the federal judicial police in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Judicial police, the army and federal highway police, backed by planes and helicopters, are taking part in the operation, according to <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> and other anti-narcotics officials in northern cities. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, spokesman for the Attorney General's office, said Friday the campaign was `` possibly the largest of its kind.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were sharing intelligence information in the effort. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said he had no information about a major operation. `` There are checkponts on the major highways to detect weapons and drugs,'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalon </PERSON>, a police official in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, said by telephone. He said among the personnel added for the campaign were 1,000 federal police and more agents of the federal Attorney General's office `` When there is someone who seems suspicious they are making detailed checks,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalon </PERSON> said. He said the operation would last indefinitely, depending on the results. `` We think it's going to be a considerable length of time,'' he said. The operation extends along a broad swath of the northern border and at least as far south as near the city of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, a police commander said. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said the program was patterned after Operation Alliance, a U.S.-Mexican project started in August 1986 that involved hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents and millions of dollars in surveillance equipment to detect flights ferrying drugs across the border. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general at the time, called that operation `` the most widespread interdiction program on our land borders in law enforcement history.'' Narcotics smuggling has been one of the most sensitive issues between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have called for a greater effort by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to stop the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> regularly cites its anti-narcotic efforts and says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should attack the widespread demand for drugs at home. On Saturday the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said federal highway police seized more than 20,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,879 pounds of cocaine in the first three months of the year.

 Fire burning over 480 acres of brush destroyed a house, a mobile home and two trailers as firefighters battled flames pushed over rocky terrain by erratic winds Saturday, authorities said. No injuries were reported and there was no estimate on the value of the loss, said Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> and Fire Protection. The blaze, in the rugged <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> four miles west of this small eastern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> town, was 70 percent contained late Saturday afternoon and was expected to be fully controlled by 6 p.m. Sunday, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said. About 250 firefighters were battling the fire. The house was lost when the fire came out of a deep gorge packed with thick brush. `` It's real, real heavy material at the bottom,'' he said. The blaze erupted when smoldering embers from a blaze that had been controlled several days earlier were whipped up by 60 mph winds. The earlier fire had begun as a controlled burn of a trash pile, but was whipped out of control by high winds last week, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. That fire, which was ignited March 21, was controlled the following day. Steep terrain and winds of about 30 mph hampered firefighters on Saturday, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The rugged area's picturesque mountains, located 175 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, were used in the filming of many Western movies.

 Israeli troops shot and killed one Palestinian in a clash Saturday in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said 16 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations throughout the occupied territories. The army said a second Palestinian died Saturday of gunshot wounds suffered last week. It confirmed that two Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said it was checking the other reports. The deaths raised the Palestinian death toll to 417 since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis have been killed. Hospital officials identified the Palestinian killed Saturday as <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, 24, and said he was shot in the heart. They said <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>'s family took his body from the hospital and held a funeral that quickly turned into a nationalist demonstration. The military said the Palestinian was critically wounded after a group of Arabs stoned an army jeep patrol and two soldiers suffered minor injuries. The soldiers took the wounded Arab to Muqassed hospital in annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where he died. Hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags as <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>'s coffin was carried through <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON> The funeral march broke up after troops said no more than 40 people could participate in the procession and fired in the direction of the crowd. There were no reported injuries. The army imposed a curfew on the village's 4,000 residents after the funeral. Hospital officials identified the other Palestinian who died as <PERSON> Tareq </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, 23, from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. He was wounded Thursday. An army spokesman said the military was investigating reports that Jewish settlers shot the man. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 12 Palestinians were wounded, including a 13-year-old who was shot in the back and a 15-year-old who was shot in the stomach, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Four Arabs, including a 12-year-old, were wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when troops opened fire to break up a demonstration in the area's commercial center, sources at Arab hospitals said A worker for an international organization in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said that during the demonstration eight Israeli undercover agents wearing kaffiyehs, or Palestinian headdresses, joined the protesters in throwing stones at the soldiers. The worker, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his organization be identified, said that as the demonstration grew, one agent pulled out an Uzi submachine gun and began firing in the air. The agents then arrested at least four Arab youths, the worker said. In another development, the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sent a message to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> deploring the actions of Israeli police, whom it accused of masquerading as journalists. Police investigators in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last week cleared two plainclothes officers who had been accused of putting a TV sign on their rental car as they patrolled Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The inquiry came in response to complaints from journalists after news photographers filmed the two plainclothes officers driving the car and arresting a 15-year-old Palestinian girl. Following protests from reporters, Police Inspector-General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said he would limit the practice by requiring police to seek his permission before masquerading as journalists. The press institute message, signed by its president, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> and released on Friday, said the <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> `` deplores the recent tactics used by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police to impersonate members of the press as a means of arresting Palestinian demonstrators.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as an independent organization representing nearly 2,000 leading publishers and editors in 60 countries.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Saturday buried its last empress, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>, with all the pomp and pageantry of a vanished monarchy that for centuries ruled territory from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The nation's biggest funeral since Emperor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> was buried in 1916, in the waning days of the Hapsburg Empire, seemed like an act of reconciliation with the family that brought <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> greatness but was driven into exile after World War I. An elaborate Requiem Mass in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s towering St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s Cathedral climaxed a week of ceremonies honoring <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> two weeks ago at 96 When she and her husband left the country in 1918, she was denounced as a spy for her role in a plot to end the war. Police estimated the number of spectators at 40,000, including hundreds from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and other parts of what was once the <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Empire </LOCATION>. State television broadcast the ceremony live, and the nation's largest-circulation daily, <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kronen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, bore the headline, `` Farewell to <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>,'' printed against a background of imperial Hapsburg yellow <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hapsburg </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s sprawling Schoenbrunn Palace with his parents, led mourners who included President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. All <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> royal houses sent representatives. But no crowned heads attended the four-hour ceremony, which drew curious, sometimes bemused spectators in an outpouring of nostalgia for the glory of the empire. `` The Austro-Hungarian monarchy was the best state for central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paizs </PERSON>, a 21-year-old Hungarian who called himself a monarchist and came from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for the occasion. `` The small countries do n't function as well separately.'' An Austrian woman who refused to identify herself said she had always been a monarchist, adding: `` Nothing better has come after the monarchy.'' Between passages from the soaring Requiem of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s most beloved composer, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Amadeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, the Mass was laced with tributes to the huge Hapsburg Empire that stretched north to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, south to northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and east to what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Intercessions were read in each language of the polyglot empire _ German, Italian, Hungarian, Croat, Slovene, Czech and Polish. At the end of the two-hour Mass, the old imperial hymn that was replaced with a <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> anthem in 1918 rang through the vaulted naves of the Gothic cathedral. Cardinal <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON>, in a brief address, said the singing of the hymn `` is not nostalgia, or flirting with a different state or political system.'' He recalled that <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>, who always refused to abdicate formally, had before her death expressed confidence that the peoples of the former empire would live well. <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>, who was also queen of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, will be honored at a separate Mass in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasksai </PERSON> attended Saturday's ceremony. An isolated crowd of protesters held aloft a banner that said, `` The Empress is Dead _ Long Live the Republic.'' Police detained at least two people when they tried to unfurl another banner outside the imperial vault where <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> was buried. At the vault's doors, an ancient ceremony was re-enacted in which a monk asked, `` Who wants to enter?'' and allowed the coffin in only when <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> was identified not by her string of imperial, royal and aristocratic titles, but as `` a mortal and a sinner.'' Following an ancient family custom, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s heart was buried in the Swiss village of <PERSON> Muri </PERSON> with that of her husband. <PERSON> Muri </PERSON> is a traditional resting place for the hearts of some <ORGANIZATION> Hapsburgs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s hearse was the same as that used for <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s last journey to the Capuchin Vault where all the Hapsburg emperors except <PERSON> Zita </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, are buried. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s nephew, was buried on the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Madeira </LOCATION>, where he died in exile at age 34, 67 years to the day before the elaborate funeral accorded his widow. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> became emperor of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and king of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after the death of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who reigned 68 years. When <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> were crowned, they believed only a rapid truce could save the crumbling dual monarchy, then allied with the <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> of the German <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> had a key role in arranging secret contacts with the Allies in search of a peace treaty. After <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' death, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> and the couple's eight children lived on the sufferance of other European royal families. The outbreak of World War II found them in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, but they managed to flee the advancing Nazi troops and eventually landed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After the war, <PERSON> Zita </PERSON> eventually settled in a modest two-room apartment in a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> convent close to the Austrian border. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> allowed her to return in 1982.

 A judge faced growing criticism Saturday for deciding that cultural considerations warranted a light sentence for a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> immigrant who beat his wife to death because she was unfaithful. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> announced that it would complain to the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> in the next two weeks to protest the sentence of five years probation. `` I think the judge has shown both prejudice and bias by giving the husband probation,'' said <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsohn </PERSON>, the chapter president. `` It is not acceptable for a man to kill his wife for any reason.'' Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> cited `` cultural aspects'' Thursday in sentencing <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, 51, to probation in the slaying of his wife, <PERSON> Jian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, 40. The judge noted `` the effect of his wife's behavior on someone who is essentially born in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, raised in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and took all his <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> customs with him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Attempts to reach <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> by telephone Saturday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, a garment factory worker, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter for fatally striking his 99-pound wife in the head eight times with a hammer on Sept. 7, 1987. <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON>, in a five-day non-jury trial in December, acquitted him of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Orden </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was unable to form the intent necessary for second-degree murder or first-degree manslaughter, partly because of `` the overwhelming shame and humiliation'' his wife's adultery caused him. <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> denounced the ruling, saying, `` There should be one standard of justice, not one that depends on the cultural background of a defendant.'' <PERSON> Orden </PERSON> said he did n't argue at trial that it was acceptable in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` to act violently towards an act of indiscretion or infidelity,'' but referred to his client's cultural background to show his state of mind at the time of the slaying. Trial testimony showed that <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> emigrated from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986. He left his wife, 16-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> when he moved to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to find work as a dishwasher. Shortly after he returned to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, he confronted his wife in their bedroom about her infidelity and beat her when she said they could n't resume sexual relations, according to <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province on Saturday expelled an official opposed to increased Serbian control and three members of the provincial Politburo resigned. The party also rejected the resignation of <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who had submitted his resignation under pressure by striking ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners. In the purge of its ranks following violent demonstrations by ethnic Albanians Monday and Tuesday that left 24 people dead, the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> leadership expelled former party chief <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, who is under arrest, and two other members of the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It announced at the end of a 10-hour meeting that three members of the 13-member Politburo resigned. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, 41, is an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> who headed the provincial party from 1986 to 1988 and became deeply involved in the conflict between Serbs, who comprise a minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, and the Albanians. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.9 million people are ethnic Albanians. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> was arrested last month and accused of counterrevolutionary activity, a charge that carries a possible death penalty. He was a chief opponent of <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province that had a high degree of automoy. Constitutional changes that took effect Tuesday gave <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s judiciary, schools and police Serbian leaders said the changes were needed to protect the Serb minority from harassment by the Albanians. Thousands of ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> took to the streets to protest and officials reported 24 people, including two policemen, were killed and more than 200 were injured in fighting early last week. Saturday was the anniversary of riots by ethnic Albanians in 1981 that left at least nine people dead. Authorities feared renewed violence Saturday but reported it was quiet as police forces patrolled the province. Saturday's party meeting was held amid tight security in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. The leaders rejected the resignation by <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> who agreed to step down after an eight-day sit-in by 1,300 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners in the Stari Trg lead and zinc mine in February. The miners refused to leave the pit until <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>, and two other party officials resigned. The miners said <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> gave in to <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> demands to change the constitution.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday devalued <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s currency by 16.6 percent in an effort to boost exports and reduce deficit spending Officials have blamed inflation _ which reached a record 1,722 percent last year _ for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s fiscal and trade deficits. The Economy Ministry said Saturday that March consumer prices rose 42 percent over prices in February. Officials have said inflation will continue to grow in the short term because of price increases but will eventually decline as the economy stabilizes. Earlier in the week, the government increased by an average of 20 percent the prices of gasoline and subsidized foods such as wheat, cooking oil and rice. The devaluation, announced in the official <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, pushed the official exchange rate to 1,440 inti to the dollar, up from 1,200 to the dollar. The government uses the exchange rate to pay exporters and to finance imports of vital drugs and food staples. The floating free market rate, which registered 1,550 intis to the dollar Saturday, is used for nearly all other transactions. By devaluing the inti the government hopes to spur exports and reduce a growing trade deficit. The devaluation also is aimed at cutting the deficit by reducing the amount the government pays to subsidize imports.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> on Saturday appealed to Sinhalese militants and Tamil rebels to negotiate an end to more than six years of ethnic violence, and said Indian troops would be sent home. `` I personally guarantee your safety,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said at a public meeting in the village of <LOCATION> Girandurukotte </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` Let us forget the past and start a new era. I do n't deny the wrong done to you in the past.'' His speech was broadcast over state-run radio. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> promised to scrap the controversial <LOCATION> India-Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> peace accord under which 40,000 Indian soldiers have been sent to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation to put down the rebellion by Tamil militants. He said Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> had agreed to remove the troops, and that the accord would be replaced by a peace treaty between the two countries. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also offered radicals seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. He promised to do away with strict anti-terrorism laws and outlaw vigilante groups that have been blamed for the killings of Sinhalese suspected of being militants. He said his proposals were backed by all major opposition parties in the country. `` Leaders of all opposition political parties will appoint their representatives to monitor the security of everybody ... who wants to give up violence,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said. There were no immediate comment from either the Tamil rebel groups or the Sinhalese militants. An official of the opposition <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the proposals `` seemed impressive, sincere and may work.

 A rogue computer program designed at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that crippled a nationwide computer network last fall was neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal, a university commission has concluded. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> alone created the program that infected thousands of military and university computers on Nov. 2, 1988, says the panel's 45-page report obtained Saturday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 23, who is on a leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s doctoral program in computer science, declined to be interviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> created the `` worm.'' `` It may simply have been the unfocused intellectual meanderings of a hacker completely absorbed with his creation and unharnessed by considerations of explicit purpose or potential effect,'' the panel wrote. Technically, the program was not a `` virus,'' which inserts itself into a host program to propagate; it was actually a `` worm,'' or an independent program that endlessly duplicates itself once placed in a computer system. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> officials and members of the special panel were scheduled to discuss their findings at a news conference at 10 a.m. Monday. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, remains under investigation by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The panel rejected the idea that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> created the worm to point out the need for greater computer security. `` This was an accidental byproduct of the event and the resulting display of media interest,'' the commission wrote. `` Society does not condone burglary on the grounds that it heightens concern about safety and security.'' The program could have been created by many students, graduate or undergraduate, particularly if they were aware of the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> system's well-known security flaws. `` It is no act of genius or heroism to exploit such weaknesses,'' the commission said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a first-year student, should have reported the flaws he discovered, which would `` have been the most responsible course of action, and one that was supported by his colleagues,'' the panel wrote. The commission found that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> probably wanted to spread the worm without detection, but did not want to clog the computers. It said he clearly should have known the worm would replicate uncontrollably and accused <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of `` reckless disregard'' for the consequences. Once the worm was unleashed, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> made only `` minimal efforts'' to stop its spread and did not inform any person in a position of responsibility about the existence of the program, the commission reported. The panel disputed industry claims that the worm caused about $ 96 million in damage, `` especially considering no work or data were irretrievably lost.'' The episode's greatest impact may be a loss of trust among scholars who use the network, which links research centers and universities that exchange non-classified information. The report said computer science professionals seem to favor `` strong disciplinary measures,'' but the commissison said they `` should not be so stern as to damage permanently the perpetrator's career. The panel also recommended <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> develop a universitywide policy on computer abuse.

Under terms of his bail, he was allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two Cubans End Nine Years Of Asylum in Peruvian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Cubans who gained asylum in the Peruvian Embassy nine years ago have returned home after receiving government assurances they will be allowed to leave the country, diplomatic sources said Saturday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Felino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Dia </PERSON>, 39, left the embassy Friday after accepting a promise by the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government that they will be permitted to emigrate within six months. Their departure brought to an end a series of events that began in the spring of 1980 and culminated in the Mariel boat lift, when 125,000 Cubans fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between April and September. The two were among some 10,000 Cubans who entered the <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in early April 1980 hoping to leave their island homeland and its communist government. The people packed into the embassy after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> removed its security guards from outside the complex because of a dispute with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Virtually all of the Cubans in the Peruvian Embassy were allowed to leave the country. President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government opened the port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> to Cubans wishing to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the massive exodus began. But <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> refused to leave the embassy, fearing they would be arrested. A companion, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, 30, left the embassy last October and departed for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> two weeks ago, and that apparently gave the two holdouts confidence they could leave the grounds safely and then emigrate, a Peruvian consular official said. In an effort to break the deadlock over <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, the Cuban and Peruvian governments signed an agreement last May under which <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> promised to allow them to emigrate within six months of their departure from the embassy. But the two questioned <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s assurances and they staged a hunger strike during a visit in September by officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The Peruvian Embassy provided the two Cubans with food and clothing during their stay. The two spent much of their time in the embassy working on a vegetable garden.

 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on Saturday launched his election campaign by defending his government's handling of a multimillion-dollar banking scandal Speaking before tens of thousands of his supporters in this central port city, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said he was confident his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> would be re-elected to another four-year term in the June 18 elections. `` The government and I personally set into motion all the procedures provided by the constitution to clear up the scandal,'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said. His socialist government has been accused of involvement in the financial scandal surrounding fugitive Greek banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, jailed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pending an extradition hearing. It was <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s first appearance at a mass public rally since his return from open-heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in October. He was first elected to office in 1981, and again in 1985. The main conservative opposition <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party said in a statement that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> `` tried with his April Fool's Day speech to present a restored picture'' of himself and his party. `` Nothing he said deserves special comment,'' the statement said. The banking scandal and the 70-year-old premier's open affair with a 34-year-old former airline stewardess have hurt his standing considerably among voters, according to recent public opinion polls. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has dismissed the scandal as a `` foreign and domestic plot'' to overthrow his government. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> last November after being indicted in a $ 200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal.

 A police officer who fatally shot three suspects in six months was fired over two notches found etched into his pistol. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in each of the shootings, was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> on Friday after investigators probing the third killing found the notches on the gun. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 25, who insisted that he knew nothing about the nicks discovered on the trigger guard of his 9mm pistol, was fired because the police chief did n't believe him, police spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> stopped short of saying whether investigators believed the marks represented a death tally. He refused to describe the markings, except to say they were similar. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that he would meet with <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> on Monday to urge him to reconsider. The markings were discovered by <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police investigators probing the killing of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 21, who was fatally shot by <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> while being served a warrant Feb. 1 in <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, near downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was wanted on a forgery charge. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> also killed <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, as the man sat in his pickup truck and raised a handgun toward <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and a fellow officer on Aug. 2, 1988. Less than three weeks later, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> shot 33-year-old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> during a struggle that occurred along Interstate 30 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The same gun, a <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was used in all three shootings, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The gun was recovered by investigators after each shooting, but the marks were n't discovered until <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police probed the third shooting, he said. `` These markings and their possible inference were obviously very troublesome to us,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said at a news conference to announce the officer's dismissal. In September, a <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury declined to indict <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> in the first two shootings. In March, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury, which knew about the markings on the pistol, cleared him of any wrongdoing in the latest shooting. According to police records, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> has said that the pistol had been at a gunsmith shop on several occasions and that he had let friends shoot it. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the investigation would continue until police learned who put the marks on the gun, what they signify and how they were made.

 Three more bodies were found Saturday on an abandoned ranch about 1,000 yards south of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border, bringing to 12 the number of dead in a suspected drug ring reprisal, officials said. Also Saturday, a spokesman for the Sonoran Attorney General's office said authorities believe an American is behind the killings Spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peraza </PERSON> also said two people have been detained for questioning. The three bodies were found in a well where five other victims were found earlier in the week, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petropoulos </PERSON>, a homicide detective with the <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sheriff's office. Four other bodies were found in a nearby septic tank. <PERSON> Petropoulos </PERSON> said the three bodies found Saturday were all Mexican men believed to be in their 20s, and all showed signs of being strangled. <PERSON> Petropoulos </PERSON>, who has been assisting <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials in the investigation, said earlier he had never seen anything like a bathroom in an abandoned house on the ranch where some of the victims were believed to have been tortured. `` There's a strong smell of death in the air. It's a very terrible thing, a very gruesome scene. Blood was splattered and strewn, you can tell there was a lot of suffering here,'' <PERSON> Petropoulos </PERSON> said. This Mexican border city of about 75,000 residents has emerged over the past two years as the center of `` Cocaine Alley,'' because of the increased drug trafficking through the area. Mexican officials say they believe the slayings are drug related, but stopped short of connecting the slayings here with the mass murder of five men in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> last weekend. Two of the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> victims were from <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, one from <PERSON> Hermosillo </PERSON> and two from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Police said they are still trying to determine if the slayings in the two cities, about 130 miles apart, are linked.

Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government study recommends a new penalty structure for doctors who provide poor quality care to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the current system of limiting penalties to the amount of the cost to Medicaid sometimes results in penalties that are disproportionately low compared with the nature of the offense. For example, in one case the report said a doctor endangered a cardiac patient by releasing her from the hospital although she showed symptoms of a second heart attack. Because there was no additional cost to the Medicare program stemming from the doctor's negligence, no financial penalty could be imposed, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, recommended that the cost-based limit be replaced by a fixed upper limit on the size of monetary penalties. It did not recommend where the limit should be set. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that in July 1987, the inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> advised peer review organizations not to recommend financial penalties unless the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> provider had displayed a pattern of poor care and a significant amount of Medicare payment to the doctor was involved. The inspector general has since decided to drop that criteria, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, but as of February there had been no formal notification to halt the July 1987 criteria.

 How do you erect a 19-story building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>? Start with a 31-story structure. Discover zoning prohibits a building that big. Lose a three-year court battle. And receive an order to lop 12 stories off. Welcome to 108 E. 96th St., the multi-million-dollar high-rise set to shrink this month in the final act of a showdown between local activists and its developer, <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> defeated Goliath last week when the city ruled the 31-story edifice must lose its top dozen floors. The decision will cost the developer about $ 10 million in addition to the fought-over floors, leaving the building owners a little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those stories. `` We're going to take a while to digest this decision,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` We wo n't make any decision for a week or two.'' The city last week also dealt with a second <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building found to be too tall. The 811-foot CitySpire project on West 54th Street was erected 14 feet above what zoning ordinances allow. But officials spared the building a steel haircut. Developer <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichner </PERSON> won a compromise agreement in which he will build a $ 2.5 million dance studio in return for a variance. <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 10 million loss includes the cost of chopping off the illegal floors, the income from the lost apartments and the cost of the building's extended vacancy. The building remains uninhabited; it would have been ready to open in late 1986. The odds do n't look good for <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION>, which has unsuccessfully taken its battle to preserve the high-rise to the city, local court, state court and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The city rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> proposal to build about 40 low-income senior citizen apartments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> in return for a zoning variance leaving the building intact. <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> has until April 27 to appeal its most recent loss; the developer's last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that the too-tall ruling was arbitrary and capricious, <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said. Should Parkview decide not to appeal, the demolition will begin posthaste after that date, said city Buildings Department spokesman <PERSON> Vahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryakian </PERSON>. `` They have 30 days to appeal, and we're obliged to give'em that,'' <PERSON> Tiryakian </PERSON> said. `` We'll have to wait and see what happens.'' While the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12 floors, many residents of the well-to-do area could n't be happier about Tuesday's unanimous decision by the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're really very, very pleased. We feel that after this almost three-year battle, this was the right result,'' said <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, president of the local community group <ORGANIZATION> Civitas </ORGANIZATION>. It was Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> who first noticed the 31-story building violated a 1973 regulation putting a 19-floor cap on the area's skyline. Developer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, in getting a permit for the structure, used an incorrect zoning map. When the error was discovered in 1986, workers had already completed the building's concrete superstructure, installed elevator shafts to the 27th floor and finished wiring and plumbing for the first 24 stories. All that is due to come down now: workers would attack the top 12 floors as if taking down an old building, starting at the top floor and dismantling things one story at a time. When the work is completed, Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said, residents of the new building will be greeted by some very happy neighbors. `` As far as we're concerned, we're ready to celebrate the opening of a new 19-story building,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said after the board's decision. `` That would be wonderful.''

 Picket line skirmishers with clubs and chains damaged 10 police cars and a driver crashed a steel plant gate Saturday after more than 1,600 union steelworkers at <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> went on strike. Several security guards at the plant sustained minor injuries, but state police said they did n't know how or when the guards were hurt. Workers began walking off their jobs after the old contract expired at midnight Friday. Four to eight pickets were at each of the plant's eight gates and no one crossed the picket lines, union spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> said there was `` just shouting back and forth but no one was hurt'' in a picket line skirmish early Saturday, but police said 10 of their cars were damaged by clubs and chains and the tires on two units were slashed. Around 3 a.m., police said, a motorist drove a van into a gate, destroying it, and then rammed a nearby small guardhouse, partially knocking it off its foundation. Police would not say whether the driver was arrested. Despite the violence, state police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> characterized picketing as `` very orderly most of the day.'' He said state troopers would be available through the night to assist city police. <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> said troopers had made one arrest in connection with the strike. He said a man who was with the strikers at a plant gate was charged with failing to obey a lawful order and carrying a concealed weapon, a can of chemical Mace. <PERSON> Thermon </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, director of District 36 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unsure if supervisors were operating the plant, which makes steel plate and finished steel. Company officials said they would have no comment Saturday. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he expected an agreement to be reached `` within a day or so'' if negotiations continued as they have. Negotiatiors were meeting with federal mediators in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyton </PERSON>, vice-president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2176 </ORGANIZATION>, said negotiators had made some progress and would continue working toward an agreement with the maker of steel plate and finished steel. <PERSON> Guyton </PERSON> said negotiations reached an impasse over several issues: wages, profit sharing, health care costs and contracting work in the plant to outside contractors. Some 2,100 people work at the steel plant in <LOCATION> Gadsen </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. About 1,650 are union members. The lapsed three-year contract went into effect after The Brenlin Group of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> bought the plant under provisions of a court-ordered sale. Several attempts since September 1987 to reach a new work agreement have failed. <PERSON> Guyton </PERSON> said members of Local 2176, which represents production and maintenance workers, and <ORGANIZATION> USWA </ORGANIZATION> Local 4382, which represents clerical workers, would meet Sunday at a local community college to discuss the strike.

 A White House official said Saturday it would be `` highly inappropriate'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to hold discussions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on a framework for change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I am not enthusiastic about that approach,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, deputy assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for national security affairs, told an international conference, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, expressed reservations about trying `` to control the course of events'' in Soviet-dominated Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They spoke at the Quadrangular Forum sponsored by the Brussels-based Center for <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Their remarks were in response to recent reports that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is studying a proposal by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. According to those reports the proposal would be for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to ease its political and military grip on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in exchange for Western assuances not to take advantage of the situation to threaten Soviet security. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, asked about the proposal, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is still conducting foreign policy reviews. He added he believed that `` any discussion with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in a bilateral context would be highly inappropriate.'' It also would not be appropriate from the standpoint of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies or Eastern Europeans, he said. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the West should discuss the future of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with Soviet officials and added:. `` We will continue to respect legitimate Soviet security interests. But we can not, and should not, try to patronize developments in the East.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> urged a cautious approach in dealing with the changes under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We can not _ and should not _ close our eyes to momentous developments in the U.S.S.R. But we should not make concessions based on hope and popular enthusiasms in the West or attractive personalities in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Almost two-thirds of Israeli Jews say talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> are inevitable in the next five years, but an overwhelming majority oppose beginning peace negotiations now, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. According to a poll conducted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> March 23-28 for the Times, only 18 percent said negotiations should now be started on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent statement that he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But 62 percent said such talks are inevitable in the next five years. And 58 percent _ the highest number since the question was first asked almost six years ago _ say they would be willing to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it `` officially recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and ceases terrorist activities. Regardless of whether they approved of the idea, 44 percent said they thought a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in part or all of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was inevitable in the next 10 or 20 years. Only 37 percent said they thought it was possible for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to live in peace with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in those territories. More than half, 54 percent, however, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be willing to give up some territory in exchange for `` suitable guarantees,'' up from 41 percent two years ago. Nearly three-fourths, 72 percent, said they saw no contradiction between the army's handling of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, which emphasizes the use of force, and `` the nation's democratic values.'' The house-to-house survey of 1,096 Israeli Jews has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Ariane-2 rocket, after a 24-hour delay, lifted a communications satellite for <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> into Earth orbit Saturday night. The rocket was launched from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> center at <LOCATION> Kourou </LOCATION> on the northern coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> officials announced 20 minutes after the launch that the mission was completed successfully, with the TELE-X satellite placed in orbit. The launch had been scheduled for Friday night but was postponed by a last-minute malfunction of the ground computer system. The satellite, a program of the three Nordic governments, is to provide direct television broadcasts to home satellite dishes and business communications between ground terminals. Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is overseeing the program. The satellite, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Nordic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is to serve up to 5,000 business users. Officials said the television signals will be powerful enough to be received by an antenna just 12 inches in diameter. Programming has not yet been lined up for the broadcasts. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of production, marketing and launches of the Ariane rockets developed by the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> are among the member states while <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> is an associate member state. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> carried out seven missions last year as well as successful launches on Jan. 26 and March 6 this year. There are 33 satellites on the <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> order book for future launches.

 A blue cloud of pot smoke drifted over the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> campus Saturday from about 1,000 high school and college students at the 19th annual Hash Bash rally for the legalization of marijuana. Nobody was arrested, but 15 people got tickets for possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor carrying a $ 5 fine, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> police Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistka </PERSON>. Many of the assemblage were denim-clad and huffed and puffed on homemade smokes as speakers told the crowd that marijuana should be legalized. Behind them stretched a banner with golden arches similar to the McDonald's hamburger trademark that read: `` Marijuana. Over 10 Billion Stoned.'' `` There are a lot of people you would n't expect to see here,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, 19, a freshman from <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION> who said he does n't smoke marijuana `` I saw some in business suits and many are clean cut. It makes you realize -LRB- marijuana -RRB- is more widespread.'' This year, youngsters from suburban high schools drove to the university's campus to light up in what has become an April Fools' Day tradition, <PERSON> Kistka </PERSON> said `` Most of the people there were high schoolers from the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburbs out for a party,'' <PERSON> Kistka </PERSON> said, calling the bash a nuisance for officers. `` We'd prefer not to be there,'' he said. `` But if they're going to have it, we have to be there in case something happens.''

<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities appealed to an anonymous tipster Saturday to step forward with information about the latest of eight women's bodies to be found along local highways. The unidentified informant wrote a letter to District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> about two weeks ago saying a woman's body could be found along state Route 88. Authorities searched without finding the body, but two boys found the skeletal remains of a woman on Friday about 25 feet off Route 88 in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, just south of where investigators had been looking. Officials have been trying since last fall to solve the mystery surrounding womens' bodies that have been found since July along three local highways. The seventh body was discovered Tuesday off Route 140 in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>. Investigators say they have established a link between the seven identified victims and prostitution or drugs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said the most recent victim, like the others, was apparently a young woman. She remained unidentified after an autopsy Saturday. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Pina </LOCATION>, said the remains would be given to a forensic specialist who would examine dental records and perform further tests early next week. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said the tipster's letter said the author would consider coming forward if the body was found. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said authorities were strongly urging the informant to do so.

In another reported <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> deal-in-the-making, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheinberg </PERSON> declined to comment Saturday on a report that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was negotiating to acquire his entertainment conglomerate, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not talking about anything to do with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Sheinberg </PERSON> said Saturday night at the American Cinamatheque's annual benefit, The Moving Picture Ball. `` We're not commenting.'' <ORGANIZATION> KNX-AM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, reported that executives of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> met Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Otani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to wrap up a deal in which the Japanese electronics firm would acquire <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>. The station, without revealing its source, reported that no dollar amount was disclosed, but that <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> is worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion. The station said the deal would be formally announced Monday. Under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> deal announced Friday, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to purchase all outstanding stock of <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer_United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, best known in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as one of the makers of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Lonesome Dove,'' also would get the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> moviemaking group and its film library. But <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s major stockholder, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, would retain control of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> name and TV and movie studios, as well as 34 <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> movies, including `` Moonstruck'' and `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' The MGM-UA deal, if approved, would mark the first time a major <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studio passed into predominantly foreign ownership. Australian <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen before buying a controlling interest in 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> in 1985. But <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> would not be the only entertainment company to be bought by a foreign company. <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> was acquired for $ 310 million in July by British broadcaster <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> went to Australian businessman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saffron </PERSON> in December. Italian producers <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> also have been picking up some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, including the small studios <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. The UA-MGM deal, and the foreign invasion in general, have sparked the concern of at least one American network official, who questioned the fairness of federal regulations that forbid the networks from making the same kind of deals open to overseas firms. Rules drafted in the early 1970s, when the networks were the only television game in town and cable and pay-for-view were still about a decade away, prohibit the networks from going into the production business. `` Our view is that it is increasingly ironic and shortsighted to have policies on the books which allow foreign interests to dominate entertainment production while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most logical competitors, the networks, continue to be shut out,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, director of corporate communications for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Vietnam's Communist Party Will Tolerate No Challenge To Its Authority</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership has reaffirmed a need for reform but declared it will not tolerate any challenges to its authority or basic principles. Comprehensive reform requires efforts to `` broaden socialist democracy,'' but the party must tread carefully, party chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> told a March 20-29 conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, in a report Saturday on the plenum, quoted <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> as saying: `` All attempts aimed at weakening or nullifying the party's leadership and creating political counterweights to the party in society must definitely be checked. `` We do not allow those who take advantage of democracy and openness to attack the party and its leadership,'' he said. `` It is necessary to clearly distinguish constructive criticism from mud-slinging and instigating attempts aimed at lowering the prestige of the party and state.'' The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, reported <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said the leadership advocates enhancing the roles of state-supervised mass organizations and of elected organs like the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` We advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus through debate, but we do not tolerate pluralism,'' he declared. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>'s speech closed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s sixth plenum, held to review reforms endorsed at the national party congress in 1986. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> became party chief at the congress and three leaders identified with old policies retired. But Western analysts said party conservatives remain concerned that reforms may erode the dominant position of the party that achieved power after decades of fighting the French, Japanese and Americans and South Vietnamese anti-communists. Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> reported <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the party must avoid prejudice against private enterprises but also must not favor them `` without realizing their limits and spontaneity, which leads to lack of close management control.'' Without giving details, the broadcast reported <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said the state will promulgate laws stipulating which industries can not be run by private individuals. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s development requires increased commercial ties with non-socialist nations but that while ties were being expanded the party must watch out for `` negative influences.'' `` Once our door is open, not only will the pure and healthy air come in but dust, flies, and mosquitos also will follow,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> communique, also carried by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION>, said reforms were designed not to change the goal of socialism but to achieve it more quickly. It said the reform of the political system `` is meant to strengthen the party's role of leadership and the state's managerial efficacy and the people's right to mastery. The communique blamed the uneven pace of reform on the `` many shortcomings'' of the party leadership and the state, with authorities slow to implement party resolutions and to make needed changes in the party and state structures. In his comments on the economy, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> blamed inflation on the low output of state-run enterprises and the government's policy of subsidizing key areas of the economy. He said results of the reforms began to become visible in the third quarter of 1988 with more consumer goods and foodstuffs available, less strain in the grain supply and a slowing of the rate of price increases.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s journalistic establishment lampooned President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a white-tie dinner Saturday night as a `` pistol-packin' poppy'' whose idea of a kinder, gentler nation is `` a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> nearly stole the show with a grand entrance. Her snowy white hair was covered with a golden brown wig making the woman known as `` The Silver Fox'' almost unrecognizable. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were prime targets of the 104-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Gridiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, whose annual dinner is one of the biggest social events in the capital. The main business of the evening was to spoof the president and other prominent figures with humor designed to `` singe but never burn.'' By tradition, the responses by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the club members' satirical barbs were off the record. Yet just as traditionally that rule is ignored. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cracked `` people say I'm undecisive. I do n't know about that.'' Belittling his own skill at humor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if he had been funnier than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 _ when the two men competed for the Republican presidential nomination _ it would have been <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who was `` up here tonight trying to laugh off the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deficit.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the target of many jokes about his inexperience however he said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently praised his maturity and sense of responsibility by saying `` would you like a puppy'' from the brood delivered by first dog Millie. More than 600 invited guests included the journalists' bosses and a cross-section of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> power elite, including <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, governors and foreign ambassadors and their wives. Gridiron president <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> set the irreverent tone for the evening. Commenting good-naturedly on accomplishments of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, he asked in a prepared speech, `` What previous administration could say after 100 days that it had a new horseshoe pit?'' Then club members, portraying their victims in a series of satirical skits, roasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other prominent figures, including <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. A highlight of the prepared script was <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvidson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, who chided her husband for his initial opposition to controls on semiautomatic assault weapons. `` Lay that <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> down, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, lay that <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> down,'' sang the on-stage Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Pistol-packin' poppy, lay that <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> down.'' Later, a journalist posing as a White House speechwriter sang the `` Bush Battle Hymn'' with these words: `` Mine eyes have seen the glory of a kinder, gentler land, `` With a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand. `` Tiny tots in public schools will pledge allegiance on command, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in command.'' Then the Gridiron chorus sang: `` Sis-boom-bah and hallelujah, <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> will boola-boo ya. Read my lips so I can rule ya. You got ta read them right.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, took his lumps in a duet with former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, portrayed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of Media General. To the tune of `` I Believe In You,'' the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> stand-in sang: `` You're not the dim bulb I had been led to believe I would see. `` Are you an airhead dilettante lightweight? You sure could fool me. `` Cause I believe in you, I believe in you. `` I think you're perfectly qualified, `` As the Veep, you're swell. `` All my concerns have been mollified `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stays well.'' To which the chorus responds: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, stay well.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate who lost the November election to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was portrayed as <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> arriving at St. No Where Hospital for a personality transplant. Joined by dancers in prison stripes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sang a hip-swinging version of `` Jailhouse Rock'' in which he lamented the day he gave inmate <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> a weekend furlough. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program a major campaign issue against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Two new active members, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION>, were initiated into the 60-member club at Saturday's dinner, held in the Capital Hilton Hotel.

 A man who was the focus of a child-abuse investigation killed his live-in companion and a state police detective who came to their home, then shot himself to death Friday, authorities said. Detective <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> and the woman, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, had been talking in a police cruiser outside the couple's mobile home in this rural central <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> town when they were shot to death at around 10 a.m. The gunman, identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 36, died later while being transported from a <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> hospital to one in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> had lived in the home for several years, neighbors said. Although they had four children, only one _ an 18-year-old boy _ was living with them; the other children live with relatives, state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> was the subject of a child-abuse investigation that involved a 9-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> girl who was `` not a relative,'' <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> said. He also said <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> had an `` extensive criminal history.'' At the time of the shootings, <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> had gone to the mobile home to investigate the child abuse case, said state police Chief <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> called for backup assistance but had given no indication of an impending emergency, <PERSON> Demers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>, who neighbors said made a living selling merchandise at flea markets, apparently shot Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> with a hunting rifle that was found outside the home, police said. He then shot himself in the head. The backup officer arrived minutes later. `` The police have been there so many times,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaupre </PERSON>, a next-door neighbor. `` He was always in trouble. I do n't know why she stayed with him. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, a 13-year veteran of the state police who was promoted last August, was the seventh member of the force to be killed in the line of duty and the first since 1986. `` This is a very, very tragic day for the state police,'' <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> said at an impromptu news briefing not far from the scene. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said he was `` shocked and deeply saddened'' by the tragedy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is mostly mothballed, and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is flying. But both are attracting bids from billionaire business celebrities ranging from hoteliers to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> investors. People who saw `` Wall Street'' may have thought they were watching real-life variants of the back-room maneuvering for the movie's fictional <ORGANIZATION> Bluestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> if they followed accounts of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> this past week. The cast of contenders included baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, Hyatt hotel chain owner <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, property-casino centurion <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and energy-entertainment investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Others said to be involved, either as buyers or their lenders, included takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, reclusive <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, the former adviser to the dean of the corporate stalkers, oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. Miami-based Eastern remained comatose, its fate unclear, planes mostly grounded and assets increasingly mired in bankruptcy court proceedings, with little sign from parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that a sale was close. A group led by <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> had offered $ 464 million offer for the airline, which prior to the March 4 strike flew 100,000 passengers daily to 118 cities with 250 jetliners. Since then it has barely managed a skeleton schedule. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> reportedly offered a higher price, value unknown. But <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s offer told a story in itself about the perceived worth of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's most unprofitable airlines. The <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> deal was $ 200 million below the price <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> paid three years ago, and barely $ 100 million over what <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had offered for Eastern's Northeast shuttle, which flies to only three cities with about 20 planes. At Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, management was facing a $ 2.7 billion, $ 90-a-share takeover offer from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a second offer of undisclosed value from a group the airline would n't identify, and rumors that at least one other investor group was preparing to make a bid Not coincidentally, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> erected an anti-takeover `` poison pill'' shield to thwart unfriendly acquirers by making it prohibitively expensive for them to sell any of the airline's assets.

<HEAD>`Event Risk' Prompting Insurance Giants To Dump Corporate Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's called `` event risk,'' a euphemism for things that can damage the value of an investment. Corporate takeovers, restructurings and other such risks are prompting big life insurance companies to dump corporate bonds from their portfolios. The trend could spell trouble for the corporate bond market, since life insurance companies own about half the industrial bonds outstanding, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. A recent survey by the trade group found that 66 of its member companies had curtailed their purchase of certain high-grade corporate bonds. The reason is the fear of takeovers and restructurings of bond issuers that may damage the value of the the bonds. Such corporate makeovers typically result in a company taking on more debt. The increased debt load often prompts the bond-rating companies, such as <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to lower the ratings for the bonds because the increased debt raises questions about the companies' ability to make good on the bonds And when a bond's rating is lowered, its price usually falls. When asked whether they experienced any investment losses due to corporate restructurings since January 1986, 81 of the 108 life insurance companies that responded to the February survey said yes. During the three-year period covered by the survey, the insurance companies said the value of their corporate bonds dropped 12.6 percent because of corporate restructurings. `` Life insurers have a need for a good market and a good supply of investment-grade corporate bonds,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, director of investment research for the council. He said the companies need to ensure a steady stream of income from long-term investments such as bonds in order to pay off their policy claims. `` But for a number of years, life insurance companies have quietly been avoiding industrial bonds because of the problem of event risk, which is something that is difficult to assess in advance,'' he said in an interview last week. <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said life insurers had believed they could avoid exposing their investments to these risks by buying only the investment-grade bonds of the largest industrial companies, `` with the hope that they would be too big to be the target of a takeover attack.'' But the leveraged buyout of tobacco and food giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year blew that belief out of the water. `` The RJR buyout was the event which brought it to a head because it was so huge and it did result in large losses or reduction in market value -LRB- of bonds -RRB- to some insurance companies,'' he said. Some life insurers did more than just fume about their losses. They sued. The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the insurance unit of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, filed suit in November against <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> over its buyout plans. The suit, which is pending, alleges the insurer lost about $ 2.25 million in the value of its $ 25 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> bonds after the buyout was announced. `` We bought investment-grade securities in the spring, and by the fall they were trading as junk bonds,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s chief investment officer. For some time before the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> buyout the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> had been shifting out of corporate bonds, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. But that deal accelerated the trend, he said. In place of corporate bonds, life insurers are turning to other long-term investments, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. These include the mortgage-backed securities issued by several government agencies, bonds issued by foreign governments and utility company bonds _ none of which is at risk for takeover. <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said the corporate bond market may not yet be feeling the pinch from the changed investment stragegy of insurance companies because few long-term industrial bonds have been issued in recent months. But, he said, `` industrial companies will have to improve the terms -LRB- of their bonds -RRB- when they come to the market in the future when they market significantly larger quantities of debt.'' One way companies can improve their bonds is to include guarantees that they will not take on additional debt without bondholder approval. Such guarantees, called covenants, are becoming more common in corporate debt instruments as investors grow more wary of takeover aftershock. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he believed companies could find a way around these covenants, and so they may not be worth all that much. The lasting effect of the takeover craze, he said, may be the virtual demise of long-term corporate debt financing.

<HEAD>A Positive, But Wary First Quarter For Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market overcame a welter of worries to post some respectable gains in the first quarter of 1989. But misgivings about the financial and economic outlook are still very much in evidence as Wall Streeters look ahead to the remaining nine months of tho 10 percent range. If that kind of pace could be sustained over a year or two, it would qualify as a robust bull market. Yet little rejoicing has been heard in the investment community, which still evidently has n't quite gotten over the shock of the crash that occurred a year and a half ago. `` Since the great crash there has been no consistent theme or trend,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He describes the current mood of investors as one of `` pessimistic hope. `` The pessimism calls for a slowing economy and rising unemployment, whereas the hope is embedded in the belief this will cool inflation, diminish our trade imbalance and lower interest rates. `` The unlikelihood of all the preceding happening without a meaningful recession and sharply lower corporate profits has not gone unnoticed, however.'' Increased recession worries were evident from the behavior of diversified manufacturing, auto and machinery stocks, all of which ranked among the 10 worst performing industry groups for the quarter. In a compilation through March 29, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the manufacturing group was down 3.8 percent; the auto stocks dropped 2.6 percent, and the machinery group lost 1.5 percent. Over the same period, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index rose 5.3 percent, not counting dividends. Earnings worries, meanwhile, weighed heavily on technology stocks. The computer systems, electronic instrument, communications equipment and semiconductor groups all finished in the minus column. Some of the big winners _ such as the airlines, up 17.8 percent, and hospital management, up 20.2 percent _ got a lift from the continuing boom in takeover and buyout bids. For its part, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, with a 50.58 rise to 2,293.62 in the past week, closed out the quarter sporting a gain of 125.05 points, or 5.77 percent. Other readings for the week showed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index up 2.99 at 165.63; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market up 5.79 at 406.73, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index up 3.44 at 328.31. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 146.91 million shares a day, against 148.40 million the week before. The crux of the market's problems right now, many analysts agree, is persistently high interest rates. `` The current environment, in any historical perspective, is unattractive for equities,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerschner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` First, the relative safety of a guaranteed 10 percent one-year return stacks up well against the returns the equity market MIGHT deliver, even in the most benign environment. `` Second, the impact that these higher interest rates have in both depressing the corporate revenue line and increasing the corporate expense line suggests that the profit environment over the next few quarters might be far from benign. `` High interest rates have historically been a harbinger of a risky stock market, because they have been lead indicators of earnings disappointments.''

 Shed no tears for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> or his firm, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to plead guilty to fraud rather than face racketeering charges under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. These prosecutions have provoked misplaced criticism of the RICO law. RICO critics argue that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was unfairly induced to capitulate. Supposedly, any other decision would have meant instant ruin, since RICO allows assets to be frozen pretrial and forfeited after conviction. No doubt <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> felt pressured, but stress is inherent in the plea negotiation process. Thus, street criminals often plead guilty to avoid habitual offender charges. A more important issue is whether <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is guilty. The answer must be yes, for no judge may accept a baseless guilty plea. As the defense of `` good faith'' was readily available, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s megabuck legal team would not have advised a groundless plea. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> now has the same defense _ and others as well _ under <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION>. Nor was <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> abused by a pretrial asset freeze. This procedure, incidentally, is not unique to RICO. Other laws provide similar remedies comparable to bail bonds used to secure personal appearances at trial. No evidence suggests forfeiture was maliciously threatened. Moreover, prosecutors may not impose forfeiture unilaterally. RICO requires proof of probable success at trial and the risk of asset dissipation. Moreover, the court must consider various equitable factors. And not all assets may be frozen, only those needed to ensure funds for payoff upon conviction. The government is also justified in seeking forfeiture. Forfeiture takes the profit out of crime, a penalty that works well against corporations which can not be jailed. In <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s case, the alleged profits would make successful drug dealers envious. Surely the narcotics crisis is not to be solved by encouraging drug dealers to turn to securities fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reserved RICO for criminals who engage in a PATTERN of racketeering _ a requirement courts take seriously. Violators, therefore, merit special sanctions. White collar defendants claim to be unfairly stigmatized by the term racketeer. Perhaps `` swindler'' is more apt, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> properly considered white collar crimes to be racketeering. The legislative record is replete with references to corrupt businesses, including brokerage firms. Critics want to limit RICO to the Mafia. But white collar crime exacts equally serious social costs, and, constitutionally, we ought not tolerate efforts to confine racketeering laws to any ethnic group. Thus, though the case against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> remains to be proven, if guilt is established, the RICO penalty would fit the crime.

 The Red Queen from `` Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' might feel right at home in today's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sentence first, verdict afterward,'' was her theory of jurisprudence, an approach being adopted by overzealous Federal prosecutors with regard to the Racketeer Influenced and <ORGANIZATION> Corrupt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- RICO -RRB- law. The RICO law, enacted in 1970, contains two provisions to help prosecutors fight the kind of organized crime I used to cover as a young reporter at the <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Journal. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the RICO law to prosecute drug dealers and mob overlords whose entire business is a crime. It was not drafted to be used against legitimate businesses and individuals, who face irreparable damage to their reputation and assets _ and the stigma of being compared with <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> as a `` racketeer'' _ even before they are accused, much less convicted, of any wrongdoing. RICO works like this: Firstly, after an indictment it enables the government to seize a defendant's assets so that the ill-gotten gains can not be spent, laundered or siphoned into foreign bank accounts in the period between indictment and a trial. Secondly, after a conviction, RICO allows the seizure not only of the assets gained in the specific crime, but all those associated with the now-proven racketeering enterprise. To a legitimate business enterprise or individual, who is presumed innocent and ultimately may be shown to have committed no crime at all, the prospect of RICO prosecution is staggering. Prosecutors know this, of course, and have used RICO as a bludgeon to coerce guilty pleas from the unindicted and exact tremendous penalties on the unconvicted. <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> may well have been able to win on the merits of the government's case against the firm, a case the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney has been notably loathe to bring to court. But because a RICO charge would shut off <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s overnight bank credit and put it out of business in a single day, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> faced ruination from even a RICO charge. So <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six felonies rather than risk RICO indictment, certain bankruptcy and putting its 10,000 employees out of work. In other words, the guilty plea was extorted. The latest victim of RICO abuse is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, a visionary investment banker who inspired a wave of entrepreneurial activity in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the past decade and helped create jobs for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Notwithstanding the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he is being treated like a drug dealer mobster, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney is trying to seize his entire salary for the years 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. Even though <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> resolutely denies any wrongdoing _ and, unlike <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, is going to fight the charges in court _ and even though the alleged actions with which he is charged accounted for only a small fraction of his earnings during this period _ the government wants to take every penny he has earned during this time and jail him for `` hundreds of years.'' In the meantime, the government has used RICO to force <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> out of his job, freeze his personal assets and effectively put him out of business. And still no trial, much less a conviction. RICO, then, seems to have turned the American judicial presumption of innocence on its head. The <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> case has developed into a civil rights issue, in which RICO is used to coerce settlements the government evidently feels it can not win in court on the evidence confessed felon <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> traded for a lenient sentence. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is being presumed guilty and severely punished without trial under a law written to prevent drug dealers from hiding their loot.
