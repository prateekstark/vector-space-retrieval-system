 The yellow police tape surrounding the sprawling one-story brick school provided a jarring note on the quiet, tree-lined, sunny street with its comfortable homes. But the tranquility of this affluent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> community had already been shattered by a shooting rampage that left an 8-year-old boy dead and five other children and an adult critically wounded. The children were shot at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in a 15-minute assault by a woman Friday morning in a school restroom and in a second-grade classroom. The woman barricaded herself in a neighboring home and was found dead by police later in the day. Police said she shot herself once in the head with a .32 - caliber School District 36 Superintentent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, his shirt stained with blood, tried to reassure anxious parents who gathered outside, and the crowd dispersed quickly. `` There were a lot of mothers trying to get to the school'' immediately afterward, said a resident of the neighborhood, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmont </PERSON>. `` They're all crying on my front lawn,'' said another resident, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Prange </PERSON>. `` These things happen 2,000 miles away. They do n't happen next door to you,'' said a third resident, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosler </PERSON>. After the classroom shooting, the drama shifted to the nearby home, where a young man was shot and the suspect, identified as 30-year-old <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, barricaded herself inside. `` I just heard police surrounding the house, calling, ` <PERSON> Lori </PERSON>, let's get it over with.' I did n't hear any response. Then I heard a shot, a blast I would say,'' said <PERSON> Hildegard </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstoetter </PERSON>, a housekeeper at the home next door. The afternoon dragged into evening. Reporters were kept behind a police line. Trees obscured the houses. Dozens of police officers waited in the street, and squad cars came and went. After eight hours, <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> announced Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had been found dead in the house. Village residents talked of little else. Teen-agers sitting on cars in a local gas station were discussing the events, and a man sat in his garage listening to developments on a police radio. The boy's death was only the third slaying in his community since 1957, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. `` We never have a drill for something like this. But we do have fire and tornado drills, so the kids were on the floor in the other classrooms'' after the shooting, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said. Standing outside the school at the end of the day, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Romey </PERSON> said his 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, was in another classroom when the shooting occurred. `` I'm relieved to hear our child is safe. It's a tragedy. It's just terrible for the family who lost their child,'' he said `` The kids are calm,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON>, adding that school officials `` told us to take them home and let them talk because they've been talked to a lot today.'' `` The school system here is known for being fantastic, and they have handled this whole thing fantastically,'' Ms. <PERSON> Romey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> `` is a fabulous school _ one of the best in the country. ... It's a family neighborhood,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Belmont </PERSON>, who lives nearby with two pre-school-age children. The shady suburb north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is nestled on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and marked by large homes and comfortable incomes. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaskey </PERSON> lives there, as do numerous <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> realty barons, bankers and industrialists.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s attorney general took initial steps Friday toward investigating Gov. Rose Mofford's expenditures of thousands of dollars in state funds on gifts and decorations when she was secretary of state. Some of the spending appears to have lacked legislative authorization, according to records and interviews with officials, although the governor and a close aide said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had approved the funds. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s office issued a statement saying she `` stands behind'' all the expenditures. Press aide <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON> said the governor would not hold a news conference on the issue because, `` I do n't think there's anything serious enough to have a press conference over.'' The governor, in a brief interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> KFYI </ORGANIZATION> said `` I never misspent a penny. It was appropriated for VIP gifts and I used it for that type of purpose. I never used anything for personal gain.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, 65, became governor April 4 when <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office upon being convicted in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial of misusing state funds and obstructing justice. Records examined by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> showed that Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s gift expenditures totaled at least $ 50,000 for her last five years as secretary of state. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> used state funds to pay for such things as a joke-writing service and diet food as well as paintings, watches, Indian kachina dolls, clocks, flags and knickknacks, typically charging them to `` other operating expenses'' or `` supplies.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he would wait to hear from Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> before deciding whether to launch an impeachment probe. Since <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> is next in line to succeed Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, he already had turned over to <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> an investigation of her financial disclosure practices. That investigation stemmed from an AP report that while secretary of state she had failed to include a number of her business dealings in the state-required reports. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> had agreed to investigate the gift expenditures as well. He added that whether any criminal or civil action will be taken will depend on what <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> finds. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> did not respond to AP queries about the gifts and spoke only briefly to <ORGANIZATION> KFYI </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this month, she had said that when faced with the need to present gifts to important visitors as secretary of state, she `` took care of it myself.'' `` I've paid for a lot of my dinners and all those artifacts and things that are there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> continued. `` Only gifts _ we have a fund for VIP gifts that we are permitted to use that was appropriated by the Legislature. Other than that, I pay for it out of my own pocket.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state, said the expenditures had been authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as early as 1980 when Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> requested permission to spend $ 5,000 to make some kind of presentation to visiting dignitaries `` on behalf of the state.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s official records show $ 2,400 in unspecified `` other'' expenses was approved that year and $ 2,500 in 1981. More recently, the Legislature has provided lump-sum allocations for the secretary of state's office with little direction as to how the funds are divided. The budget this year is $ 1.9 million. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Drobny </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s staff analyst for the secretary of state's office in 1980, said she did n't believe the $ 2,400 was for gifts but that she could not recall what it was for. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> also said he did n't know the money was for gifts. He added that he could understand some of the purchases but that buying a joke service or diet food `` blows my mind.'' The state constitution bars the state from giving anything of value to an individual without public benefit, and state law makes unauthorized expenditures of public funds a felony. Mrs. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said she considered that gifts Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> gave as secretary of state did result in a public benefit, because they were aimed at pleasing someone who could bring business to the state, were in recognition of service to the state or were aimed at motivating future conduct. Records for use of state funds the past five years ago show that as secretary of state, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> spent about $ 9,000 on pens and other novelties with her name on them, about $ 6,400 on 30 watches bearing the state seal, and about $ 5,700 on kachina and other dolls and their display cases. The total also included about $ 11,000 for flags, mostly state and national, some of which were bought from unauthorized vendors at higher prices than those paid to authorized vendors for similar flags. Other expenditures included $ 203.70 for a weight-reduction product shipped to a friend and business partner of Mrs. Mofford, and $ 306 for the five years' annual renewal of a joke service that promises to supply speakers with 120 to 140 new jokes and stories a month. Mrs. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> called that `` probably the greatest tool in the world'' since `` nobody wants to hear a dull, totally dry speech.'' As for the diet food, Mrs. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said she did n't know anything about it. A 1978 protocol-fund statute allows the governor, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president to make gifts that promote state interests and encourage public service. It does not include the secretary of state. After she became governor, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she wanted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s privately raised protocol fund _ money he was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of misusing _ placed in the state General Fund that comes from tax revenues `` I would not have a protocol fund, period,'' she said. `` I do n't want one.''

 A whole class of fourth-graders whose teacher failed to make the grade must go to summer school before they can be promoted, says their principal, one of four who tried unsuccessfully to fire the teacher. `` It is really a joke that the system allows this to happen,'' said <PERSON> Dyanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandridge-Alexander </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Spencer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> teaches. `` Those children deserve a better teacher, a better education.'' <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> `` has not handed in a lesson plan all year,'' <PERSON> Dandridge-Alexander </PERSON> said, `` and when you ask her about it, she says ` I left it at home.' `` The noise level in the class is unbelievable. Kids are fighting. Children are rolling around on the floor. They are throwing chairs across the room. One day I walked into her classroom and said, ` Did you see that chair fly across the room?' and she said, ` I told them not to do that.''' The city's schools are saddled with too many students and too little money, and the result too often is chaos, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> concluded after a seven-month examination of a system that Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has called the worst in the nation. In addition, a lenient administration, a powerful teachers union and a misguided state law have created an environment that protects incompetent teachers and ignores the children the teachers are supposed to educate, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in its weeklong series on the system. The newspaper found that of 139 teachers who, over the last five years, were so lacking in attendance, discipline, teaching ability or relationships with their students that their principals moved to fire them, 99 are still in the classroom. `` I am part of the problem, but remember, you ca n't expect miracles when you have low achievers,'' said <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>, 56, who has taught for 30 years. `` There always will be discipline problems in that class,'' said <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>, whose most recent assignment is at <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>, in an impoverished neighborhood on the city's near <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` It's the kind of children I teach. During her career, <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> has received at least 12 `` excellent'' ratings and five `` superior'' ratings. But she also has received four unsatisfactory ratings since the 1983-84 school year, the last this March from <LOCATION> Dandridge-Alexander </LOCATION>, the newspaper reported. Since a new state law took effect in January, an unsatisfactory rating is the first step in the termination procedure, which could take a year or longer. The newspaper reported three of <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>'s principals attempted to have her fired under previous guidelines <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> her career goal now is retiring `` at full pension.'' She did not return phone messages left for her at the school Thursday. `` Incompetent teachers are a disservice to everyone, especially the teaching profession,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdeen </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Any principal who says he ca n't get rid of an obviously bad teacher is either lazy or must think assassination is the only answer. `` Secondly, those who are critical of urban school systems are usually the ones like <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, who are taking away the very same resources needed to meet the tremendous needs of these kids,'' he said. <PERSON> Dandridge-Alexander </PERSON> said she is n't concerned as much with blame as she is with correcting the problem. Last month she called parents in to monitor <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>'s classes, and `` they are at a point where they think it is hopeless,'' she said. Because of the new state law giving teachers rated unsatisfactory a year's work before they can be dismissed, <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> will be able to continue teaching until at least March 1989. The new law was part of a 1985 state school reform package, its intent to give school management better tools to weed out weak teachers. But lobbying by teachers unions made the law into yet another measure making it even more difficult to fire teachers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a terrible shame,'' said <PERSON> Dandridge-Alexander </PERSON>. `` Those children have suffered because they have a totally inept teacher that no one has been able to fire.''

<TEXT>
 With a little financial help from abroad and a lot of enthusiasm from 200,000 volunteers, opponents of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government have launched a campaign they say will keep fraud out of this year's presidential election. Ten opposition parties, from left to right, have united in the campaign of door-to-door voter education, poll-watching on election day and independent vote counting afterward. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> maintain that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a 1980 plebiscite to approve a government-drafted constitution. <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, secretary general of the command, said the 1980 plebiscite, in which the government received 67 percent of the vote, `` lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any honest election.'' That vote took place without voter registries, because the old ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized power in 1973. Polling stations were manned only by government-appointed officials, without any opposition or independent supervision. <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON> said a national census taken two years after the vote showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities. The government has denied accusations of fraud. `` The upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different,'' <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON> said. He said voter registries now have reopened, `` and this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote.'' In the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this year, Chileans will be able to vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single, military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 presidential term. If the candidate is rejected by voters, a competitive election will take place a year later. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the 73-year-old army commander who has ruled since 1973, is considered the most likely candidate. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a key member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said 700 specialists are training the 200,000 volunteers throughout the country to work as poll-watchers on election day. He added in an interview that the opposition will be able to have three to five monitors at each of the 20,000 or so voting places. `` We can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be properly accounted for, and that it will remain secret,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. Some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of voters in the door-to-door campaign to `` explain to them that this time the vote will be totally clean,'' he said. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> added that part of the financing for the campaign has come `` from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' He said the cost is relatively low, however. He estimated his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will spend the equivalent of around $ 100,000. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> did no identify the foreign groups sending money, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> and several West European foundations, especially in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, have been officially reported in the past as granting financial aid to Chilean democratic dissident groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> also has organized a nationwide computerized vote-counting system to operate independently of the government system. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, an engineer in charge of the Vote Counting Center said `` we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of the vote and complete returns.'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Campana </PERSON>, a leading electoral expert of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the opposition, said, `` The system we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote. There will be no fraud this time. Chileans can rest assured of that.'' <PERSON> Campana </PERSON> said volunteers trained as poll-monitors show `` an enormous enthusiasm.'' `` Many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses connected with the campaign out of their own pockets.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>, who works at the Vote Counting Center, said, however, old legislation granting the government emergency powers could still be invoked. `` That legislation, for example, would allow the government to prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering,'' <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> said. That, said <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, is `` the only fraud possibility that remains open.''

 This week's riots make clear that the militant political opposition remains strong despite substantial democratic reforms. Thousands of students and dissidents opposed to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government battled police in the streets. Protest leaders claimed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is not a democracy, as they had during the authoritarian regime of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s predecessor and ally, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Protesters chanted: `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' and `` Destroy the murder regime!'' They hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police during the most violent unrest in months. The scale was much smaller than the huge protests of last summer but the scenes and slogans were the same, demonstrating that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics remain turbulent despite the professed desire of all parties to build a stable democratic system. Anti-American sentiment, always present in political protests, seemed particularly evident this time. `` Yankee go home!'' was shouted along with `` Execute <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' Protesters burned a homemade American flag and attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center. Opposition groups, especially radical students, remain eager to take their causes into the streets. The government still limits some political activity and is quick to use riot police to break up protests. Many South Koreans still distrust <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> because he helped <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power in 1980, when both were army generals, and played a prominent role in <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s regime, serving as chairman of the government <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That wariness was reflected in <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s slender victory in the December presidential election over a divided opposition, and the government party's loss of its majority in parliamentary elections last month. Opposition groups demand an investigation of his role in suppression of the 1980 <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising, in which at least 191 people were killed. This week's protests marked the eighth anniversary, on Wednesday, of the revolt in the southern city. In addition to being far smaller than those that forced <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> to hold elections, the latest protests have attracted little public support and there is little sign that they will become a threat to the government. The 1987 protests mushroomed into mass demonstrations almost overnight, however, and political observers avoid firm predictions about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics. When <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as president in February, it was the first peaceful transfer of power in the nation's 40-year history. All indications are that both the government and the main opposition parties want to avoid major political unrest before the Olympic Games are held here in September. South Koreans see the games as a national triumph that will give the nation a place on the world stage. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has worked hard to build public confidence. He promised to introduce full democracy while ensuring political stability, and has made significant changes. Many curbs on politics imposed by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> have been removed, creating a sharp contrast to 1987, when riot police took harsh action to disperse even minor peace; ful demonstrations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> tries to project himself as a `` common man'' and has discarded much of the presidency's aloofness. Press curbs have been removed, most forms of self-expression are allowed and opposition parties operate freely. Some political controls still apply, however. Street protests against the government still are likely to be broken up and scores of dissidents remain in jail, serving long sentences for political activity. Many South Koreans feel real democracy is not possible until control by the military, government bureaucracy, big business and other powerful factions is ended. People in the streets complain that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has yet to deliver on election promises of major social and economic reforms, including doubling pay for industrial workers and the poor. A more fundamental problem lies in the traditional <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> belief that compromise is the greatest sign of weakness. Political factions believe only one point of view is right and all others must be defeated or even destroyed. Political leaders on all sides agree such an outlook blocks the road to democracy, but seem unable to change it.

 The surrender of Sikh extremists in their sacred <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> did not end the war of terror through which they hope to create a nation called <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, the Land of the Pure. During the 10 days Sikh gunmen and their sympathizers spent inside the temple complex, surrounded by about 2,800 policemen and soldiers, their comrades killed 133 people in the holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Twenty-five more people were reported killed Thursday, the day after the surrender at the temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. They included two Hindu priests and a Sikh holy man. It is from <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich northern agricultural state, that the radicals would create <PERSON> Khalistan </PERSON>. It is the only state where Sikhs, who make up only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people, are in the majority. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON>, former police chief of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and now security adviser to the state government, was asked if the surrender indicated an end to terrorism. He replied: `` No, far from it.'' Bomb disposal squads searched for hidden explosives Thursday in the 400-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the holiest shrine of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>. Police said four more bodies were found inside, bringing the death toll of the siege to 46. A committee of Sikh elders that manages the temple conferred about preparations to reopen the gold-domed shrine. Sikh extremists began fighting for a separate homeland six years ago, accusing the Hindu-dominated federal government of discrimination and of hampering economic development in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Thousands of people have been killed since then. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> signed a peace agreement with moderate Sikhs in 1985, but it fell apart within a year. The Sikh extremists, initially blamed for scattered killings, have attacked loaded buses, sleeping villagers and congested markets in recent years. At least 1,088 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year, compared to 1,032 for all 1987. Most victims are Hindus, but an increasing number of Sikh moderates are being slain. Police estimate the radicals have more than 3,000 men under arms, with increasingly sophisticated weapons. The greatest fear of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government is that the separatist movement will become a full-scale civil war and encourage insurgencies among other minorities. `` So far, the terrorists are a small section of the population,'' one official said privately. `` We want to keep it that way.'' Support for the extremists within the Sikh community may be waning. After an army raid on the Golden Temple complex in 1984, angry Sikhs held rallies. But hardly any Sikhs objected publicly to the siege of the temple that ended Wednesday, and a gathering of Sikh temple managers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> passed a resolution Wednesday praising the government's `` rescue'' of the shrine. Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered the 1984 raid to drive out extremists taking shelter in the temple. About 1,200 people were killed. Two of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Sikh guards assassinated her five months later. Prominent Sikhs generally believe the violence will continue until the government of <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON>'s son and successor, reaches a political compromise with the militants. <PERSON> Kushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a respected Sikh writer, urged the government recently to abandon its practice of searching for a single moderate Sikh to lead peace efforts. `` What we have to find is not a person or persons to lead the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, but -LRB- a way -RRB- to set out principles of conduct and stick to them no matter what the immediate consequences,'' he wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He advocated release of hundreds of Sikhs detained without trial, prosecution of Hindu politicians and others accused of instigating the anti-Sikh riots in 1984, and new investment to stimulate <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s faltering economy. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s 1985 accord with moderates called for settlement of land and water disputes between <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state, investigation of the 1984 riots and speedy handling of arrest and detention cases. He put <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> under federal rule in May 1987, after the agreement had failed, but in March of this year returned to a softer approach and ordered the release from prison of militant Sikh high priest <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>. Rode was arrested last week trying to march on the temple to end the police siege.

<TEXT>
 Like the one that got away, the Great Anglers' Strike of'88 is assured of an honorable place in the folklore of Irish fishing. It is a tale of defiance, anger and of farce tinged with menace. It invokes the memory of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s freedom wars, reflects rural resentment against big-city bureaucrats, and climaxes with an 11th-hour truce mediated by an archbishop. And all because of a fishing license. The trouble began on New Year's Day, when a law took effect requiring anglers, for the first time, to buy licenses. At 15 pounds -LRB- $ 26.50 -RRB- for a year's trout fishing and 10 pounds -LRB- $ 15.60 -RRB- for other fish, the permits are n't exorbitant or unusual for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the anglers were outraged. They threatened to shut down angling and deal a severe blow to western <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s multimillion dollar tourism industry unless the license law was withdrawn. The government refused, and in mid-April the strike began. Signs popped up along roads and at fishing venues saying `` No Rod License'' and `` Licensed Anglers Not Welcome Here.'' Angling clubs declared their waters off-limits to fishers. Hotels told guests with bookings to stay away. Fishing stores refused to sell the licenses. Dark tales circulated of anglers' car tires being slashed and a fishing boat being sawed in half. True or not, they had the desired effect. By mid-May, as the lakes and rivers swarmed with trout feasting on the newly hatched mayflies, not an angler was in sight, and all angling competitions were canceled. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Munster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says it's not the money, but the principle. `` We believe we have a God-given right to fish,'' said the 54-year-old pub owner, smacking the dashboard of his car. `` I want to hand down to my children and grandchildren what my forefathers gave to me _ the right to fish over these waters for free.'' In the tiny <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kildorrery </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>' friend <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> harked back 70 years to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s war for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` My father and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s father put their lives on the line fighting for our freedom, and freedom includes the right to fish,'' he said. `` It's a battle for control,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` We anglers have developed these waters, cleaned up pollution, restocked them, without one penny in government aid, and we want to keep it that way.'' Commented lawmaker <PERSON> Enda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>: `` In the land of Capt. -LRB- Charles -RRB- <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON>, attitudes have become deeply entrenched,'' a reference to the 19th-century land agent who lost his crops to a peasants' boycott and gave his name to the English language The debt-ridden economy urgently needs cash, and the government sees nothing wrong with the angling licenses. But its attitude is under attack. `` It is government by diktat rather than by any sort of consensus,'' charged the <ORGANIZATION> Cork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. `` This whole matter has been handled in a very nonsensical manner.'' Indeed, the law passed so quickly and with so little fanfare that the government tourism agency did n't have time to alter its latest promotional literature, which still says Irish waters are license-free. Meanwhile, the $ 60 million annual tourism industry in western <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> says hotels catering to anglers have been hit hard by cancellations. `` We are facing ruin at the moment,'' said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, who runs a classy anglers' hotel on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corrib </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION>. `` It's devastating, heartbreaking to look out over an empty lake and see no boats,'' she said Tuesday. Unbeknownst to her, however, higher powers were working to get the anglers and the government off the hook. Late Wednesday, the Archbishop of <LOCATION> Tuam </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, announced he had secretly negotiated a deal whereby the licensing law would not be implemented until further discussion. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON> of the Anti-Rod-Licensing Campaign saw this as a face-saving compromise and said the boats would return to Corrib later. But <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> remained suspicious. `` I do n't see any government commitment to repeal the law, so for the time being our strike is still on,'' he said. `` This is a tax on our sport,'' he said. `` If they get away with this, next year it'll be the tennis racket, then the golf club, then the hurling stick. You know governments. Once they get one leg in, it's all over. Next year they'll double it, then treble it.''

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, armed with Colombian contacts and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street education, turned a prison cell fantasy into the world's first high-tech cocaine-smuggling ring, authorities say. At the height of his power in the early 1980s, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a key figure in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the Colombian drug-trafficking ring responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this country, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments. He was convicted Thursday on all 11 counts of smuggling lodged against him. `` <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was one of the four managers for the multibillion-dollar cartel,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` He had hundreds of millions of dollars pass through his bank accounts in a short period of time.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> owned an island in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, gave television interviews from a Colombian jungle hideaway, showed a fondness for <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and even organized his own political party to fight `` <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. imperialism.'' In a 1985 interview from the jungle, where he was a fugitive, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> called his nation's stimulants the Achilles' heel of imperialism. `` If coke, coal or marijuana, or gold, or diamonds, or coffee or whatever we have, is going to provide a cornerstone for us to remove imperialism from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, well then, so be it,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities kept pressing the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government, and on Feb. 4, 1987, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was captured for extradition by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government after a short firefight outside a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mansion. He wound up in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> facing a federal jury. Trial testimony, drug agents and prosecutors painted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as a pioneer in drug trafficking with a grand design to traffic tons of cocaine through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Son of a German father and <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> mother, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coffee-growing region of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, then moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at age 15. His brushes with the law began a few years later. In 1974, he was sentenced to the federal correctional insitution in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for auto theft and marijuana possession. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and a prison mate talked about cocaine as the wave of the future, and pored over an atlas to find a small island they could buy as a waystation, authorities said. After he was deported to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 1975, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> allegedly began smuggling cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in small amounts, concealing it in the lining of suitcases. Soon he was hiring other `` mules,'' and graduated to using large, long-range planes to fly several hundred kilograms at a time out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> established his base on <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, a small <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> characterized as `` an aircraft carrier of cocaine.'' His occupation of the island was allegedly blessed by Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> after a series of bribes, according to trial testimony. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> has denied the allegation, and has not been charged. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a businessman who wanted to develop the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island as a resort for wealthy Europeans and South Americans. They introduced into evidence a promotional film made by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> which extolled the island's virtues. But according to trial testimony, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> soon was flying shipments from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay to small airstrips in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had a lot in common,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said in his closing arguments. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was the pioneer of the mass transportation of cocaine for the American consumer.'' Like many pioneers, money was not <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s only objective. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also viewed cocaine as a revolutionary tool. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovac </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1976, said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> `` wanted to build a kingdom based on cocaine. ... He pretty much thought he was going to take on the world.'' Outside <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s Bavarian-style resort of <PERSON> Posada </PERSON> <PERSON> Alemana </PERSON> stands a symbolically bullet-pocked nude statue of his hero, slain former Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. At his trial, several witnesses testified that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also idolized <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and kept swastikas, the symbol of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in his home. By 1982, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was spending most of his free time back in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, developing a resort, buying ranches, starting a newspaper and forming a political party. He railed against the U.S.-Colombian extradition treaty, since voided by that nation's <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION>, calling it an example of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialism. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents say <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was active in the drug-related violence that swept <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, working with guerrilla forces to arrange the assassination of government officials who opposed the drug trade. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s operation began to unravel when Bahamian forces and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> began to focus on <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, with the help of marijuana smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who had joined forces with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1978 after meeting him on the island.

 The former president of a <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottler and the chairman of the company that once owned a rival <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling operation have been convicted of price fixing by a federal jury. Sentencing for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cheverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, has not been set. The two face a maximum of three years in prison. They were convicted Thursday of conspiring to set the wholesale price of their products between February 1983 and the fall of 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> was the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the six-week trial, prosecutors sought to show that both companies enjoyed higher profits because of the artifical inflation of their wholesale prices. They provided no estimate of cost to the consumer. `` They did n't want a price war ... and gave a green light to price-fixing,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the defendants. A third executive indicted, <PERSON> Odis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty March 22 to one count of price fixing. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> met numerous times with other soft-drink executives to scheme about boosting wholesale prices of both <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. The defense contended that <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> were unaware of what was happening, and were hostile competitors who had fought each other in court and in the marketplace. The indictments came out of a wide-ranging <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe of the soft drink industry. In March, <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> agreed to refund $ 45,000 to state and local governments for cola bought by school districts during the time of the alleged price fixing.

 A white former police officer, acquitted of state charges in the 1983 shooting death of a black man, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury for civil rights violations in the same shooting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said the indictment charges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> with shooting <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, 18, in the back on Aug. 31, 1983. The federal charges accuse <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> of violating <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>'s civil rights. The maximum penalty in the federal case would be life in prison. <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemann </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said he would try to get the indictment dismissed on the grounds that it subjects <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> to double jeopardy. <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> would not say whether any new evidence was uncovered in the federal investigation. Asked why it took so long to bring the federal charges, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> would say only that prosecutors had been watching post-trial developments and felt the time finally had come to move on the case. He said federal officials were interested in the case because `` the boy was shot in the back riding on the back of a motorcycle fleeing from what was at worst a traffic arrest.'' Also, <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> and his partner admitted that they planted a gun near the scene to make it appear that the shooting was in self-defense, he said. <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, the son of a policewoman, was a passenger behind the driver of a speeding motocycle that <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> and his partner were chasing. <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> testified during the trial that he thought he was being fired upon and that his own gun went off when the police car accelerated. His partner, who testified in exchange for immunity, said no one fired from the cycle. <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON>, a nine-year officer, was suspended from the police force after the shooting and was fired three months later. He was charged in state court and convicted of second-degree murder in 1984. The verdict was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and <PERSON> Rosiere </PERSON> was aquitted in a second trial in 1986. He works as a carpenter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.

 The transcontinental custody dispute over the 5-year-old son of actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> awaits a decision by an English court, says the attorney for the child's mother. `` We're waiting to see whether <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has jurisdiction over the child,'' said <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Somerville </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>'s former girlfriend.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> basked on Thursday in the praise of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who called him `` an important part of everything we have achieved in this so-called revolution.'' The vice president also received a dispensation of sorts from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to disagree with the president's policies. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Thursday, `` He has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and that's fine.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting sources, reported in Friday's editions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged at a high-level meeting of administration policymakers that negotiations with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be ended. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Thursday night he had no knowledge of any such recommendation by the vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met held a private evening meeting with civil rights leaders at his official residence. The vice president's chief of staff told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked the black leaders to `` share open discussion with him.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called it a `` very good session.'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and one of the participants, said a wide range of issues was discussed. But Hooks said: `` At this point I'd say the vice president has a long way to go if he actually expects to get a substantial black vote.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, who also attended the meeting, said the fact that the meeting had taken place was in itself important. `` This is the first meeting of this type in some eight years, and that is significant,'' he said. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> told a recent news conference that the group was trying to set up a similar session with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, a supporter of Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said, `` Any candidate who wins will have to come to get the black votes. Neither -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- has demonstrated that he has the capacity to get black voters.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who officially endorsed his vice president two weeks ago, made his comments in an interview with foreign broadcasters. `` I have to say that the vice president has been an important part of everything that we have achieved in this so-called revolution in these seven years or so,'' he said. `` I have always believed that vice presidents in our system of government were relegated to a kind of just standing and waiting position, and I think that's a waste of talent. I have always believed that your vice president should be like a vice president in a private corporation. He should be an executive with duties and functions.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s work at the helm of task forces, one on reducing regulations and another on drugs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman took pains to make clear that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his own man and was free to differ from administration policy. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> spoke a day after comments by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides suggested a break with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the question of dismissing drug-trafficking indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I wo n't bargain with terrorists and I wo n't bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or foreign soil,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and that's fine,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` As we go through this campaign, I would expect to see the vice president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he would do,'' he said. `` I expect a number of them will be different than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way. If you want to drive a wedge between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the vice president, forget it.'' In the interview with foreign broadcasters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparent effort to distance himself from White House policy on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I can see why the vice president said what he said,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the interview. `` Because the impression has been given, based not on information from us, but based on rumors and news leaks and so forth, that we are in negotiations over, with a participant in the drug trade and all. And I think he was making himself plain that you do n't negotiate with people of that kind.'' The president said his talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were not about his involvement in the drug trade. `` Our goal, what we're trying to achieve, is the restoration of democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> still hopes to launch the first post-Challenger space shuttle in August, but the agency is uncertain whether it can meet a goal of nine flights next year, the head of the shuttle program says. The reason for the doubt is the explosion that destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, on May 4. The explosion eliminated the source of half the nation's supply of a chemical used for the shuttle boosters and some other rockets A second plant in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION>, has shut down for inspections to see that it is safe. Pacific Engineering and <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> were the only American companies manufacturing ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer. The oxidizer makes sure the solid rocket fuel burns evenly. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, associate administrator for space flight of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that rocket-maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> has enough ammonium perchlorate on hand for four flights and there is enough on hand for a fifth rocket set. The Titan 4 also uses ammonium perchlorate. The chemical, in the form of white crystals, is taken by rail car to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, mixed there, and poured into the segments that make the booster rockets. `` The issue will first come up in 1989, but we're not certain there is going to be an impact in 1989 until we get together with the <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to match requirements and availability,'' Truly said. He said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will have to decide how to divide up the output of <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION>. He said the first post-Challenger flight still is on schedule for launch in late August. He insisted the agency had not set a firm date but is working toward a target of Aug. 22. Pacific Engineering said the explosion, which killed two people and injured 326 was caused by a natural gas leak. Pacific Engineering and <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> each produced 30 million pounds per year of ammonium perchlorate. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the company has n't ruled out buying ammonium perchlorate from foreign firms but added: `` The rest of the world supply is pretty meager I've seen estimates of worldwide production of nine million pounds a year.'' A pair of shuttle booster rockets uses 1.5 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate per flight.

<HEAD>Administration Wary of Giving Military Drug-Arrest Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman says the administration is wary of giving military personnel drug-trafficking arrest powers because `` you cross an enormous bridge when you move them'' to an enforcement role. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Thursday did not directly oppose a bill passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to make arrests on the high seas, but he said the administration is `` very cautious in that area.'' `` I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would want us to be cautious,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But that does not diminish the idea that there are expanded roles for the military.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, oppose attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to substantially change a military role which now consists primarily of surveillance. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about a change <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made in a speech Wednesday on the subject. The prepared remarks had called for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to say he had directed <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to search for `` creative solutions on how we can better use military resources and technologies to detect and interdict drugs coming into this country.'' But when he actually delivered the speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> changed that line to say he wanted <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to find better ways for the military `` to detect drugs and support civil law enforcement agencies in interdiction.'' Asked about the significance of the change, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There is a very great concern about what it means to make law enforcement officers out of the military.'' `` You cross an enormous bridge when you move them from providing military support and surveillance and physical interdiction efforts to making arrests and legal judgments and so forth,'' he said. `` As I think it was, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> -RRB- the other day said, ` The first time an F-15 shoots down a dentist because his -LRB- airplane -RRB- radio does n't work, you begin to understand the dimensions of the problem.'' The chamber last Friday voted 83-6 for an amendment outlining a wide-ranging anti-drug role for the military. The proposal calls for more surveillance by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planes, increased anti-drug activity by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and more <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> helicopters for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The most controversial provision would require <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels to track suspected drug boats and would allow <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers to arrest suspected drug traffickers in international waters. The officers would be temporarily `` deputized'' by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers who would be aboard for that purpose. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, however, likened the drug trade to `` a 30-foot tidal wave hitting a 25-foot wall'' and said, `` The fact is that interdiction is never going to solve the problem without cutting the demand.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he considers Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a friend as well as an adversary and says the West should applaud whatever reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can achieve. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also says he believes `` it is evident'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is encountering opposition from forces `` who want to cling to what are more the Stalinist policies'' of yesteryear. Providing a rare insight to the private talks the two have had in recent years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told foreign broadcasters Thursday that strains in superpower relations have not harmed their personal relationship. Asked if he considered <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a friend, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` Well, I ca n't help but say yes to that. ... Yes, we can debate and we disagree. But there is never a sense of personal animus when the arguments are over.'' While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to prove that his `` glasnost'' campaign of openness is genuine, he said the West should encourage the move toward change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` If there's any way that outside nations could be helpful in this, they should,'' he said, `` because many of the reforms that he has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always criticized in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` And if there is a way to be helpful in that, certainly, to at least acknowledge our approval of what he is doing, that we should do that.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s obliging tone came on a day in which the president continued to receive briefings in preparation for his May 29-June 2 summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president also made these points in a wide-ranging interview: _ `` I believe there is a desire in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to settle once and for all what is still technically a state of war between the Arab nations and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He said the purpose of an international peace conference would be to aid the parties but not to `` dictate a settlement'' and said any Soviet role in such a conference would likely have to be preceded by a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> decision to resume relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. _ He hopes that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has heard some of the things that I have been saying'' about former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s accusation that astrology played a role in official business, saying that `` no decision was ever made by me on the basis of astrology. _ Clandestine sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to elements in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during parts of 1985 and 1986 were aimed at bringing about the release of hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists, but he claimed that they did not amount to an arms-for-hostages deal `` I've labored under the misapprehension here _ well, worldwide, I guess _ about the so-called Iran-Contra affair,'' he said. `` I've likened it to, if I had a child that was kidnapped, I do n't think that you should pay ransom. But if I found there was another individual that could get that child back for me in return for my doing something for him, that would be all right.'' On superpower relations and arms control, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thinks it is possible that a long-range missile treaty can be negotiated before he leaves office because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might not want to wait for a new administration. While acknowledging that `` none of us really think'' such a strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said he did not think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> necessarily wants to take his time. He said `` we're working as hard as we can, and it's a far more complex treaty than the INF'' -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December. `` But I think that it is possible that we could have that, yes, while this administration is still here.'' The president said he thinks the atmosphere for arms control has improved in recent years, in part because of the nuclear reactor accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. `` Possibly, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it was their tragic experience with <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, and to see that how an area was made unlivable for the people that had lived all their lives there,'' he said. `` And when you stop and think, that that explosion was less than the power of one single warhead.''

 Just a few weeks ago, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seemed to be another hapless dictator teetering on the brink, about to suffer the same fate as <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But not only has the Panamanian strongman survived, he also has been an unsettling presence on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political scene, causing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to break with established policy and producing a degree of interagency turmoil which is unusual even by this administration's contentious standards. At times, administration bureaucrats seem angrier with each other than with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Ideas aired within the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on how to deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have gone from one extreme to the other: Why not kidnap him? How about a trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? Let <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will invade; maybe that will scare him into exile. Since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not inclined to listen to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, perhaps other Latin American governments can talk him into stepping down. Almost nothing has gone right. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after being accused of winking at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug smuggling activities for years, found itself on the defensive when its efforts to remove him came up short. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> even has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turning on the administration these days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that, if elected, he would not `` bargain with drug dealers ... whether they are on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or foreign soil'' _ an implied criticism of government attempts to use dismissal of drug smuggling indictments to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems intent on not allowing the Democrats to outflank him on the drug issue. His comment followed polls showing him trailing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote that reflected strong opposition to lettin indicted drug smugglers off the hook. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are angry with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counterparts who leaked details of the secret negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last week. And <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials accuse the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of coming up with `` harebrained schemes'' for an anti-Noriega plot that included use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces. When White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> outlined a portion of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> negotiating position two weeks ago, department officials exploded, venting their anger not so much at the spokesman but at whoever authorized him to go public. This has not been an easy time for the administration. But Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., says the critics should withhold their fire until they can come up with some workable ideas of their own for dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Almost everyone agrees the administration erred last February in leaving the impression that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would soon leave. As far back as seven weeks ago, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was saying that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was clinging to power `` by his fingernails.'' Yet <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> survives, forcing the administration to make one concession after another in negotiations with him. Initially, the administration was determined to try to force him out without promising not to extradite him once he left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Dismissing the indictments was out of the question. As the weeks passed, the administration retreated steadily, first assuring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> he would not be extradited, then offering to drop the indictments, then, reportedly, offering to let him return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after a post-resignation period in exile. All this has been a blow to the administration's prestige, partially erasing the memory of its 1986 successes in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure. Some, including a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> expert on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, had warned that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could not be toppled so easily. After all, unlike <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was commander of his country's defense forces; as long as they remained loyal, he stayed, even if <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy collapsed, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> correctly argued. But the conventional wisdom in the administration last February was quite different. The combination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure and the strong anti-Noriega sentiment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was certain to topple him, or so it was thought. There was another seemingly favorable portent. What appeared to be the most serious blow against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ the abortive bid by President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to fire him _ occurred on Feb. 25, the second anniversary of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' escape to exile from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. But while <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> languishes in gloomy exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continues to call the shots in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, protected by his U.S.-trained military backers.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took a turn as a candid camera narrator, saying insider books on his presidency compelled a fanciful reply from `` the ultimate insider.'' Attending his last <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> dinner, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had hundreds of photographers, camera crews and an array of news celebrities roaring Thursday night with deadpan captions for a series of pictures projected on three huge screens in a hotel ballroom. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted the recent spate of tell-all books on his administration and told his audience that `` I've had it with all of that. Tonight, I'm going to give it to you from the ultimate insider.'' Standing in one picture alongside Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was explaining to his guest: ` You have to understand, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>, if Domino's does n't get the pizza here in 30 minutes, we get it free.'' In another slide, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was shown standing in the Oval Office and looking on as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leaned over a table to put his signature in a book. `` I even made him write a hundred times, ` I will not cheat. I will not cheat,''' the president told the group gathered in a ballroom of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>. `` I like <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>, but you have to watch him,'' he added. Another slide showed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sitting in a bathrobe in his <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> room with several aides, including then-Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is laughing heartily in the picture, and the president provided this caption: `` So, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, you say you're going to write a book?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he enthusiastically supports Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s run for the White House. Then, showing a picture in which he is stifling a yawn and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has both her hands raised beside her face, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` There we are, listening to one of his speeches.'' In a picture of a meeting with some people in the Oval Office, a young boy was acting up in the foreground. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the youngster must have just `` had a vision of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Oval Office.'' In another slide, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was shown wearing an earphone headset, with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sitting next to him. `` Somebody along the way planted bugs,'' the president explained. Describing another picture in which he was shown peering over sandbags while sitting next to a soldier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the GI asked him, `` Where's the next book coming from?'' On a more serious note, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saluted the photographers, saying `` you've been there with me. You've captured me in moments of hope ... moments of disappointment, and moments of grief. `` You've captured what life has meant for me and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> over the last eight years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Central Bank Governor Resigns; Economic Outlook Grim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has resigned in the face of mounting economic pressures in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, where inflation has soared to 50 percent. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> gave no explanation for his action Thursday. The economist appeared briefly at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, the seat of government, to deliver a letter of resignation to the government of President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>, 50, has disagreed with some of <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>'s solutions for stimulating the economy in this nation of 6.5 million people. `` Unfortunately, I am not a politician and I can not be in these political fights,'' <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> said in a brief interview at the National Palace. By late afternoon, the government had made no comment nor named a replacement. <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> is the second <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> governor to resign since <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> was elected in May 1986. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> quit in November after suggesting that repayments on the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s $ 4 billion debt be limited to 10 percent of export earnings. Last year, debt repayments amounted $ 750 million, or more than the value of total exports. <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> has chafed at <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>'s policy to stimulate the economy by pumping $ 600 million into public works. About 210,000 jobs have been created and economic growth is projected at 8 percent this year, but there have been unwelcome side-effects. Inflation has soared to 50 percent, private economists estimate. The foreign exchange value of the peso has dropped by about 20 percent to 19 cents since late last year. Residents of the capital <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> clashed in February with police during demonstrations to protest increases in the cost of living and the scarcity of basic goods like milk and cement. Public employees demanded and received an increase in the minimum wage.

<HEAD>College Endowments Suffer As Result Of Market Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A college business group says 50 of the wealthiest American universities lost 13.1 percent of their endowments in the last quarter of 1987 as a result of the stock market crash. By comparison, common stocks overall dropped 22.6 percent during the final three months of 1987, as measured by the Standard and Poor's 500, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The group, which has tracked endowments since 1974, said the downturn came after an excellent year for the campus funds, including a gain of nearly 25 percent in the stock market during the 12 months that ended on June 30, 1987. The typical campus had little more than half its endowment invested in stocks. The overall return on their holdings in the 1986-87 academic year was 13.9 percent, the business officers said. In arriving at the 13.9 percent figure, the association used data supplied by 296 colleges and universities with endowments ranging from $ 1.5 million for <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> to $ 4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. The market value of the endowments of all 296 institutions was $ 47.9 billion at mid-year. The report did not provide a cumulative figure for after the crash. There are more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The association study covers most of those with endowments of $ 1 million or more. While the group normally reports trends from July of one year through June of the next, it commissioned a special analysis by <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> on the impact of the Oct. 19 stock market crash, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average of 30 industrial stocks fell 508 points. `` The October 1987 stock market tumble caused 50 college and university endowments of $ 100 million or more to fall an average of 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of the calendar year,'' said the study, reported in the May issue of Business Officer, an association magazine. After `` the market meltdown,'' those 50 universities engaged in a `` modest repositioning,'' it said. The 50 were not named, and no figures were given on where their endowments stood after the tumble. Between Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, their asset allocations went from 63 percent to 57 percent stocks, from 27 percent to 32 percent bonds and from 10 percent to 11 percent cash. At mid-year, among all 296 colleges and universities, the average investment pool was composed of 54.2 percent stocks, 29.4 percent bonds, 12.7 percent cash and equivalents, 1.9 percent real estate and 1.8 percent other assets. Ten endowments were worth $ 1 billion or more last summer. They were: <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.02 billion; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> system, $ 2.8 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.3 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.1 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.7 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.4 billion; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system, $ 1.21 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.2 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.17 billion; and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.12 billion.

<HEAD>Lamb Consumption Rises, But Only Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sheep producers have fared better the last year or so, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says lamb chops are still a long way from being at the top of the menu. Lamb consumption may edge up in 1988 after declining over the last 20 years. But do n't trade for a sheep ranch just yet. `` In the first place, the slight increase in prospective consumption, from 1.3 pounds per capita to 1.4, does not mean that -LRB- producers -RRB- can look forward to any sustained recovery in consumer demand,'' the report said. By comparison, 1988 per capita consumption of beef is expected to be 72.1 pounds, retail weight; pork, 62.7 pounds; and veal, 1.5 pounds. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast for poultry consumption this year is 82.9 pounds per capita. The report, largely the work of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, was prepared for the June issue of Farmline magazine, which is published each month by the agency. `` While retailers will find buyers for the additional quantities, selling prices are likely to fall, reducing incentives for a major rebuilding of the nation's sheep herd,'' the report said. `` The buying habits of consumers and the abundance of other red meats and poultry will probably exert some downward pressure on prices, and so keep lamb production and consumption from rising substantially.'' Lamb is a staple in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> but has never been one of the more popular meats for Americans. `` Eating habits are established early in life, and those who do n't grow up eating lamb are less likely to develop a taste for it later,'' the report said. Americans each consumed an average of 4.2 pounds of lamb in 1960, but the per capita rate has declined by two-thirds, reflecting the downward thrust of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep industry. At the turn of the century, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep herd was around 48 million head. Now, it's fewer than 11 million. Even so, the department's Jan. 1 inventory report showed 4 percent gain from a year earlier, a response to the improved prices of recent years. <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> said that with production catching up, lamb market prices are unlikely to rebound to the peaks of 1986 or last year's average of $ 78 per 100 pounds Continued high production levels and supplies of other red meats and poultry will also dampen gains in the lamb market. The average price of lamb may be in the range of $ 74 and $ 77 per hundredweight this year. Although lower, that would still be high enough to ensure producers a healthy return, he said. In 1987, for example, with lambs averaging $ 78 per hundredweight, producers made about $ 42 per ewe, according to agency estimates, <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> said. One of the problems for producers is a scarcity of plants that slaughter and process lambs. Most facilities that kill more than 100,000 lambs a year are in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and West. While a high percentage of the nation's sheep are in those areas, producers in other regions must absorb transportation costs when their lambs go to slaughter. Two years ago, a large poultry firm which also processes lamb opened a plant in <LOCATION> Harrisonburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in an attempt to fill the needs of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> restaurant trade. `` But the firm stopped slaughtering last year because farms in the region could not provide enough lambs, and animals had to be shipped in from the West,'' <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> said. Predators, including coyotes and wild or roaming dogs, also have helped keep down lamb production in many areas, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says farmers have signed up to take 54.2 million acres of cropland from production in 1988, down 10 percent from 59.9 million acres idled in 1987. Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1988 idled acreage would represent an area larger than the state of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. To be eligible for federal price supports and related benefits, farmers are required to take a percentage of their base from crop production and put the land into conservation uses that help protect the soil. The idled or `` diverted'' acres signed up for in 1988 under the commodity programs included: corn, 20.9 million acres, down from 23 million acres last year; sorghum, 4.1 million, up from 4 million; barley, 2.9 million, unchanged; oats, 300,000, down from 800,000; and total feed grains, 28.2 million acres, down from 30.7 million in 1987. Wheat farmers signed up to idle 22.8 million acres this year, down from 23.8 million in 1987; cotton, 2.1 million acres, down from 3.8 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres, down from 1.6 million. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday that farmers enrolled 187.8 million acres of feed grain, wheat, cotton, and rice in the 1988 acreage program, which represented 83.4 percent of the 225.2 million base acres in the program crops. Last year's enrollment made up 86.5 percent of the 1987 base of 226.4 million acres.

<HEAD>Shoppers Concern Over Nutrition Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More women than men say they are very concerned about eating the right foods, and old people are more concerned than any other age group, a survey on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> shoppers reports. The annual survey of shoppers by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit association representing the food industry, found `` dynamic increases'' in customer awareness of health issues such as fat, salt and sugar content. In the survey in January of 1,019 shoppers, 58 percent of the women said they were very concerned about nutrition, compared with 48 percent of men. Some 59 percent of people without children said they were very concerned about nutrition, compared with 52 percent of those who had children at home. The share who said they were very concerned about nutrition was largest among senior citizens, at 72 percent of people aged 65 and over. Those aged 18 to 24 showed the least interest, 33 percent being very concerned. The share very concerned about nutrition peaked in the South at 60 percent, followed by 56 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, 54 percent in the East and 52 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` People are remarkably knowledgeable and sophisticated about health and nutrition issues,'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. They are adjusting their diets, doing less frying and more broiling of foods, seeking more fresh fruits, he said. Some 27 percent of supermarket shoppers said they are concerned about fat in their foods, up from 16 percent just a year ago and 9 percent in 1983, the institute said. And worry about cholesterol jumped eight points from 14 percent to 22 percent in the past year, the institute said. It rated 5 percent in 1983. `` I think the important thing is that the numbers are increasing. ... It shows more and more people are learning that fatty foods can contribute to heart disease, obesity and possibly colon and breast cancer,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON>, nutrition director for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer-oriented health advocacy group. `` More and more people have gotten the message that they should cut back on fat, but ... people need help translating principles into breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' she said. <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> urged food manufacturers to provide clearer labeling, with guidance such as `` high, low or medium'' fat, in addition to the actual measurement. However, consumer concern does n't necessarily translate into action. Just last week Prevention magazine's annual health study disclosed that 54 percent of people polled said they were trying to reduce the fat in their diets, a decline from 56 percent a year earlier. Even so, <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> stressed that the food industry is responding to consumer concerns. In recent years farmers have begun raising leaner hogs than in the past, markets are trimming more of the fat from meats and offering leaner meat cuts, and the government has changed grading standards to make leaner meats more attractive, he pointed out. Indeed, a coalition of more than a dozen consumer health groups is expected to release a study shortly praising major food manufacturers and restaurant chains for reducing their use of saturated fats. While more than one-quarter of shoppers expressed concern about fat, the institute found that as many as half said they turned to labels for information on these and other ingredients. Some 46 percent of shoppers said they looked on food labels for fat and protein content of foods. Other topics gaining attention of consumers included `` freshness and purity,'' up 7 points from last year to 15 percent saying they are concerned. Salt and sugar each gained 4 percentage points, to 26 percent and 20 percent respectively. Worry about preservatives was up 2 points to 16 percent and chemical additives rose 1 point to 14 percent. Concern about vitamin content was unchanged at 21 percent, as was the 14 percent rating for calories. The findings were reported in the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 edition of `` Trends: Consumer Attitudes & amp; The Supermarket.'' The margin of error for the sample generally ranges between 2 and 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary May Be Helping Bush With Economic Engineering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is looking to a powerful ally on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for help in seeing that his most valuable campaign asset, the current 65-month economic recovery, will last at least until Election Day. The ally is not President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but a political supporter who occupies the building next door, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. And some economists contend <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> may be giving the vice president more than just advice. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials wo n't comment on the speculation, but some economists point to recent activity in international markets as evidence that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been leaning hard on major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners to help elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans. These actions include recent intervention in currency markets by other central banks and heavy foreign purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury securities, particularly by Japanese investors _ measures that can help stabilize the shaky dollar, minimize inflation and help keep the economy on an even keel. A leading proponent of such a view is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He cites the spending of huge sums by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries to stabilize the dollar, at prices higher than investors are willing to pay, as a form of `` political insurance'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Foreign allies `` do n't want to see a big discontinuity in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policies. It's not so much that they're against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They just want stability in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an election year,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Two years ago, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wanted a lower dollar. Now <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants a strong dollar, at least until the election. Because <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is fearful that a dollar decline could lead to another stock market crash,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. Although a weak dollar can help ease the trade deficit by making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive, it can also reignite inflation and drive foreign investors away from <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities and other dollar-based investments, threatening the financing of the government's huge budget deficit. Foreign-exchange reserves held by the world's central banks last year grew to $ 790 billion from $ 559 billion, and <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> estimates that two-thirds of this increase comes from efforts by central banks to support the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has earmarked another $ 60 billion to spend this year to help prop up the dollar against the yen, after expanding its foreign-exchange holdings by $ 40 billion in 1987. At the same time, foreign investors have become the single largest buyer of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities. This helps underwrite the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit, since selling <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and bills is the government's primary way of financing its red ink spending. Analysts estimate that Japanese investors alone bought as much as half of last week's sale of $ 8.5 billion in new 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Analysts have speculated that the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> persuaded them to do so, perhaps as a favor to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. If Japanese and other foreign investors were to withdraw their stake in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, interest rates would be forced up sharply, possibly triggering a recession. An economic downturn at this point could spell disaster for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential efforts. And while most economists do n't see a recession likely in the months ahead, many forecasters are expressing new fears about an escalation in both inflation and interest rates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been wielding the recovery _ a peacetime record _ as a major campaign weapon. While he scoffed at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies as `` voodoo economics'' in 1980, he now regularly extols them on campaign stops as the `` American miracle.'' The similarity in phrasing to the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' trumpeted by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no coincidence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists claim the vice president will launch a major assault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim after the party conventions this summer, seeking to demonstrate that the job-creation claimed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor is merely an outgrowth of Reagan-Bush economic policies. However, for the strategy to work, the economy must continue to perform vigorously in the months to come. Last week's report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank by $ 4 billion between February and March provided some needed market-driven stimulus to the ailing dollar. However stock and bond markets slumped as investors worried that rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports without an accompanying reduction in imports could fan inflation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is an early <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter and is expected at some point to assume a key role in managing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s general election campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Thursday, `` For now I'm staying at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lieutenants have suggested that, at least for the time being, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> may be more useful to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there. `` It may be more prudent to seek his advice as a Cabinet member'' rather than bringing him into the campaign, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff chief <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to comment on allegations that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was using his influence to try to persuade Japanese, West German and other governments to take steps that would promote an economic environment conducive to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory. But one official, who demanded anonymity, said that trying to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> out of a recession does not exactly run contrary to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s role as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary _ regardless of which candidate it might help.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Not All Hill Testimony Was Protected By Immunity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Key admissions to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> about the Iran-Contra affair could be used against them in court despite immunity grants, prosecutors say. The prosecutors contend that hundreds of statements by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> during last year's hearings are not covered by the limited grants of immunity they received from the congressional Iran-Contra committees. These statements include <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s admission that he approved <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s idea to help finance the Nicaraguan rebels with profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales and did n't tell President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in order to give him `` some future deniability'' if the operation were exposed. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended in a court filing Thursday that he could also use statements by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> that they destroyed documents during the November 1986 investigation that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> conducted after the arms-for-hostage deals became public. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made the legal claim in a filing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the issue of whether his investigation was tainted by exposure of prosecutors and grand jurors to the immunized testimony of the three defendants. The three are accused of conspiring with retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to defraud the government by diverting arms-sale profits to the Contras and obstructing inquiries by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the operation. The indictment includes charges that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> made false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying their involvement in the private network supplying the Contras and destroyed evidence during <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s probe. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s business partner, testified on Capitol Hill without an immunity grant. The so-called `` use immunity'' bars <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using an individual defendant's compelled congressional testimony as evidence against that person. But in a brief filed by special counsel <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, the independent counsel contended that many answers by the three defendants fell outside the immunity grant because they were volunteered. `` Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congresional testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial against them,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who was retained to handle the immunity issues. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> offered to `` forgo the use of congressional testimony'' as direct evidence against the defendants if the court would dispose of the immunity issue. But the prosecution cited hundreds of examples of congressional testimony it contends could be used as evidence against the defendants. `` The transcripts reveal that the defendants intended to answer questions that were not asked, to volunteer information that they wished to disclose, and to go beyond any fair reading of many of the questions that were asked,'' the brief said. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions `` clearly demonstrate that defendants may not turn an immunity grant into a license to volunteer information to bar prosecution,'' the independent counsel said. The defense, in a separate filing, called the claim `` simply absurd.'' `` Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and never relinquished it,'' lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> said in a joint filing. `` The court should flatly reject the IC's -LRB- independent counsel's -RRB- attempt to circumvent the immunity statute. Defense lawyers also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment on the ground that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> took insufficient steps to isolate his staff from the defendants' immunized testimony, which `` has seeped into every corner of this case.'' But the independent counsel defended his procedures, arguing that the defense had failed to show that the investigation had illegally relied on immunized testimony. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to set a trial date, arguing that the defense request for further proceedings on the immunity issue amounted to `` a transparent attempt at delay.''

<HEAD>Impeachment Panel Seeks Testimony From Convicted Hastings Friend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment panel is seeking crucial testimony from a closemouthed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who was convicted in 1982 of arranging a bribe for federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> racketeers. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders, a prominent criminal lawyer, was among the witnesses summoned to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice when it resumes impeachment proceedings against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> next week. But there was no assurance that Borders will break his silence on the case. Borders previously has refused to testify against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, his close friend, and never testified at his or <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' trials The subcommittee, which will meet again on Tuesday, is eager to ask Borders the critical question of whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was ever aware that his friend was arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for him. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with Borders to solicit the bribe from the two convicted racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. The subcommittee is investigating charges by a special five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> actually took part in the bribery scheme and tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his trial. When <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested Borders in his car outside a suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, hotel in October 1981 _ hours before an evening boating party to have been held by fellow lawyers in Borders' honor _ they found a garment bag stuffed with $ 125,000 in cash on the front seat. The money had just been delivered to Borders as the final bribe payment by an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who sat in the car posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. Another <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> friend, <PERSON> Hemphill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pride </PERSON>, testified Thursday that when he told the judge of Borders' arrest later that day, `` he was shocked, he looked like his mouth went dry, he could n't believe it happened.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> then hurriedly left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The judicial investigative panel concluded that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> fled `` because he knew he was criminally involved with Borders in the Romano bribery scheme.'' His fellow judges, in a 381-page report on the affair, said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> boarded a flight from an airport near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` because he wanted to avoid being interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' The results of the 3 -LCB- - year judicial investigation were outlined by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general and special counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during the Watergate impeachment proceedings against President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1974 <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said the appellate panel had uncovered evidence not available to the trial jury that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had given false testimony about a series of telephone calls and had drafted phony letters intended to obscure his alleged involvement in the bribery conspiracy. Under questioning by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigators, <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said he had found no evidence of any racial motivation behind <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' prosecution or the subsequent inquiry by the judicial panel. If the subcommittee recommends impeachment, and the full <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> concurs, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must vote whether to impeach <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would conduct a trial. A two-thirds majority vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required for conviction and removal from office.

<HEAD>Group Says 175 Parks Threatened by Development</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new coalition of preservationists says national parks across the country face threats from commercial development similar to a plan by a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company to build a shopping mall next to the <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION>. `` At 175 parks, the threat is so significant that the reason the park was established may be lost,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, one of the founders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said other endangered parks include <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; and Olympic National Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At a press conference, <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> and other opponents of the Manassas shopping mall announced their intention to stop it and any other project that endangers a historic site. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s former press secretary, <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, is helping the group free of charge with public relations and organized the gathering. The coalition _ sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ is calling for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact legislation giving the federal government power to halt development temporarily so that negotiation, compromise or federal acquisition of disputed property can take place. As part of its project to protect the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> battlefield, the coalition is working for passage of a bill recently introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that directs the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary to acquire the land now owned by developers. Meanwhile, bulldozing is under way to prepare for townhouses and detached homes that will accompany the shopping mall. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, spokesman for the developer, <ORGANIZATION> Hazel-Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said nothing can stop construction short of an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The acreage in question includes the site where Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> directed troops for the second battle of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> and includes land used for hospital space and as a burial ground for some of the war dead. Though the land has been part of a master plan for expanding the 4,500-acre park since 1935, it never was acquired by the federal government and <PERSON> Hazel-Peterson </PERSON> bought it about three years ago for $ 10 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is promoting a compromise in which the developer would move the mall so it is not visible from the park. The plan is acceptable to Hazel-Peterson, but not the preservationists who say even the mall still will generate so much traffic that visitors wo n't be able to get to the park without massive traffic jams. Fifteen organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Local History, the Council on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Military Past, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historians </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, are included in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>US Funds Monitoring Commission, Blasts Sandinistas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has approved $ 10 million to monitor compliance with the Nicaraguan peace process, drawing congressional criticism for taking so long to decide how to use the money. The money was part of a $ 48 million package approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in late March, a week after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and the Contra rebels signed a temporary truce at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That agreement called for the creation of a verification commission to monitor compliance with the accord. Of the funds, $ 8 million will go for activities of <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 2 million for Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, leader of the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The allocations are based on a budget submitted by the commission to which the two men belong. Shortly after the grant was announced, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, criticized the administration for taking six weeks to determine how to spend the funds. Other Democrats have made the same criticism. Money for the verification commission had been held up because the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> were unable to agree on a proposal that met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goverment accounting requirements. This drew an angry reaction from Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were demanding an elaborate accounting system from the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> on the one hand while, on the other, they were giving money to the Contras and letting it `` simply disappear into the jungle. In announcing the grant, the administration launched a harsh attack on the Sandinista government. The administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, charged that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had engaged in a campaign of `` harassment and intimidation'' and `` menacing militarism'' in apparent violation of agreements signed by Sandinista authorities. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said in letters to <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> and <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo: `` Anyone who shares our interest in peace, democracy and reconciliation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> must be greatly alarmed by the recent crackdown on human rights and civil liberties by the Sandinista government.'' `` This barrage of harassment and intimidation makes it clear that the verification commission must fully monitor the very fundamental issues of democracy, civil liberties and human rights.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> told the commission members that a series of incidents in recent weeks has undermined `` the process of reconciliation to which the Nicaraguan government committed itself.'' He said the process is being further scuttled by the Nicaraguan government's `` menacing militarism.'' He cited a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in which he threatened the Contras with `` actions on a scale never before seen in this war.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> also said Nicaraguan authorities have placed severe limitations on press freedom and that more than 30 persons supporting construction workers conducting a hunger strike were arrested. The Sandinistas and the Contras are attempting to negotiate a permanent settlement but have made little progress. The deadline for reaching an agreement is June 1.

<HEAD>Baker Rules Out Sweeping Changes In World Monetary System</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release at 2:30 a.m. EDT, TIME set by source.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With PM-World Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The global economy is changing too rapidly for governments to successfully impose major changes in the way they manage exchange rates, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he favors gradual, step-by-step efforts to improve coordination of monetary policy among the major industrialized countries. He cited as an example a possible broadening of coordination on national tax reform and deregulation of financial and labor markets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also could work more closely with its major trading partners in monitoring the performance of their economies, he said. But in remarks prepared for delivery to the Council on Foreign Relations, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ruled out any `` sweeping, revolutionary changes in the system.'' His appearance before the council was closed to the news media. Copies of his speech were made available in advance. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met on Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with trade and finance ministers from the 24 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` An attempt to make an abrupt or major change in the structure of the system by imposing a detailed set of formal constraints might well be viewed by the markets as overly ambitious and unsustainable,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The global economy is too dynamic, and the forces of change too strong, to be able to look ahead with great certainty and envision a highly defined international monetary structure that will fit the world economy of 1995 as well as that of 2005,'' he added. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> meeting Thursday that the seven largest industrial countries were pleased with the relative stability of exchange rates since last December, when they jointly bought massive amounts of dollars in the open market in order to halt its steep decline. `` We see no reason to believe that that wo n't continue,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In his speech to the foreign relations group, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the major economic powers' efforts since 1985 to improve monetary coordination had been a remarkable, although incomplete, success. `` I strongly suspect the world economy is better off today than we would have been had we not followed this course,'' he said. Some government officials and private experts have said the world monetary system should undergo more radical reforms than suggested by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A study published earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said existing international agreements on ways of keeping exchange rates stable were `` agonizingly fragile.'' The issue of reforms to the world monetary system is expected to be discussed at a June 19-21 summit meeting in Tornoto of leaders from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Committee Clears Bill To Strengthen Disclosure Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House is expected to act quickly on legislation requiring lenders to make full disclosure of what one of the sponsors calls `` the potential pitfalls'' of home equity loans. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a major sponsor of the bill, said he expected it to become law rapidly after clearing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday by a unanimous voice vote. He noted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already approved a similar, but less stringent, measure. `` Home equity loans can be like a loaded pistol,'' said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. `` Consumers need to beware or they can blow up in their face.'' The legislation requires lenders to make full disclosure on home equity loan accounts so that new applicants can know exactly what it is they are applying for. Lenders would have to provide information on the annual interest percentage rate, any fees associated with the loan, a series of warnings about the risks involved and a description of repayment options. `` With the passage of the ... bill, the committee is taking the mystery out of the home equity loans and hopefully providing consumers with a guide to the potential pitfalls of home equity loans,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking consumer affairs subcommittee which handled the bill, echoed the sentiments of <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and other proponents of the legislation `` This legislation enables consumers to know that home equity loans have risks as well as benefits,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said. `` This legislation will assure that they receive, at the time of application, all the information necessary to make an informed decision, whether to apply for such a loan. `` In addition, it will strictly limit areas which were susceptible to abuse by the unilateral action of creditors.'' The bill also provides for other consumer protections: - A prohibition on a creditor unilaterally changing the terms of the loan contract - Requiring the use of publicly available indexes outside the control of the lender when the rate of interest varies - Restrictions on the lender from calling in the loan before the term of the loan - A right to obtain a refund of application fees if the lender changes the terms after an application is submitted but before the account is opened The committee's action was lauded by consumer organizations, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the `` disclosure and advertising provisions are impractical. They will result in an unnecessary overload of information for consumers, and they will severely limit the creditors' ability to design informative advertisements.'' Home equity loans - a line of credit available to borrowers who provide their homes as collateral - have grown more popular in recent years, especially since interest on them is tax deductible in most cases. Consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between 1986 and 1987 from $ 40 billion to $ 80 billion.

<HEAD>Teamsters Accept Contract Although Truckers Voted Against It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union accepted a new trucking industry contract that was overwhelmingly rejected in rank-and-file balloting, with a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> official saying members who did n't vote probably favored it. The union said Thursday that 64,101 truckers voted to turn down the proposed three-year National Master Freight Agreement while 36,782 supported the new proposal. The 63.5 percent opposition vote fell short of the two-thirds voting majority needed under Teamster bylaws to reject a contract and authorize a strike. Under the union's constitution, 66.66 percent of those voting have to turn down a proposed contract or it goes into effect automatically. `` Since the constitution requires that the final offer be accepted as a result of failure to reject by two-thirds vote, any strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and have serious consequences,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON>, chairman of the union negotiating committee, said in a statement. <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said over 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not returned. He maintained that it was likely the 80,000 members who did not return ballots were satisfied with the final offer. `` If not, they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract,'' he said. The new contract provides annual 35-cents-an-hour wage gains over the next three years to some 200,000 workers. The contract raises the base rate for truck drivers from the current $ 14.71 an hour to $ 15.06 an hour retroactive to April 1. This would be followed by similar 35-cent hourly raises in 1989 and 1990. The contract proved unpopular with union truck drivers because of certain changes in work rules. Locals were upset over a provision of the agreement that would require all Teamsters members at a trucking company that is losing money to give back 15 percent of their pay in exchange for a promised share of any future profits if 75 percent of the union members vote to do so. Another provision could force drivers to pay for loss of freight or for truck damage if their company proves gross negligence.

<HEAD>Studies Show Benefits Of Additional Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women with early stage breast cancer would benefit from treatment in addition to initial surgery or radiation therapy, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says, citing three studies that have yet to be published. Such additional treatment _ chemotherapy or hormonal therapy or both _ has been the institution's formal recommendation for the past two years in cases involving more advanced breast cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> announcement Thursday shows the institute views the new findings significant enough to publicize before they are formally published in a medical journal or presented at a scientific meeting. Women with early stage breast cancer _ before it has spread to lymph nodes under the arm _ have been regarded as having a relatively favorable prognosis after primary treatment, but it is now recognized that up to 30 percent have recurrences of their cancer, the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The richness of the clinical evidence from a variety of trials now shows that this outlook can be improved upon,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> Director Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. The data that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION>'s statement were presented to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on May 9 and a special clinical alert was mailed Monday to 13,000 cancer specialists and cancer organizations. `` Each year more than 60,000 women in this country are diagnosed with node-negative breast cancer ... and we can not delay informing them and their physicians that additional treatment beyond surgery and-or radiotherapy may be beneficial,'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> researcher, said future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> studies will focus on which forms of additional treatment are best, rather than whether there is a benefit from any such treatment. It is estimated that 135,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women will get breast cancer this year and that 42,000 will die from it. One in 10 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. `` The emerging information from the three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> studies is consistent with a more mature body of information from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> investigators,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> announcement said. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> study of 679 patients found 80 percent of those given additional treatment were cancer-free after four years compared with 71 percent who were not given additional treatment. The other study involved 2,644 patients in which 82 percent of those given additional treatment were cancer-free after four years compared with 77 percent of those receiving a placebo. The third involved about 350 patients and found 84 percent of those given additional treatment cancer-free after three years compared with 67 percent of those given a placebo.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $14.3 Billion Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House has been given a $ 14.3 billion foreign aid bill that represents a 2 percent increase over last year's level and largely continues current programs. On a voice vote Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved without amendment the bill passed earlier this month by its foreign operations subcommittee. The bill covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. There was little debate on the measure because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has little flexibility in dealing with appropriations as a result of budget-cutting agreements reached late last year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> again would receive more than any other country under the bill _ some $ 1.8 billion in military aid and $ 1.2 billion in economic assistance. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which is favored for making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, receives the second-largest amount _ $ 1.3 billion in military assistance and $ 815 million in economic aid. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has been regarded as a front-line country because of the Soviet occupation of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, would receive $ 220 million in economic aid and $ 240 million in forgiven loans for purchase of military goods. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would receive $ 124 million in economic aid and $ 125 million in military aid. Some $ 90 million in economic support and $ 655 million in economic development money would be used for African countries. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would get $ 85 million in economic aid, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> $ 90 million, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> $ 185 million and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> $ 80 million. Military aid for those and other countries was not earmarked, but would come out of separate military aid and credit accounts. The bill also would give economic aid of $ 40 million to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>; $ 20 million to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>; $ 10 million to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>; $ 15 million to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>; between $ 10 million and $ 35 million for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>; and $ 2 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity trade union. Some $ 34 million would be set aside for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> development projects, of which $ 11 million is for projects in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and $ 23 million for those in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The bill would allocate $ 150 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, $ 101 million for international narcotics control, $ 362 million for migration and refugee assistance, $ 35 million for the prevention of AIDS worldwide and $ 254 million to pay past-due debts of international financial institutions. It would send $ 217 million to support a long list of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> organizations, and stipulate that the money for <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> must be obligated within 30 days of passage of the bill, or the administration would suffer an automatic cut of $ 50 million in money for military aid. It is up to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to decide how to divide up the balance of funds for nations not specifically mentioned in the bill. About 100 countries receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid directly.

<HEAD>Pope's Trip Created Public Forum For Conflicts In Latin America</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> created a public forum for debate during his latest Latin American tour, shedding light on political conflict, poverty and drug trafficking. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> was the last and most sensitive stop on the pontiff's 12-day visit, with local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> members criticizing the 34-year authoritarian rule of President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> During his four-nation visit, the pope shared the stage with an impoverished Bolivian miner, heard pleas by <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s president to help end terrorism and attended a gathering in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> that turned into a political protest rally. The tour that began in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> May 7 and ended with his return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Thursday was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s ninth to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since becoming pope in 1978. When the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> met at the ornate 19th century presidential palace, an announcer on the state-run television broke in to alert viewers that the leader of their country was about to speak. Paraguayans say an emotionless <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> often looked down at his hands during the encounter. They also heard the pontiff preach to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> on human rights and political freedoms. It was more remarkable the following day when the TV carried a speech by actress <PERSON> Heddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Frutos </PERSON> denouncing political repression during a meeting with the pontiff that the government initially had canceled. `` The society in which we live is marked by a profound sense of death and violence which are an affront to the rights and dignity of the children of God,'' she told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. An hour later, during a stop in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s Chaco region, it was the turn of an Indian leader to denounce whites for stealing their land. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> heard other messages as he journeyed high in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and nearly to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A miner in <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, describing the plight of workers hit hard by the government's austerity program, told the pope in emotional tones that they were out of work and hungry. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, his democratically elected government battling a deep economic crisis and a guerrilla insurgency, denounced the interest rates his country is charged on loans from foreign banks and appealed to the pope to do what he could to halt the terrorist violence. For his part, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered some fresh if general prescriptions for a region he called `` the continent of hope'' and which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> estimates will contain half the world's 900 million Catholics by the turn of the century. There now are about 860 million Catholics worldwide. Living a Christian life `` does not mean simply accepting with resignation the difficulties that you encounter.'' But he emphasized that Latin Americans must help themselves, work hard and not expect outside aid will solve all their problems. He told an audience in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, a major cocaine-producer, that they needed to wage an `` urgent'' battle against drug-trafficking because corruption was destroying their society. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> heard <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> call his government democratic and extol its law-and-order policies for keeping <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> free of terrorism, hunger and drugs. But the following day the pope drew long applause for declaring that the broad participation of the public was a requisite for democracy. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the longest-ruling head of state in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, has been criticized for failing to allow a genuine political opposition. The pope endorsed the efforts of his local bishops to develop a `` pluralistic society.''

<HEAD>Private Report Suggests $2.5 Billion For Philippine Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators should agree to seek $ 2.5 billion over five years to keep military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on the condition that President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> move to allow the bases beyond 1991, says a report today from a conservative think tank. The report by <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> policy analyst <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> also advocates the sale of modern jet fighters and naval warships to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military and a review of `` the entire range of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions to keep <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> from expelling <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. forces.'' A review of the bases agreement which lapses in 1991 is under way in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, with compensation for the bases a major issue. Neither side in the talks has indicated how much might be asked for or paid. But suggestions by Philippine officials have ranged to more than $ 1 billion a year over the current $ 180 million annual aid attached to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Naval Base during the expiring five-year period. Actual military aid to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during the five years will total about $ 1.7 billion, says <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> in his report, `` A Strategy for Keeping the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is a privately funded think tank which generally espouses conservative views, often paralleling those of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Aid tied to the bases is one of three major financial packages being considered for the financially troubled <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> which is more than $ 28 billion in debt. The administration, according to sources, is preparing to back a multinational effort to collect $ 10 billion over five years in aid, trade concessions and debt relief. It has also asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appropriate $ 257 million in aid for fiscal 1989, down $ 90 million from what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have suggested all the aid might be tied together, but Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she supports the multinational aid idea only if it is not linked to what the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> views as rent for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, in his analysis, calls the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> the `` <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' saying that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abandons them, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will move in. `` Were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to withdraw from the bases, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> surely would be emboldened to give direct assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> CPP </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, he said. Philippine officials estimate that up to 25,000 communist rebels are fighting the government, and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says the communists now control 20 percent of the countryside. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> criticizes <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exile during eight years of martial law under ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The report describes <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> as `` a staunch nationalist apparently obsessed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial past.'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has said the bases do not protect the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ca n't increase the rent, it should get out. The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> analyst also scores Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> for not taking a stand on the bases. She has said only that she is keeping her options open until the current agreement is renegotiated, sometime before 1991. `` Her vagueness tends to strengthen the hand'' of <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, the report says. A pro-bases view is being expressed by <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today after five days of meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, according to Filipino sources close to the former chief military commander, assured <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that he believes the bases aid both Philippine and regional security. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s view will be crucial if the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decides to hold a referendum on the future of the bases. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> notes that while the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> constitution proclaims `` a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons in its territory,'' it also contains a loophole which might allow them because it says the policy must be `` consistent with the national interest.'' Philippine officials traveling with <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> say a bill to eliminate the loophole has strong support in the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but has less chance in what they describe as the more pro-American House of Representatives.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hardly Mentions Jackson As Both Campaign In California</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, making only passing references to the upcoming Democratic presidential primary in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was placing his emphasis squarely on the fall campaign against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Democratic front-runner, who expects to lock up his party's presidential nomination with another windfall of delegates in the closing primaries on June 7, scheduled appearances today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> He flew into the state Thursday and told a rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that in the fall election voters would have a choice `` between two fundamentally different sets of values. Between two different sets of beliefs about how we build a strong economy; about how we build the best America.'' Despite heckling by protesters claiming he was not doing or saying enough about AIDS, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew repeated cheers from the crowd as he delivered a speech that belied his reputation as a dull speaker. Hecklers in the auditorium of the Musicians' Hall on the west side of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> held up signs saying, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> + Dukakis More AIDS Deaths.'' `` We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,'' hecklers shouted. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came to a section of his speech in which he referred to changing research priorities from the military to health care, he referred to acquired immune deficiency syndrome as `` a disease that must be conquered'' and said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was spending `` more per case for AIDS than any other state in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Homosexuals in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> accused the governor of discriminating against them when he supported giving heterosexual couples preference in adopting foster children. The only references <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made to his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were tributes to the fact the Democratic race had come down to choice between the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants and a black man born in poverty in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. He hardly mentioned the June 7 primary, instead referring several times to the importance of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the fall election. `` The election this fall will be the most important and closest since 1960,'' he said. `` And it may well be decided right here in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' He sounded his familiar themes of the need to attract more people to teaching, of the need for a broader health care system, for child care, and for a war on drugs. One of the loudest cheers came when he said, `` On January 20, 1989, we're going to have an attorney general _ no matter who she or he is _ that will put the word `` justice'' back in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>.''

 A quotation that former press secretary <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> fabricated closely resembles something President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalls telling Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' confession of fabricated quotes drew harsh condemnations from the White House when his book, `` Speaking Out,'' was released early last month. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told foreign broadcasters Thursday that `` actually, I have to say he was not too far wrong with some of the things that were said at our -LRB- his and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s -RRB- earlier summit meetings.'' In his book, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said that during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985, he manufactured a quote in the president's name. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> privately that `` there is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, when asked to assess the impact of the <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' revelations on the president's dealings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, recalled the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting that led to one of the fabricated quotes: `` I remember that the general secretary and I, together in a room one-on-one, remarked about the uniqueness of our situation, and that very possibly, between us, war and peace for the world could be decided depending on what we did. And I remember also saying to him that I did n't think that we distrusted each other because of our armaments, that we armed because we distrusted each other.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> convention in mid-April that he had not been aware of the statements <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> concocted. During his April 13 appearance before the newspaper editors here, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` I can tell you right now that I have no affection for these kiss-and-tell books that are being written and I find it entirely fiction.'' After referring to a previous address he had delivered, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` That's one of the nice things about his job. You get to quote yourself shamelessly, and if you do n't, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> will.''

 Presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will not pay its foreign debt if the burden of its loan obligations keeps the country's economy from growing. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> also pledged to open <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to foreign investment, loosen state restrictions on the economy and guide the nation into the battle for international markets. The nominee of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the man virtually certain to succeed President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> chose this conservative industrial city to outline his economic policy. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, as the governing party is known by its Spanish initials, has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial election since it was founded in 1929. In a speech Thursday night, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told businessmen in this northeastern city near his family home that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s limping economy will grow again He promised a policy of cooperation with foreign creditors instead of `` irresponsible formulas of confrontation.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is about $ 100 billion, the second highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been meeting payments on its foreign loans and has built up a record amount of foreign reserves. It has negotiated with its creditors for easier terms on the foreign debt and is seeking more ways to ease the payment burden. But economic growth will have priority over payments on the foreign debt, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said. `` If we fail to grow because of the burden of the debt, we will not pay,'' he added. The candidate was cheered as he spoke of curtailing government controls, reducing budget deficits and letting private business invest in such areas as telecommunications, petrochemicals and other fields that have been reserved for state investments. Previous administations have favored a more centralized economy and tight economic controls. `` We will consolidate the opening of our markets and we will promote foreign investment,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told the gathering. `` The opening of our economy to the foreign competition is an irreversible fact,'' he said. `` Foreign investments must play a more positive role contributing to the creation of jobs, to technological modernization and the opening of foreign markets.'' He stressed the need to eliminate subsidies and exercise `` financial discipline'' to make economic growth possible. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said the time was past in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when the state was `` the only instrument for the solution of each and every problem of the economy and society. `` In this new strategy to develop exports, you will have to take chances,'' he told the businessmen. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy has been seriously affected in the past six years by rocketing inflation that reached a record 159.2 percent in 1987. The government this year has managed to reduce the inflation rate by persuading labor unions and private businesses to sign a `` solidarity pact'' that has put a lid on prices and wages in recent months. `` We have no option,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said. `` Either we succeed in making the economy work or the adverse social impacts will magnify.'' Presidential elections are scheduled for July 6, with the winner sworn in on Dec. 1 for a six-year term in office.

 If the 100 dogs at <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' testing center are any indication, the cracker company may have a winner on its hands with its new doggie breath fresheners meant to improve Fido's social skills.

The new product combines dog biscuits with breath mints. The biscuits, which will debut nationwide by the end of the month, are designed to clean teeth like regular Milkbones but also improve a dog's breath. `` There is a problem with halitosis among dogs,'' <PERSON> Gutsche </PERSON> said. `` This delivers the regular benefits plus the added benefits of mint.'' Others were skeptical. `` Milkbone is a good product, but I do n't think anything will work on a dog's breath except activated charcoal,'' which absorbs odors, said 45-year veteran veterinarian <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION>.

The trip will be awarded to the person farthest from <ORGANIZATION> Surrey </ORGANIZATION> who finds a balloon and contacts the chamber of commerce before May 31. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rempel </PERSON> of the chamber of commerce said Wednesday that two balloons recovered in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were the only others found outside <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to date. Meanwhile, a man in <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said Thursday he has n't had the same luck tracking down the origins of a balloon he found a few weeks ago. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> does n't have any idea just how far the balloon traveled before he snared it behind the factory where he works. Inside, it contained a message from `` Whitmore Elementary,'' but did n't include the name of the town. The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> checked its records but could find no Whitmore Elementary in the state. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he and a co-worker spotted the white balloon May 4 as it drifted to the ground. They noticed something inside and joked about splitting the contents. But it contained no promise of a free trip _ only a note about eating plenty of fruit and getting eight hours of sleep a night.

<HEAD>Survey: Variety Of Help Over Long Period Key To Quitting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Faddish `` one-shot'' strategies for quitting smoking, such as sensory deprivation and injections, usually wo n't hack it alone, says a survey that concludes the best course is getting a doctor's advice and support from others The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reviewed 39 studies of stop-smoking techniques. They ranged from the `` one-shot'' strategies to combinations of techniques like physician counseling, nicotine gum and behavioral therapy. `` Success was not associated with novel or unusual interventions,'' the research team reports in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Rather than quick fixes, the best way to stop smoking is through direct counseling from physicians and other experts, as well as the use of stop-smoking groups, booklets and self-help tapes, says a co-author of the report, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` I would ... tell the patient to avoid some of the very high-cost programs that offer some kind of magical approach,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` They are n't worth the money, and rarely work.'' <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> said he advises physicians to find out what kind of program a smoker would feel most comfortable with, and make a selection on that basis. `` Acupuncture or hypnotism, by themselves, do n't seem to work for long,'' he said, `` but there are cases where the patient has good rapport with the hypnotherapist or acupuncturist and gets lots of prolonged contact with them; then they can work.'' <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> cautioned in the report: `` There is no single intervention method clearly more effective for all people than the other methods.'' Instead, success in quitting was found to be `` the product of personalized smoking-cessation advice and assistance, repeated in different forms by several sources over the longest feasible period,'' said the survey by the government-coordinated research group. Nicotine gum was helpful, but it is available only through prescription and not everyone can use it, <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> said in the interview. He found the rate of smokers taking up the habit again is `` amazingly high.'' `` About a quarter of -LRB- the -RRB- people who try to quit relapse within two days, and half do in a week,'' he said. <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> said researchers found the `` recidivism rate'' was closely related to the length of time the smoker underwent counseling. `` Without repeated and prolonged contact _ in person, by telephone or by letter _ the best techniques can fail.'' A related report in the journal said a blood-pressure drug called clonidine has been shown effective in reducing the craving to smoke and helping people quit. That study focused on 71 heavy smokers who had tried unsuccessfully to quit. Thirty-three took clonidine and 38 took a placebo, with neither group knowing which it was taking. All subjects underwent behavioral therapy. Six months after discontinuing medication, 27 percent of the clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking, compared with 5 percent of those who took the placebo, the researchers said. Clonidine, also marketed as Catapres, inhibits some of the action of the nervous system. Its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that reported with nicotine gum, but clonidine may eventually prove superior because it does n't perpetuate nicotine dependence, the study suggested.

<HEAD>Prospective Jurors Screened As Mecham Criminal Trial Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> planned to spend the weekend weeding out obviously biased candidates for the jury in the former governor's criminal trial on charges he concealed a campaign loan. The trial began Thursday, when 100 prospective jurors were sworn in and filled out long questionnaires aimed in part at eliminating people who may have been influenced by the publicity surrounding the case. `` There goes my weekend,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, noting that attorneys on both sides hope to analyze the forms before meeting again Monday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, are charged with concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan by failing to report it on the former governor's campaign or personal finance statements. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, is charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office last month when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him on impeachment charges. He could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all six counts in the trial, while his brother could be sentenced to up to 9 -LCB- years if convicted on the three counts he faces. Neither attended Thursday's initial session in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> probably will attend court next week, after the questioning of potential jurors begins. The questionnaire was worked out by the prosecution, defense and trial Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Among the 99 questions were whether the panelists know anyone involved in the case, whether they signed or circulated petitions for or against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> while he was governor and whether they belong to the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Also, they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list of people associated with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> or his criminal case. The former governor has refused to predict whether he will fare better in court than at his impeachment trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on April 4, 15 months into his first term, by convicting him of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was also impeached on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial. Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the loan from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> until after a newspaper reported it in October 1987. On Wednesday, a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice refused a defense request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense motion to return the charges to the grand jury. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to hear arguments on that issue June 1. The defense filed two new motions, released Thursday. One asks the judge to dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign and personal finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally `` vague, ambiguous, imprecise and overbroad.'' The other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury for a new finding of whether probable cause exists. That motion argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the prosecutors in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> did not schedule arguments on the motions.

<TEXT>
 Sikh radicals were blamed for the killings of 14 more people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. At the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, crews worked today to clear <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine of debris from a 10-day siege by security forces. Five of the victims killed Thursday night in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state were Hindu migrant workers from the eastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>. Police said the workers were lined up against a wall and shot by eight Sikh gunmen, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The killings occurred in <LOCATION> Chinna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Singh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. It was the second attack on migrant workers this week, suggesting that the extremists are trying to undercut agriculture, the mainstay of this northern state's economy. On Tuesday night, Sikh gunmen killed more than 30 Hindu workers as they slept at a camp near the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. Other deaths reported Thursday night which police blamed on Sikhs included five people killed in a village in <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and four shot to death as they waited for a bus in <LOCATION> Bhatinda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. The deaths raised to more than 1,100 the number of people killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. In all of 1987, about 1,030 people were slain. Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where they are a majority. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people and claim they are discriminated against by the nation's majority Hindus State-run <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unidentified government official in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> as saying cleaning was nearly complete at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and `` steps are being taken to restore traditional rituals.'' The government siege of the temple ended Wednesday with the surrender of the last Sikh extremists. Police cordoned off the complex May 9 after radicals inside fired on police officers conducting an inspection outside its walls, wounding five of them. Rituals at the golden-domed temple include a continuous reading of the Sikh holy book, the Guru <PERSON> Granth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahib </PERSON>, and the singing of hymns. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Visitors to the inner sanctum of the temple often take a ceremonial dip in the surrounding pool, which is considered sacred. On Thursday, bomb disposal squads searched the temple to make sure the surrendering extremists did not leave explosives behind. There were no reports of any explosives being found.

<HEAD>Officials Say Dropping Noriega Charges Could Crush Morale in War

 Morale among prosecutors and drug agents battling narcotics trafficking could be undermined if drug charges are dropped against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, say those involved in the case. `` Why are we prosecuting all these people?'' asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>. `` Why are we investigating all these people who do drugs, when people who sit outside this country and allow their own countries to be used for drug trafficking can make deals without even our input?'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the handling of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case `` sends one signal to the law enforcement community and sends a totally opposite signal to the drug traffickers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Are we just wasting our time?'' he asked. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, whose office brought the indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week to try to block any deal for dropping the charges. He criticized his exclusion from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I have not had a single phone call from anybody,'' he said Wednesday. `` I'm upset. Apparently, I guess, I'm going to find out what's going to happen to our cases at the same time as everybody else does.'' Not long before the reports of the negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> surfaced, <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> announced late last month he would be leaving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's post to rejoin his old law firm. He said he was leaving for personal reasons. Chief Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> said the possibility of a political defeat in the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case has crushed his spirit and that of other prosecutors and agents in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who worked on the case. `` We've spent a lot of time and effort making this case,'' he said. `` The assistants who worked on the case in this office and myself ... would certainly be most disappointed if the case is not allowed to go forward.'' Other prosecutors, however, had mixed reactions to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Senatore </PERSON>, a prosecutor in the public corruption section, said he differentiates between `` any political decisions that go on in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' and `` my job of fighting crime here in this district.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on drug and racketeering charges. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is conducting negotiations to drop the charges in exchange for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s agreement to step aside as leader of the troubled nation

 Lawyers for detained Palestinians claimed the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military justice system has buckled under a flood of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> inmates, but army sources said prisons will be centralized and computerized for efficiency. Many of the thousands of Palestinians imprisoned during the 5-month-old uprising in the occupied lands are held incommunicado for weeks or miss court appearances because authorities ca n't locate them, their lawyers said Thursday `` It's a big mess,'' Israeli lawyer <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsemel </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The army is completely inefficient.'' Also Thursday, left-wing Israeli legislator <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> issued new figures on detentions. He said 1,900 Arabs _ one in every 200 men over 18 _ are being held in jail for six months without trial. Another 8,100 Palestinians are in prison awaiting trial or serving sentences for specific charges, <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. Similar figures were released by Law in the Service of Man, a human rights monitoring group founded by <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> lawyers. The organization said between 7,000 and 9,000 Palestinians are in jails, in addition to about 2,000 administrative detainees held without trial. Since the uprising started Dec. 8, 17,000 Palestinians _ 4 percent of the male population over 14 _ have been detained, said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a lawyer and member of the human rights group. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials refused comment, saying they had to check their detention figures. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today quoted the army legal adviser in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dudu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahav </PERSON>, a saying 1,800 Palestinians were being held without trial in administrative detention. Most are leaders of the outlawed youth group <ORGANIZATION> Shabibe </ORGANIZATION>, which is linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, <PERSON> Yahav </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He said most detainees were being held without trial because there was insufficient evidence to bring them to court. A military prosecutor said last week that 5,000 Palestinians were being held, including 1,700 in administrative detention. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 191 Palestinians have been killed since anti-occupation protests began in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Two Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the lands from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The army has built five detention centers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied lands to accommodate those detained during the unrest and has housed some detainees in 17 other prisons. A military source said Thursday that the army is adopting several measures to make the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> prison system more efficient. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the army plans to appoint a high-ranking officer to oversee all prisons in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, install a computer in each facility to keep track of prisoners, and close smaller detention centers. And a senior officer in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s central command, identified only as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON>, was quoted as saying that detainees with the same legal status will be housed in the same prison. All administrative detainees will be moved to a prison camp in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON> as saying. Lawyers for Palestinian prisoners were skeptical about the plans. `` We have filed many complaints, and now they say they are going to organize everything,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Tsemel </PERSON>. `` We've been hearing this for two months.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tsemel </PERSON> said she and several colleagues sent a letter to the army on Wednesday saying the lawyers strike if the situation does not improve. Lawyer <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, who has represented more than 100 Palestinians, said she often searched for clients two or three weeks before prison authorities located them. `` Even those who are charged are sometimes not brought to court on the date of their trial,'' Ms. <PERSON> Langer </PERSON> added. `` The only thing that will improve the situation is to release people and not to treat them as animals, dehumanize them,'' she added. Israeli officials have denied allegations of mistreatment and inefficiency. <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today as saying that three soldiers were investigated recently on charges they mistreated prisoners, and three detainees were released after a probe showed they were being held without justification. In another development Thursday, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military government permitted reunification of 40 Palestinian families as a goodwill gesture. The government applies stringent standards in issuing residency permits, often granting only temporary tourist visas to foreign-born spouses of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents. As a result, hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> families are separated.

<HEAD>8-Year-Old Arrested for Alleged Drug Dealing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 8-year-old boy described as a diligent student was arrested for selling cocaine on a city street corner, and his mother said she did everything she could to stop him, including moving to a new home. Police said they arrested the boy and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 20, after watching them conduct several drug sales Wednesday night. Sgt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bealfeld </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had used the second-grader to conduct several drug sales before they were arrested. Police confiscated 14 bags of cocaine worth about $ 280 from the child after a brief chase that ended at his back porch. `` Using kids this young is becoming the trend rather than the exception, `` <PERSON> Bealfeld </PERSON> said. The boy's 28-year-old mother said Thursday she had found bags of cocaine on him in the past and returned them to the dealers. `` I told him, ` They are going to catch you holding drugs,''' she said. She even took him on a tour of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> last month but `` it did n't do any good,'' she said. The boy said he spent the money he received, about $ 4 or $ 5. `` The carnival's been here two weeks, and he played the carnival all two weeks,'' said the mother. The boy was described by his school principal as a diligent student in his second-grade special education class. `` He turns his homework in on time, completes all his assignments. ... He is really a good student,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bentalou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winterling </PERSON>. `` I think he knew that drugs were somehow bad, but at his age it's a lot different to say drugs are bad, do n't mess with them, than it is to say the stove is hot, do n't touch it,'' <PERSON> Bealfeld </PERSON> said. The boy's mother said she moved from a public housing project to a rowhouse with her twin sister to get away from an environment of drug dealing but her current neighborhood is just as bad. The boy's father was killed in a drug-related shooting in the housing projects, and the boy witnessed a drug-related slaying of a 23-year-old man three years ago, she said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was charged with possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and using a minor to distribute cocaine. The boy was charged as a juvenile with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was later taken home.

 In response to a court order, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has agreed that 968 would-be delegates to the party's state convention in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> can appeal their disqualifications. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Raudonis </PERSON> announced Thursday evening that the delegates could appear today before the party's interim credentials committee in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. They also have a right to appeal to the full convention, he said. The two-day convention was scheduled to start today at the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Towson </PERSON> ruled Thursday afternoon that the 968 disqualified delegates can go to the convention and appeal their status. In his temporary restraining order, the <LOCATION> Laurens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge enjoined the party from deciding the fate of the contested delegates without first notifying them of their right to appeal. He also enjoined the party from denying them admission to the convention or restricting their rights. <PERSON> Raudonis </PERSON> said the 11-member credentials committee would begin meeting today and the challenges probably would be heard on a county-by-county basis. After all appeals are heard, the committee will issue a report to the full convention, which will then hear any appeals and vote on the list of approved delegates.

The first annual international AIDS gathering drew about 3,000 participants in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1985. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. There is no known cure. AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Rebels Balk At Returning To Managua, Deny New Peace Talks
Scheduled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rebel leaders are refusing to hold the next round of peace talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> unless the leftist government lifts restrictions on the media and allows the Contras to move freely in the capital city. The Contras, as the rebels are known, also disagreed on Thursday with a Sandinista government statement that a third round of peace talks has been scheduled. The government reported Wednesday that negotiators would meet May 25-28. Contra leaders said they would prefer the talks resume today in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The government statement said the site of the talks was undecided, but that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed that they take place in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, where two rounds of negotiations have been held. The U.S.-backed Contras complained that during the previous sessions the government forced them to remain in a hotel near the international airport and prevented them from meeting with internal opposition leaders. In their statement Thursday, the Contras said they would return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> only if the government agreed to `` suspend all censorship of communications media and end the threats and mistreatment by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> officials against independent broadcasters.'' The statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the Contras should be allowed to meet local opposition leaders and make their case on radio and television. The government said Wednesday it would allow the rebels to meet with the main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, at the hotel where they stayed before. The rebels want to stay at a more centrally located site. Negotiations are aimed at reaching a permanent truce in the civil war, which began in November 1981. The two sides signed an agreement on March 23 for a 60-day cease-fire that expires May 30. Negotiators have been unable to work out details for a permanent truce, although they have agreed on seven zones where the rebels are to gather during a cease-fire. The two sides remain far apart on such issues as democratic reforms and what role Contra leaders will play in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political future In another development, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday announced approval of a $ 10 million grant to monitor compliance with the Nicaraguan peace process. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, Contra rebel leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said a recent split in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> ranks over the military leadership of Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> has been resolved. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a director of the Contra umbrella group, the Miami-based Nicaraguan Resistance, said: `` The internal military conflict provoked by several commanders now has been overcome and Col. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was confirmed in his job as supreme military chief of our forces.'' There were reports late last week that up to 4,000 Contra guerrillas gathered around a base camp in <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of the Honduran border, to protest <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>' command. Sources had said some rebels charged <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> with corruption and inefficiency. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said there were only about 200 dissidents at the base camp. `` I can guarantee 100 percent that our troops are now unified again and support the directorship of the Nicaraguan Resistance in the negotations that we have with the Sandinista government,'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Free Trade Agreement Renews Debate Over Exporting Water To The
U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The proposals are Gargantuan: a 400-mile Grand Canal from the icy rivers of northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the Great Lakes, or an irrigation trench through the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to the parched American West. Could the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, now in the process of ratification, make such massive diversions of fresh water a reality? The subject was debated Thursday when two Canadian experts disclosed that the trade agreement treats water like newsprint, computers and other `` goods'' now subject to tariffs. The treaty will eliminate those tariffs and offer the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` national treatment'' when it comes to Canadian water, said former trade negotiator <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. The discovery, they said, contradicts claims by the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> that water was not part of the trade deal. When questioned in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Trade Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> indirectly confirmed that water exports are possible under the treaty. But <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> told opponents that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can not be forced to sell water or any other natural resource. `` We are not obliged to sell one thimbleful of -LRB- water -RRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said, citing a federal announcement last November that large-scale water diversions will not be contemplated. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> wanted water exempted from the trade deal but abandoned the demand in final compromises with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. `` In the 11th hour, we did n't get all the changes we wanted,'' he said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said the world General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which both countries recognize, allows a member to ban exports of natural resources on grounds of conservation and environmental protection. On that basis, he said, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will not permit diversions of fresh water. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s pledge under the Free Trade Agreement to share energy resources in times of crisis only covers items currently exported, such as gas and oil. `` We're not now exporting water, only dribs and drabs,'' he said. Border towns in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> export small quantities to local water systems in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and there are proposals to export water by tanker from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. In any case, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said, even the thirstiest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states are no longer considering long-distance diversions because of the cost. Instead, they are focusing on a transition from agricultural to municipal use of local water. Should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> run dry, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does seem a handy solution. With 7 percent of the world's land area, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has 9 percent of its renewable fresh water supply and only 1 percent of its population. Eight percent of the country is covered by lakes. The problem is that 60 percent of the water flows north toward the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and is inaccessible to most Canadians, who live huddled near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. Thus the grand schemes. <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> engineer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kierans </PERSON> has spent 30 years promoting his dream of turning <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert into lush farmland with water diverted from the rivers of northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, now flowing north into <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>. Pumping stations would propel the water into a Grand Canal across the Canadian Shield to the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>. From the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, it would be pumped to the prairies and desert. The estimated cost of construction alone: $ 100 billion. The same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parsons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> engineers, to divert the Yukon and <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> rivers through the Rocky Mountain Trench of western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A comprehensive Canadian study in 1985 advised a `` cautious approach'' to such projects but called it `` imprudent to reject all exports out of hand.'' The author of that report, Professor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearse </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the Grand Canal was `` not in anybody's interest on ecological or economic grounds.'' He said it would cost $ 2,000 per thousand cubic meters simply to get the water to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentalists oppose transferring water from one basin to another because of the ecological impact and disruption to Indians and Inuit dependent on fishing and hunting. `` It's always been a fear that this is on somebody's agenda,'' said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, Canadian director of the Friends of the Earth. `` We have n't paid enough attention to real water conservation to be even considering these kinds of megaprojects.''

 Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> revealed that a Nicaraguan journalist working as a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> agent had `` carried out missions in the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' a government newspaper reported. Barricada, the newspaper of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday quoted <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON> <PERSON> Checa </PERSON> was `` a counterintelligence agent who worked in enemy ranks.'' <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON>, 34, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is a niece of the late <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, the pro-American dictator who was overthrown by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in July 1979.

The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s press office said Thursday that it had no further information on <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON> But a source in the Sandinista front, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON> is under protection of state security and may soon hold a news conference. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, said: `` My client has instructed me to confirm the accuracy of Mr. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>'s statement.'' <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said he had no information about whether <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON> worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or the Sandinistas while she was employed by American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> news organizations during five years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> declined further comment.

<TEXT>
 A Vietnam-era law that has been the focus of a long-running fight between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be overhauled by a proposal introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our goal is to make the statute more workable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the measure to reform the War Powers `` Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at this legislation. The War Powers Act has never really worked,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> Thursday about the existing legislation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With some reservation, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed federal legislation approving the <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. In a statement announcing his signature, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Thursday hailed the more than three quarters of the states that have now entered compacts on low-level radioactive waste, but he warned the Appalachian commission against attempting to enforce federal laws.. He said the compacts `` underscore this nation's commitment to take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> objected, however, to a provision of the bill giving the commission federal law enforcement responsibility without requiring that commissioners be appointed according to the appointments clause of the Constitution. `` Any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations would contravene the Constitution,'' the president said. Under the compact _ which includes <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ the four states are required to ensure that there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the region's low-level waste, and that each state has equal access to it

 A truck driver has made state lottery history by winning two jackpots, with his latest prize totaling more than $ 6 million, lottery officials announced. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, who said he spends $ 45 a week on the game, bought the computer-picked Wild Card Lotto ticket May 6. The total annuity value of the jackpot is $ 6,364,818.18, the 12th largest individual prize won in lottery history, lottery officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> won his first lottery jackpot on March 7, 1986, and shared the prize with four other winners. His share totaled $ 421,433.25. He is the first person to win two jackpots since the game began in 1972, said lottery Executive Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>. Combined, <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON>' prizes have an annuity value of $ 6,786,251.43. His net annual earnings from both wins are more than a $ 250,000. `` I'm ecstatic,'' <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said after receiving his first of 21 payments of $ 242,469.27. `` I always had it in the back of my mind that I was going to -LRB- win -RRB- again.'' <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said he has been playing the Lotto and Super 7 lotteries since the early 1970s. He said he buys 15 tickets three nights a week, then carefully records the winning numbers. `` I believe in giving yourself a winning edge,'' he said. `` You've got to try to cut down the odds.'' His initial reaction to the news was caution, then elation, and finally speculation about what he should do with the winnings, <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said. Cars, homes and other such luxuries first came to mind, he said, but he and his wife <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> decided instead to spend the money helping out relatives. <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said he would take some time off from his job as a truck driver for <ORGANIZATION> Marstan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wo n't be climbing on the truck real soon,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced today that 1,013 prisoners will be released Saturday under special a parole to mark <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s birthday.

<TEXT>
 A self-described racist indicted on a charge of threatening to kill black presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he's innocent and authorities ca n't `` railroad'' him for his beliefs. `` My views should n't persecute me, actions should,'' <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday after a federal grand jury returned the indictment. `` I have n't done anything. I have n't taken any actions towards Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. My views have n't pointed a gun at anyone. `` They ca n't railroad me just because of what I believe,'' he told the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> -LRB- Ill. -RRB- News-Democrat in an interview from the federal detention facility at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was named in all four counts of the indictment. His wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, 27, was named in three of the counts, but she was not accused of being involved in the threat on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life. Federal agents initially said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> claimed he belonged to two violent white-supremacist groups: the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord, otherwise known as CSA, and The Order. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouden </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said he had found no evidence <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> or his wife belonged to the groups. And leaders of the groups said they never heard of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` It's possible that there are people who say they're in The Order,'' said Order leader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 34, in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` But they're not writing me letters telling me what they're planning.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is one of two men convicted in the slaying of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> in 1984. <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, one of two wives of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, said Thursday she never heard of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who is in hiding, answered questions for the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> through a third party. Both of the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> have denied any links to organized white supremacist groups, and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> passed a lie detector test on the subject. The indictment differs from the initial arrest charges, which accused the couple of being part of a conspiracy to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It does not appear to be a large overall plot as was first reported,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The indictment said that on or about May 10, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` knowingly and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily harm upon <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' It charges both of the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> with possessing an AR-15 assault rifle that had been altered to make it fire like a machine gun. The gun was to be used in a plot to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the government said. The pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to harm a government informant in retaliation. Prosecutors and the couple's attorneys met for several hours after the indictments were issued but declined comment afterward. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' lawyer, would say only that `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are scared.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a construction worker, faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines on the first count. On each of the other three counts, the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $ 250,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> set arraignment for Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION>, who live in rural eastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> with their three daughters, have been held without bond since federal agents arrested them Friday at their apartment. The arrests were announced Tuesday. <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Sheriff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruns </PERSON> said an informer told investigators that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> not only possessed the rifle, but that he was part of a plot to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on June 21 or July 4. The sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area, where they found the rifle. A <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent testified Tuesday that agents taped a conversation in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the informer that the Covenant wanted the rifle back and was planning <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s assassination.

 There was little change in the dollar today but share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed higher despite a computer problem during the morning session. The dollar finished the day at 124.82 yen, 0.02 yen higher than Thursday's close of 128.80 yen. After opening at 124.85 yen, the dollar moved in a narrow range of 124.80 to 124.90 yen. `` Because a long weekend is nearing, traders do n't seem to be enthusiastic about setting up a new position,'' said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukuzawa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Markets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be closed Monday in observance of Whitsunday. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 20.61 points, or 0.08 percent from Thursday to close at 27,393.85. `` The strong dollar lifted share prices, but not as much as the market expected,'' added <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office. `` Overall trading was slow because of concern over the inflation and the beginning of a long weekend,'' he said. Traders said the brief computer shutdown during the early morning session kept the market from recovering further after two consecutive days of decline. The computer system at the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> shut down shortly after 9:00 a.m. -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- during a bullish period in the market, traders said. `` The computer problem may have had some effects on the market in the sense that it could discourage investors from taking a position,'' said a trader at a major securities firm. `` But it is also true that there are other elements of concern such as inflation and rising interest rates.'' <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> TSE </ORGANIZATION> said they were forced to shut down the entire computer system briefly to swith the main system to a reserve system. The computer that controlled the trading of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shares, one of the most popular shares in recent trading, became inoperable, he said. <PERSON> Hirano </PERSON> denied speculation that excess orders for the shares caused the computer to break down. Investigations were continuing into the system failure, he said. The volume traded today was 800 million shares.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to open a trade office in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, local business leaders said today. Some high-ranking Soviet officials expressed their interest when South Korean businessmen visited <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> last week to take part in an electronics show, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> and three other top South Korean electronics firms are participating in the `` Leningrad Electronics Show,'' which opened May 12 in that Soviet city for an 11-day run. It is the first time South Korean firms have been invited to a trade show in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, the two countries have been expanding sports, cultural and economic contacts in recent years. <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-soo </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION>'s motor sales department, quoted I.T. <PERSON> Kanaev </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, as saying: `` We hope to open a trade office in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> immediately after the Olympics.'' The Games begin in September. <PERSON> Kanaev </PERSON> specifically asked <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> managing director <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-ki </PERSON> to help with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> plan and relay it to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Koo </PERSON>, who returned from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> early this week, said <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyurshin </PERSON> also called for expanded trade contact with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> when he visited a <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> showroom. The Goldstar and other South Korean showrooms attracted about 1,000 people daily and many Soviet officials said they wanted to import electronic parts such as motors and color television tubes from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> said. Trade between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has so far been conducted through third countries. Their two-way trade was estimated at $ 140 million in 1986. Figures for 1987 were unavailable.

 Two men who died on the same day were mistaken for each other, leading one to be cremated in the other's place while horrified mourners viewed the wrong man in an open coffin Both men died May 9 and were taken to the morgue at <LOCATION> Yale-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, authorities said. Both were transported from there to <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> funeral homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>, one of the funeral home's owners, blamed the hospital. `` The tags were wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> said his attorney was preparing to file a complaint with the state against the hospital. Authorities said the body of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> was to have been buried May 13 but instead was cremated. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>, 73, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> was to have been cremated, but his body appeared dressed in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>'s suit in an open coffin May 12 during calling hours at the funeral home in <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Urtz </PERSON>, a hospital spokesman, said four bodies were released May 9 to <ORGANIZATION> Sisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, which was handling arrangements for all four, and added, `` We take great precautions to make sure that we appropriately identify bodies before they leave the hospital.'' The Eagans filed a complaint Thursday against the funeral home with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The family also hired an investigator to find out who made the error. `` There had to be an extremely large number of mistakes made in order for this to have happened,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branford </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s three sons. `` There had to be major negligence. I would never want another family to have to go through this.'' The Eagans must cope with the knowledge that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> was cremated against his and his family's wishes, said the family's attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> died unexpectedly overnight and the wake was important to the family, <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> `` The grieving process is an important part of dealing with it, and the wake is an important part of the whole structure,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>, said the funeral home did not tell the family what had happened, other than to ask that a relative on May 13 affirm the identity of the deceased <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said Thursday he did not know who was responsible for the mistake. He said the family filed the complaint to make sure a similar mistake does n't happen again. It was filed against the funeral home because `` they're the ones that ultimately made the arrangements,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said. A state medical examiner had signed a certificate that allowed <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s cremation, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s cremated remains were placed in a casket May 13 by <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> Funeral Home, which replaced <ORGANIZATION> Sisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the family. A traditional funeral was held, along with a mass of Christian burial and burial of the remains. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>'s body since has been cremated. A memorial service for him was held at <ORGANIZATION> Sisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Striking scriptwriters and representatives of the television and movie industry will have another go-round with a federal mediator, even though two previous sessions produced little progress. `` The chief negotiators have been exploring a possible solution to the impasse and feel a meeting at this time is in order,'' both parties said in a joint statement Thursday. The meeting, scheduled for Monday, will be the third such mediated session since the strike began 11 weeks ago. The last ended after only 20 minutes on April 18, and a meeting March 14 also failed to bring results. The 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> struck the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> on March 7 over disagreements on residual payments for reruns, works distributed in foreign countries and creative control. The strike has hobbled the movie and TV industry, forcing many TV shows into early reruns and stalling movie production. Federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> scheduled the meeting for Monday afternoon at the alliance's Sherman Oaks headquarters. The meeting comes at a time when guild negotiating committees are believed to be on the verge of signing at least 20 contracts with independent production companies desperate to resume work. Another 60 such companies also are negotiating with the guild. While the producers face the possibility of some companies resuming work while others remain idle, the writers sent letters Wednesday to 11 production companies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> studios and several soap opera producers, asking for the names and addresses of replacement scriptwriters they are using. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> letters appear to be the first major acknowledgement by the guild that substantial numbers of replacement writers are being hired to foil their strike. `` Your company apparently has employed one or more persons to perform WGA-covered writing services since the strike began,'' says the letter, signed by <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> is entitled under federal labor law to the name and address of each of these persons. ...'' `` We are asking for this information fo the purpose of policing our contract,'' said guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. On Thursday, the alliance announced it would file an unfair labor practice charge against the guild. The union's decision to publicize its letter `` attempted to coerce writers and the exercise of their legally protected right to work,'' which is protected under the National Labor Relations Act, said alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Report Says Rookie Operator Caused Cable Car Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An error by an inexperienced cable car operator who nevertheless managed to warn his passengers of danger caused a crash this week that injured 36 people, a federal investigator said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, who had been a cable car gripman less than a month, did not properly tighten the car's grip on the underground cable, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. A lever operated by gripmen clamps metal dies against the cable, preventing the car from moving faster than 9 -LCB- mph, the speed of the cable. The operator's error Monday allowed the car to slip down Hyde Street, two blocks above Fisherman's Wharf, and to slam into a truck at a red light, sending some of the 40 tourists and other passengers flying into the intersection. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> recommended gripmen be given more training and that automobiles be banned from the tracks on the two-block stretch where the accident occurred. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said several factors contributed to the accident, including rain-soaked tracks on the steep hill, the cable car's outmoded braking system and the fact that cars and trucks also drive on the tracks He praised the gripman, however, for yelling to passengers moments before the crash, `` Hold on!'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also contradicted reports by witnesses that the car sped up to 25 mph. The car was traveling no faster than 15 to 18 mph when it hit the truck, he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stead </PERSON>, manager of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the cable cars, had no comment on the report. <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> also declined to talk to a reporter. Meanwhile, a $ 2 million claim was filed Thursday against the city on behalf of a couple injured in the crash. The claim, filed by attorney <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> for <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuttenberg </PERSON>, was the first stemming from the accident to be submitted to the city attorney.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors agreed to drop misdemeanor charges against the parents of a man convicted in a fatal drunken-driving accident if they joined their son when he speaks to students as part of his sentence. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>, a city councilwoman, and her husband <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> agreed to participate in the speaking tour as part of the settlement of charges that they served alcohol to minors at their daughter's wedding reception. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 20, is serving a three-year sentence after pleading guilty Feb. 3 to two counts of DUI-manslaughter. The crash last June 13 killed <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Blundell </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Steverson </PERSON>, 17, as <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> was driving them home from the reception. <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>'s blood-alcohol level was 0.15 percent after the accident. A person is considered legally intoxicated in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with a level of 0.10 percent. His parents were charged last month with two counts each of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and giving alcoholic beverages to persons under 21. Prosecutors said Wednesday they would drop the misdemeanor charges against the parents if they joined their son in talking to students in all <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> middle and high schools about the tragedy and their role in it. The speaking tour was part of the younger <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>'s sentence. `` It was a very easy way out of a very difficult situation,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>, 40, who was set to go to trial with her husband May 23. `` We realized that a trial would n't have done anyone any good,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>, who was re-elected to the council last month before charges against her and her husband were filed. `` The agreement was something that made the point for everyone,'' said State Attorney <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>. `` I told my assistants from the start that we were not out for blood in this situation.'' The pre-trial agreement signed Wednesday did not include any plea or any admittance of guilt. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said he did not want the criminal case to interfere with any civil litigation. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Blundell </PERSON> is charging in a civil suit that the Cermaks caused his daughter's death by letting their son get drunk at the reception. The younger <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to a charge of altering his driver's license to indicate that he was 21, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s drinking age. He has since been enrolled in a 90-day prison program for youthful offenders. If he completes it, he could be free about July 25. He and his probation officer will then set up his lecture schedule.

 The two remaining Democratic candidates are planning a meeting to discuss strategy and a platform for their party's national convention, according to one of the candidates. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that he had spoken to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by telephone about the meeting, and he said the two hoped to get together while they are both campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prior to the June 7 primary. Both candidates are scheduled to be in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> today. `` We must keep in mind our role is to expand and unify our party,'' <PERSON> Jackosn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave no other details on the meeting. Earlier in the day <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took his campaign to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s farmland, telling students to give life a chance without drugs and agricultural workers to preserve their fields from dangerous chemicals <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave several scheduled interviews Thursday morning before embarking on a full day of appearances in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, stressing agricultural themes such as keeping farms in the family. A private fund-raiser netted $ 50,000 for the Democratic presidential hopeful, who faces a tough battle in the state's primary against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also spoke at a `` Latino Salute to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' at the Civic Auditorium in this <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> city 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. At a noon rally before a mostly white crowd of 4,000 Kern County high school students, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> blew a kiss and gave a thumbs-up sign as multi-colored balloons were released into the sky. `` I can sense the joy in the air, the sense of hope, the celebration of people coming together because we care,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said as students clapped and chanted `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'' from the bleachers at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took off his suit jacket to put on a yellow and green T-shirt bearing a Viking, the school's mascot. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the students to chant `` I am somebody'' and asked those who knew of friends who either tried drugs or attempted suicide to stand. `` That's why my heart is heavy and you bring tears to my eyes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said as nearly the entire group stood up. `` You have to make a big decision today. You have to give life a chance. You have to give hope a chance.'' About 100 students who claimed they had tried drugs joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the field afterward. `` He's just not talking politics, he made a lot of sense. He's the first person I've heard -LRB- talk about drugs -RRB- who I understood,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 16, who declined to give her last name <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also went to nearby <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, a farming town where 12 children have contracted cancer and half of those have died. While the cause of the cancer is unknown, parents fear agricultural chemicals played a part. `` So long as we poison the environment, and as we contaminate the water and the air, we will poison the people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He ended the evening by bringing the audience of 2,500 to its feet with cries of `` Jackson, action!'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared relaxed, just two days after a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> couple was arrested in an alleged assassination plot against him.

 A former pro-Soviet Polish leader who helped crush the Solidarity movement later followed the woman he loves to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and lives a quiet, middle-class life here, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` It's almost as if <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> or <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> or someone like that turned up in a dacha outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Glowacki </PERSON>, a Polish playwright now living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told the newspaper. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olszowski </PERSON>, 57, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August 1986 because of his love for <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Skowron </PERSON>, a Polish international civil servant, the Times reported. They were married last month and live in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. When he left his wife for Ms. <PERSON> Skowron </PERSON>, the scandal shook the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and contributed to his ouster as foreign minister and Politburo member in 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Skowron </PERSON> was transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she is a liaison officer with <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Olszowski </PERSON> accompanied her. The couple have a 4-year-old son, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>. His move to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has astounded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Polish experts, as well as emigres, many of whom left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after Solidarity was suppressed by martial law in December 1981. `` It's a remarkable example of moral cynicism and ideological hypocrisy,'' <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, a national security adviser in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, told the Times. `` This is a man who, back home, is a stalwart doctrinarian who favored the bloody use of force to crush Solidarity.'' <PERSON> Olszowski </PERSON>, in an interview with the Times, insisted that he was here just for `` personal reasons.'' `` I am just a private person,'' he said. <PERSON> Olszowski </PERSON> was twice almost installed as the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in place of <LOCATION> Stansilaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kania </LOCATION>, during the 16 months Solidarity was a legal union and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was reeling through a period of liberalization and crisis.

 A pro-government newspaper published photographs of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employees and their families so that Panamanians will `` know the Gringos who are starving us to death.'' The supplement in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION>, a propaganda organ of the government, said the Americans `` think the walls of their embassy are impregnable.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said it was a significant escalation of what they called a harassment campaign by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is chief of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the civilian government. `` We take this seriously,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` Saying ` Panamanians, these are your enemies,' and putting it in a very shrill way in front of a public in which there are known paramilitary groups is not a very wholesome thing to do. Combined with the rhetoric, it is cause for concern,'' <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed severe economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to make him resign. A 10-foot-high fence of iron bars surrounds the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy grounds on seaside <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. The embassy building is about 25 yards from the fence, within easy reach of projectiles from the street. The embassy's physical barriers are almost identical to those of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which anti-American protesters burned and sacked in April. The front page of the 36-page supplement published by <PERSON> Critica </PERSON> on Thursday shows photos of the embassy building, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maisto </PERSON>, deputy chief of mission. It says in bold print: `` Panamanian: Know the Gringos who are starving us to death.'' A preface to the list of embassy personnel said: `` These are the ones who think the walls of their embassy are impregnable, that their computers are infallible. `` These are the ones who carry out the strategy of <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who wants to kill thousands of Panamanians in order to impose a docile government that would hand the country over to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, has been a central figure in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> policy. <PERSON> Critica </PERSON>'s list of embassy employees includes the names of 85 diplomats and and 64 dependents, most of them spouses. Following the list are pages of photocopies of identity documents issued to embassy personnel by the Panamanian government. These include photographs, but most are of such poor quality as to be unrecognizable in newsprint reproduction. In all, the documents of 363 embassy personnel and dependents _ including children _ are reproduced, but many are outdated. According to <PERSON> Critica </PERSON>, the source of the list and documents was The Committee for Panamanian Dignity and Sovereignty. It was the first known public mention of the committee. The newspaper, which includes ranking military officers on its board, said the committee obtained the information from an `` intelligence branch'' that had the cooperation of `` patriotic Panamanians and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends.'' It said it would provide addresses and telephone numbers of the Americans in coming days, which <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said would make the matter `` that much more serious.''

 Sinhalese extremists with automatic weapons fatally wounded a senior official of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as he left his <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> home today, police said. Two men opened fire with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles as <PERSON> Nandalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> was being driven to his office, said police inspector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalupahana </PERSON>. He said the gunmen and a third suspect escaped on a motorcyle. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> was shot in the stomach and hand and died three hours later at a hospital, police officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said the attack was carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of ultranationalist Sinhalese who have vowed to kill anyone who supports President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s efforts to make peace with the Tamil minority. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> held the fourth-highest post in <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s party as secretary general. The party's chairman was assassinated last December. The government has blamed the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the killings of about 260 government officials and supporters since July 29, when <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> signed a peace accord to end the Tamil insurgency. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, belongs to the Sinhalese ethnic group that controls the government and comprises 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamils, who account for 18 percent, say they are discriminated against in jobs and education. Tamil militants have been waging a guerrilla war against the government and Sinhalese civilians for nearly five years. The rebels rejected the peace accord, which provides greater autonomy in Tamil-populated areas if the guerrillas surrender their weapons. Sinhalese militants also reject the accord, saying it gives too much to the Tamils. To enforce the accord, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, an island off its southern coast, but Tamil militants are now fighting the Indian troops. On May 10, the government lifted a five-year ban on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s political activities after announcing it had signed a peace agreement with the Sinhalese radicals The group denied reaching such an agreement and has continued attacks on Sinhalese politicians.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Hospital To Eliminate Waiting List For AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered a hospital to eliminate a waiting list for AZT, the only federally approved AIDS drug, and to begin offering an experimental treatment to indigent patients. State District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> signed a temporary restraining order Thursday against <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and five Parkland patients filed a lawsuit claiming the hospital failed to provide adequate treatment for AIDS patients. The lawsuit also listed seven `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' plaintiffs who Parkland officials say died in recent months while waiting to receive AZT. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ordered a trial within 30 days to determine whether a special master should be named to monitor Parkland's handling of AIDS patients. `` To whom must the victim turn?'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said in a strongly worded statement. `` Obviously, the public must intervene or else adopt a policy that says, ` Let them die because we ca n't afford them.' Such a result is not tolerable in a society that for over 200 years has prided itself on placing human values first.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON>, president of the gay alliance, said he is `` gratified that the judge has ruled in favor of life,'' and added, `` It's unfortunate that Parkland did not listen to us before now.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Parkland's chief executive officer, said in a statement after the ruling that the county's only public hospital must balance the needs of AIDS patients against increasing numbers of other indigent patients, including pregnant women, elderly people and trauma victims. `` AIDS patients are very ill at times and require compassionate, humane care that we are doing our best to deliver,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The patients receive treatment at a clinic that Parkland jointly runs with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The clinic is providing treatment for 679 patients suffering from AIDS; AIDS-related complex, a less-serious form of the disease; or the virus that causes the disease. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, chief legal counsel for Parkland, said the hospital intended to comply with <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s order. However, he indicated that AIDS patients still may have a difficult time seeing a doctor at the clinic. `` I can say we will eliminate the -LRB- AZT -RRB- waiting list, but when they -LRB- AIDS patients -RRB- can get an appointment to the clinic and when they can see a doctor is another issue entirely,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. The suit accused Parkland of violating state and federal laws by not providing enough doctors to handle the number of AIDS patients and by withholding some treatments that are readily available to patients at other hospitals. Parkland officials said they have been unable to find physicians interested in working at the AIDS clinic. There are 20 patients with AIDS-related complex on the waiting list to receive AZT, said Parkland spokeswoman <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. It was not known how soon those patients would be given the drug, which has been shown to prolong the lives of some AIDS victims, she said. Parkland also must begin offering an experimental drug, pentamidine isethionate, to AIDS patients, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ruled.

<TEXT>
 A protective cage like those required on newer buses would not have prevented the fuel tank of a church bus from being punctured in a fiery crash that claimed 27 lives, the state fire marshal says. Fire Marshal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the location of a three-inch gash on the front of the 60-gallon tank and pictures of the metal cages required in newer buses had convinced him that whatever pierced the tank probably would have passed between the bars of a cage. `` In this situation, the way this accident occurred, that cage would have had little or no effect,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. The converted school bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> burst into flames after being hit head-on by a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> on Saturday night. Twenty-seven of the 67 people on board died of smoke inhalation in one of the nation's deadliest bus crashes. The driver, who was allegedly drunk, has been charged with 27 counts of murder. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasone </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team investigating the crash, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s findings could prove true. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> team will continue trying to determine whether a cage would have minimized damage to the fuel tank. Although his report will not be complete for several weeks, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the fuel tank probably was punctured by another piece of the bus. In addition to the gash, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators reported this week that the fuel tank had been pushed back 26 inches and off one of the two straps that fastened it to the bus. A protective cage might have held the tank in place, resulting in an even larger hole, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FBI Nabs Last Two Suspects In $70 Million Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two men arrested by federal agents in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> are the last of seven charged in a failed attempt to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and three of its customers out of nearly $ 70 million, authorities say. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, 49, an attorney, and the Rev. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, 40, were arrested Thursday at their <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> homes and later released on $ 500,000 bond each, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendeloff </PERSON> said the two were to be transported to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after a May 27 hearing before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Narly $ 20 million had not been returned to First National by Thursday. However, officials at the nation's 10th-largest bank insisted that neither the bank nor the three corporate customers whose accounts were involved would lose any money as a result of the sophisticated wire-transfer scheme to transfer money to two Austrian banks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said one Austrian bank, <ORGANIZATION> Creditanstalt </ORGANIZATION>, through <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> correspondent bank, returned the $ 49 million transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> accounts of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. But Focobank of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and its correspondent bank in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, had not returned $ 19.75 million transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> account </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Foreman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based distiller. First National filed a lawsuit Tuesday against <ORGANIZATION> Focobank </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> issued an order freezing <PERSON> Focobank </PERSON>'s account. He also set a May 25 hearing on the matter. Prosecutors said two First National employees provided the schemers with confidential code words and security information, enabling them to transfer the $ 70 million on May 13 to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks, and then into the accounts of the two Austrian banks. On Monday, an executive in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s finance division found a `` substantial overdraft'' in reviewing account transactions from the previous Friday and notified <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, which in turn alerted federal authorities. Four of the other suspects are being held in a federal detention center, while the fifth, a bank employee, is cooperating with authorities and is not being held.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Against Most Currencies, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose against most currencies in quiet European trading early today. Gold prices fell a bit in lackluster trading. Dealers said foreign exchange markets were exceptionally quiet ahead of a three-day weekend for many European countries because of a holiday on Monday. `` It is as dead as a doornail,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. One dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said Tuesday's release of the surprisingly small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for March has lifted the dollar's range a bit but has n't changed the lackluster character of the foreign exchange market. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose fractionally to a closing 124.82 yen from 124.80 yen late Thursday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly higher at 125.09 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's rates: -- 1.7046 West German marks, up from 1.6990 -- 1.4215 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155 -- 5.7725 French francs, up from 5.7542 -- 1.9036 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9042 -- 1,261.80 Italian lire, down from 1,262.00 -- 1.2445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2442 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound It cost $ 1.8635 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8665 late Thursday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 457 a troy ounce, up from late Thursday's $ 456.90. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of $ 456.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 457, down from $ 458 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 45 cents to close at a bid $ 458.01. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.65 a troy ounce, down from late Thursday's $ 6.72.

<HEAD>Seized Research Vessel Likely To be Returned to Owners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A research vessel that was part of the Titanic exploration, seized under the government's `` zero-tolerance'' policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably be returned to its owners, officials say. Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of one of the ship's 25 crew members, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday. Spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said it was clear the 210-foot vessel's owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, `` were innocent parties They've been extremely cooperative in this matter.'' Crew member <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Buzzards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession, said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $ 100. The vessel's owners are forwarding a letter to Customs supporting the anti-drug effort and assuring officials they intend to tighten security aboard the ship, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` Once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the procedures they will take, then we fully intend to return the Atlantis II to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,'' he said. Atlantis II and its contents, including a three-person research submarine named <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON>, are worth $ 80 million, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wednesday from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, where it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological research work near the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, the institution's director of research. The seizure shocked the scientific community at <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, where the ship is based, said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. Construction of Atlantis II and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> was substantially funded by federal research agencies, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. He noted that the 25-foot <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists aboard Atlantis II used <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> in 1986 to explore and photograph the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> site where the Titanic lies. The luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an iceberg only five days into its maiden voyage. More than 1,500 people died. Scientists found the Titanic in September 1985 on a joint U.S.-French expedition. At least 22 vessels have been seized across the country since the zero-tolerance policy went into effect.

 Sikh militants left Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, grenades and ammunition inside the Golden Temple when they surrendered to police following a 10-day siege, a tour of the shrine showed today. Municipal work crews continued to clean debris from the temple complex, and police reported 20 more people shot to death by Sikh extremists overnight. Five of the victims killed Thursday night were Hindu migrant workers who were lined up against a wall and shot. Reporters taken to the temple found that one of its windows had been shattered during the confrontation between the extremists and police. A bullet hole could be seen in the marble near the entrance to the shrine. The weapons were on the floor above the inner sanctum of the temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. The siege ended Wednesday when the last 46 Sikh extremists holed up inside the temple surrendered to police. The Guru <PERSON> Granth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahib </PERSON>, the holy book of the Sikhs, lay covered under a cloth in the inner sanctum on the ground floor. There was a burn mark across the cloth, which appeared to have been made by a bullet passing close to its surface. In rooms around the pool surrounding the temple, reporters were shown the militants' supply of tinned butter, wheat and lentils as well as army uniforms the extremists apparently used to impersonate servicemen in some of their raids. In Room No. 48, the office assigned to the militant <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, reporters saw files of threatening letters that had been sent by the group and other militant factions to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> residents. Some demanded money. In other rooms there were blood-stained clothing, toiletries and medical kits. Police said the migrant workers killed Thursday were lined up against a wall and shot by a gang of eight radicals, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The killings occurred in the village of <PERSON> Chinna </PERSON> <PERSON> Karam </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, about 18 miles northwest of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. It was the second attack on migrant workers this week, suggesting that the estremists were trying to undercut the mainstay of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state's economy, which is agriculture. Overnight Tuesday, Sikh gunmen killed more than 30 Hindu workers from <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> as they slept at a camp near the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. Other deaths reported overnight included six people killed in <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> district, six in <LOCATION> Bhatinda </LOCATION> district and three other shot to death in separate incidents around the state. The killings raised to at least 1,108 the number of people killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the start of the year. In all of 1987, about 1,030 people died. Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where they are a majority. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people and claim they are discriminated against by the nation's majority Hindus State-run <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unidentified government official in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> as saying cleaning was nearly complete at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and `` steps are being taken to restore traditional rituals.'' Police cordoned off the complex May 9 after radicals inside fired on police officers conducting an inspection outside its walls, wounding five of them. Rituals at the golden-domed temple include a continuous reading of the Sikh holy book and the singing of hymns. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Visitors to the inner sanctum of the temple often take a ceremonial dip in the surrounding pool, which is considered sacred.

 Radical students stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound today, hurled six crude homemade bombs and wounded a police officer in the fourth day of clashes between anti-government protesters and police. Students staged demonstrations and marches today at colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities to demand the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Many protests were peaceful, but some turned into battles with police in green combat fatigues and black-visored helmets. `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> imperialists!'' protesters shouted. Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled police around at least three colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and one in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Police fired tear gas and formed walls of shields to stop protesters from marching into the streets. Eight students were arrested today in <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, when they stormed an office of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered the attackers. Students carrying a South Korean flag and banners denouncing the government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scaled the walls of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound and others rushed the gate, police said. They threw six bombs at police guards. One officer was hurt when four of the devices exploded. The officer was hospitalized with wounds, police said. The intruders ran around the embassy compound for several minutes, shouting `` Drive out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>!'' and scattering leaflets before riot police overpowered and arrested seven protesters. Witnesses said some of the protesters got away. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> said one student was injured by a policeman armed with an iron bar, but police said they could not confirm the report. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the bombs did not damage the building and no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel was hurt. Police said the bombs were crude chemical explosives packed in soft drink cans. Radical groups called for a march in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Saturday to denounce the government. Opposition church groups also called for peaceful protests. Police remained on nationwide alert, and riot squads stood guard at key locations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> or waited out of sight in side streets. Protesters have denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in demonstrations this week, charging that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports military dictatorship in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Leaders of the radical students, who represent an important campus minority, want <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to end its alliance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and expel the 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. On Thursday, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The center was seized in February by radicals who exploded several bombs that caused minor damage. Radical groups reject broad democratic reforms made by the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government since it took power in February.

In major clashes in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities, thousands of students and dissidents threw firebombs and rocks at riot police, who used volleys of tear gas to scatter the protesters. The protests this week were called to mark the anniversary of an anti-government uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> on May 18, 1980. Some opposition groups contend <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, as a top general then, played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising, in which at least 191 people were killed. Radicals demand that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> be punished for the incident.

 A man accused of attacking five women was convicted of rape after the victims identified him as their assailant by listening to his tape-recorded voice. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 27, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> factory worker, was found guilty Thursday of 31 charges in a 54-count indictment, including four rapes and one attempted rape. The jury, which deliberated for 10 days, deadlocked on 21 charges, including one rape, an attempted rape and robbery. He was acquitted on two burglary charges. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> displayed no emotion when the verdict was announced. His attorney, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON>, conceded during the six-week trial that one man committed all the crimes but contended that police had arrested the wrong man. He said he would appeal the conviction. In most of the incidents, the assailant wore a mask or it was too dark to see his face, the victims testified. According to Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> stalked his victims for days, confronted them in their bedrooms as they slept and put a screwdriver to their throats. Usually, the victims were blond and attractive, ranging in age from 10 to 55. The attacks at homes on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s affluent <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> began in January 1983 and ended in February 1987, when <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> was arrested. He faces a maximum of 25 years on each rape conviction, and <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON> said he would request the maximum on each count to run consecutively. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Namm </PERSON> set sentencing for June 22. Six victims, four of rape and two of attempted rape, picked <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> from a `` voice lineup'' by listening to recordings of his voice and other male voices and identifying his as that of the man who had attacked them. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Puzo </PERSON>, the author of `` The Godfather,'' also testified that his Bay Shore home was burglarized in 1986 and that several pieces of luggage were stolen. Luggage given to <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s girlfriend was identified by <PERSON> Puzo </PERSON> as belonging to him. <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON> pointed to discrepancies in the descriptions victims gave of their assailant's voice. Some said he spoke with a thick <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accent. At least one recalled the voice of an educated man with no accent. <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON> directed the bulk of his defense against the `` voice lineup,'' calling it prejudicial and flawed.

 A school bus overturned on a sharp curve called `` Devil's Elbow'' and plunged down an embankment in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, injuring 60 people, and another school bus flipped in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, injuring 34 fifth-graders and others Both accidents occurred Thursday afternoon. In the accident about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, the bus went off the curve, fell about 20 feet and landed upside down, police said. The bus, carrying 45 children and 15 adult chaperones from the <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>, was returning from a field trip in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. Sixteen children and eight adults were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Divine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Herz </PERSON> said. An adult passenger and a child were hospitalized in fair condition today, but most of the other injuries were minor. Twenty-nine children and seven adults were treated at two other area hospitals, mostly for bumps, scrapes and bruises, officials said. State police said the driver was unfamiliar with the state road, which he had taken to avoid a traffic tie-up, and said speed may have contributed to the accident. `` He did n't know the turn was there,'' Trooper <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash, 63 people escaped serious injury when their bus overturned on a county road south of <LOCATION> Albion </LOCATION>. Thirty-four passengers were treated at hospitals in <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> for minor lacerations, bruises and fractures, then released, officials said. The bus was carrying 58 students, two parent chaperones, two teachers and a driver from Living History Farms near <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> when it slipped off the pavement onto a muddy shoulder. The bus flipped on its side and skidded about 40 feet before stopping on the edge of an embankment. `` We were turning the corner and the bus driver started yelling and the back tires went off the road. Everybody started hollering and we ran out the back,'' said <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, who said he was sitting six rows from the front. <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> traveled to <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> to calm the youngsters. `` We're taking some of them home in vans because they're afraid to ride the bus,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> today said the party was responsible for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis but criticized what he said were attempts to undermine the party's control of the country In a speech opening the first national party conference in 31 years, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> acknowledged <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s deep economic and social crisis and said party delegates should `` renew and rejuvenate'' the party leadership. The conference delegates will consider changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leadership, including the possible replacement of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 75, made no direct reference to speculation he will relinquish the party leadership he has held since 1956. He mounted a strong attack on reformers who want to see sweeping political and economic change. `` The party condemns independent efforts, even by well-intentioned people, to weaken the party and youth movements,'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> noted, alluding to the formation last week of communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first independent trade union and recent efforts to set up an unofficial democratic youth group. `` The party will not give way to hostile actions challenging the social order,'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> said in his address, which was carried by state-run media. He said the party's task is to create socialism that involves more democracy, but rejected what he called `` efforts to create a bourgeois democracy, or anarchy.'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> addressed the party's failure to straighten out the nation's economic crisis. `` No qualitative changes have taken place in our economy, restructuring is sluggish, and the internal and external financial balance has deteriorated,'' he said. `` As a consequence, conditions are lacking for perceptibly raising the living standard, and even for safeguarding it in all respects. `` Dissatisfaction has increased, and more people are pessimistic about the future and confidence in the party and its leaders has declined,'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> said. Last week, the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said personnel changes would be high on the agenda of the national party conference, fueling speculation <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s era might be coming to a close. Even Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a leading contender for the party chief's post, has suggested that the conference might replace <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. Central Comittee member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that the conference's 990 delegates would have the opportunity `` to create a new leadership if they want to.'' He said a personnel committee would be chosen today to make recommendations for possible changes in the 105-member Central Committee. <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON> said any leadership changes would be announced on Sunday. Without elaborating, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would vote on the post of party leader. <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON> said conference delegates also would discuss `` ways to speed and broaden economic reforms to every segment of the country.'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has been widely criticized for resisting political reforms needed to lift <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economy out of stagnation. `` <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has come to personify the mistakes that have been made in the past,'' said a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` No real change can occur as long as he remains on top.'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> pioneered reforms that made <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> relatively prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s, but a series of recent economic setbacks and austerity measures have angered many Hungarians. Some party members say political reforms <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has proposed, including provisions for secret ballots, limited terms of office for party officials and multi-candidate elections, do not go far enough. A gross foreign debt of more than $ 17 billion and growing inflation led <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leaders this year to impose Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first personal income and value added taxes. Meanwhile, an opposition confederation called on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to end its political monopoly, reinstitute parliamentary rule and freedom of the press and lift state controls on the economy. The recently formed <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiatives </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises environmental, political, youth and other independent groups, released its manifesto Thursday at a news conference.

<TEXT>
 The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> today claimed responsibility for an explosion that ripped through a police recruitment stand at a packed agricultural fair, injuring 14 people. Seven police officers were among those injured in the blast Thursday evening at the <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> Show Grounds, where thousands of people were attending the annual Royal Ulster Agricultural Show. One policeman remained hospitalized today with burns, but the others, including four children, were released after treatment, police said. The explosion set off a fire in the police recruitment stand, sending the crowds fleeing in fear. In a statement to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news media, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion was caused by a 7-pound bomb placed under an office adjacent to the police stand. Initial press reports said police believed the explosion was caused not by a bomb but by a leak in a malfunctioning gas cylinder. But a police spokesman, Inspector <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said police were not ruling out the possibility of a bombing. He said forensic experts were still examining debris. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, the province's mainly Protestant police force, of `` attempting to cover their acute embarrassment -LRB- over not detecting the bomb -RRB- by releasing disinformation to the media'' about the cause of the explosion The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it carried out the attack because the agricultural fair _ the province's biggest such attraction of the year _ `` is one of the jewels in the crown of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s normalization policy and is protected by a massive Crown police force ... `` The province's security forces are the main targets of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in its guerrilla campaign to oust the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
 Cellular telephone companies are enjoying a `` fire sale'' boom because of a blaze at an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> switching center that disrupted phone service for thousands of customers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s western suburbs. `` It's been a hectic time, but we did enjoy some pretty good business out of it,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bellwood </LOCATION>. `` Cellular telephones were a lifesaver for many people ... who were not content to sit dead in the water and had to have some communications.'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> estimated sales have doubled since the May 8 fire that ravaged a key <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>. He said his company could n't have operated without its own cellular phones and portable facsimile machines, which were used to place equipment orders when regular long-distance service was interrupted. An <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said all 35,000 customers in six western suburbs where customers' phones went dead after the fire should have some local phone service by Saturday, but will still have difficulty calling outside their communities. As of Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> workers had restored limited service to 31,000 of the subscribers, said company spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON>. Bell expects that regional and long-distance lines and special business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> center should be functioning almost normally by Saturday, <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, sales manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, said cellular phone sales had tripled to 150 per week and profits had doubled since the fire. His customers included panic-stricken business people as well as fence-sitters who moved up plans to buy cellular portable or car phones. `` We probably did three times the business in a week that we normally do ... and had to add on four workers,'' <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION> said the phone outage boosted an already booming market for cellular phones. `` Sales are better now than they've ever been in the company's four-year history,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> So far, sales over the first two weeks of May in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area have already exceeded the company's forecast for the entire month, she said.

 The government said today that the political situation remains unstable in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> and put two warships on standby near the island nation of to evacuate Australians if necessary. One person was killed and nine injured this week in rioting over land reform in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> tax-haven nation and offshore banking center. The Foreign Ministry advised tourists not to visit <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ordered the warships Stalwart and <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> to extend training exercises in the area and be prepared for a possible evacuation. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> repeated his statement that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was linked to Monday's rioting in the <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION>, but offered no proof. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> denied involvement. News reports said about 750 Australians, residents and visitors, were in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides. The mainly Melanesian island nation of 130,000 people is roughly 1,400 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. Monday's demonstration turned violent when a mob marched on Prime Minister <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>'s office. Demonstrators looted shops and smashed office windows, causing an estimated $ 1 million in damage, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanuatu </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The radio said villagers involved in the demonstration had begun surrendering to police. It gave no details. One demonstrator was killed when a police vehicle ran over him. Police arrested 30 people. Within hours of the trouble, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> flew supplies of riot control gear to <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>'s request. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that there was a possibility of a confrontation this weekend between <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> and the general secretary of his governing Vanu'uka Parti. Australian media reports said the general secretary, <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sope </PERSON>, was behind Monday's demonstration and <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said a number of people around <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> `` have actually been trained in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and that is a matter of concern.'' <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> last year tried unsuccessfully to gain leadership of <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, asserting <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> was unfit for the job after suffering a debilitating stroke. <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> rattled the nerves of generally pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nations with its 1986 decision to establish diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since then, <PERSON> Sope </PERSON>'s supporters have visited <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for what diplomats here described as unspecified training. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted an unidentified Libyan Foreign Minitry official in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> as denying <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>'s charges. <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> was administered jointly by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from 1906 until 1980, when it achieved independence.

 The 9-year-old boy stole the keys to his father's bus and went on a careening joyride through his neighborhood, smashing into cars, a tree and a house as startled residents tried to stop him. The bus finally came to rest in a trailer park. The boy and a 10-year-old friend were treated for minor injuries, but noone else was hurt. `` He took the keys out of his mother's purse and just went for a joyride,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanchett </PERSON>, who works with the boy's mother. The boy's father drives a 23-passenger bus used to transport special education students; the bus was severely damaged in the incident Wednesday. `` I heard tires squealing and saw it coming down the street and it sideswiped my car. It then turned the corner ... on two wheels and disappeared. I tried to get the license plate number, but it was going too fast,'' said <PERSON> Reaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. The bus sideswiped two parked cars. It turned north, then east and hit a pickup truck. Then it crossed a street and ripped limbs from a tree in the front yard of a house. `` I saw it hit the tree so I ran out of the house toward the bus to open its door,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was visiting in the house. `` It backed up and came toward me, so I ran. It then hit the house. His eyes were wide open. He looked scared.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he ran out of his house after watching the bus hit a street sign. `` I ran out and tried to reach in the window to stop the kid, but he started changing gears and sped off,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, adding that the boy locked the doors when another man tried to reach in the window. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said he was painting his house when he saw the bus coming down the street. `` The bus finally came to a stop after he hit the last car. He just let go of the steering wheel and stood up,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. The 10-year-old had been hiding under a seat, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. The two boys then wandered around the bus because they could n't get out of the jammed doors, he said. `` The driver kept saying, ` I ca n't let my mom catch me now,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia said today that it blocked an attempt by the rival pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to swap a foreign hostage for weapons and ammunition from Christian militias. `` Amal has thwarted an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to turn over a foreign hostage to the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Lebanese Forces -LRB- militia -RRB- in return for ammunition and weapons for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s besieged base in <LOCATION> Hajjaj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Atif </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s politburo. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told about 10,000 supporters of the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia in the southern town of <LOCATION> Zahrani </LOCATION> that Amal foiled the alleged swap `` after we found out about the contacts between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Lebanese Forces.'' He did not elaborate. Groups affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, are believed to hold most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not say whether one particular hostage or nationality was involved in the alleged deal. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s base is in <LOCATION> Hajjaj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district. Positions of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia are in the district of <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rummaneh </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Hajjaj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. The two districts have been separated by a 25-yard-deep no-man's - land since the Lebanese civil war broke out There was no way to verify the report independently, and neither the Lebanese Forces nor <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> had any immediate comment. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> made the charge as <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for hope, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> battled for a 15th day in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where the Western hostages are believed held. Syrian forces, massed around the disputed area since Saturday, were threatening to move in and stop the fighting. A representative of a Seattle-based human rights group arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to try to meet with a Shiite Moslem religious leader and deliver a petition that calls for the release of foreign hostages. In addition, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, arrived in the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> today to try to secure the release of the American hostages. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, speaking to reporters Thursday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> mission was prompted by concerns about the hostages' safety in the face of the intense <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighting He refused to elaborate. Police said seven people were killed and 38 wounded in today's exchanges That raises the toll to at least 251 people killed and 810 wounded since May 6, when the battles broke out. On Thursday, <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who is also <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister, announced a sweeping purge of the militia's military <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> fired the militia's top military commander, <PERSON> Akel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamieh </PERSON>, and five senior aides. The statement did not give a reason. However, a ranking Amal official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the six were fired for `` conspiring with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks on the southern, western and northern edges of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> over the weekend after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> seized about 90 precent of the enclave from Amal. Syrian officers have said they were delaying a decision to move into south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> until diplomatic efforts have been exhausted. Clashes persisted despite efforts by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, to arrange a truce. <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> on Thursday softened his earlier opposition to Syrian military intervention. `` If the entry of the Syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees security, we will not object,'' <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s principal Arab ally in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Physicians Got Kickbacks in Medicare Fraud Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 1,000 physicans in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> received kickbacks as part of a <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> fraud scheme involving a medical laboratory company, say federal officials. It is believed to be the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> fraud case in terms of the number of doctors involved, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. The 987 doctors were paid a $ 50 kickback by <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for each patient referred to the company for a blood circulation test, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has mailed letters to 382 of the doctors over the last two days requesting they pay the government three times the amount they allegedly received in order to avoid civil action and expulsion from the Medicare program, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. The 382 doctors received a total of $ 200,000 in fees, or an average of about $ 523. Most of them were calling to offer to settle the claims, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Many of the remaining doctors received less than $ 150 and are not expected to be pursued in the case, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported today, citing unidentified federal sources. Fewer than 100 physicians received more than $ 5,000 apiece in fees and are expected to be prosecuted individually, the newspaper said. Medical Diagnostic Services billed Medicare $ 400 to $ 1,000 per patient, contending that it had performed a sophisticated test when in fact it had conducted only a simple, routine test, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` This is a classic Medicare rip-off,'' one investigator familiar with the case, which is being investigated by the Inspector General's Office of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, told the Inquirer. Between August 1982 and February 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, operating under four different corporate names in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, billed Medicare for about $ 4.5 million, the newspaper said. In July 1987, the owners of <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, each pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud in defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> system and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's that time of year when the networks announce their fall schedules, and <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is right in there with the big guys a year after it first started offering original, prime-time programming. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s president for programming, <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancier </PERSON>, announced Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> will expand its weekend programming to Monday in the spring of 1989 with a `` Fox Movie of the Week.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ancier </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has renewed its `` very successful'' Sunday night lineup of `` 21 Jump Street,'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' `` Married ... With Children,'' `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show,'' `` Duet'' and `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show. Saturday will be all new in the fall, depending on the end of the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, with a new show from producer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, `` City Court,'' which will follow cases from `` 21 Jump Street'' through the court system, and `` Angels'88,'' a kind of `` Charlie's Angels'' descendant from <ORGANIZATION> Aaron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spelling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>. Until `` Angels'' premieres later this year, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> will fill in on Saturdays beginning this summer with a newsmagazine, `` Page One.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> canceled `` Werewolf'' and `` Boys Will Be Boys.'' `` The Dirty Dozen'' is not on the fall schedule, but has not been canceled and might be brought back after its run this summer. `` Family Double Dare'' is not on the schedule, but has n't exactly been canceled yet. Like the big three networks, the start of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s fall season could be delayed because of the strike. The Monday movie night will be delayed until 1989 because of uncertainty about the strike, but <PERSON> Ancier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has obtained such theatrical releases as `` Predator,'' `` Black Widow'' and `` The Fly'' that can be shown in the time period until original programming is ready. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, owned by media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, made its debut in October 1986 with the ill-fated `` The Late Show'' starring <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>. The weekend prime-time schedule was added in April 1987. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has about 100 affiliated stations, less than half the number the big three networks have. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows started out with ratings in the twos and threes. But `` Married ... With Children,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s highest-rated show last week, had a 6.0, below the lowest-rated network show, which last week was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Supercarrier,'' with a 6.3 The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes with television. <PERSON> Ancier </PERSON> predicted that the Sunday lineup will improve by a rating point in the coming season, but withheld predictions on the rest of the lineup. Here is <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s projected schedule: Fall 1988: Saturday _ `` City Court,'' `` Angels'88.'' Sunday _ `` 21 Jump Street,'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' `` Married ... With Children,'' `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show,'' `` Duet,'' `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show.'' Spring 1989: Monday _ `` Fox Movie of the Week.''

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser, took archaeological artifacts out of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without a required government permit. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON>, head of the archeological robbery prevention section at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION>, said on Thursday that <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> bought the artifacts from an underground dealer and took them out of the country without a special permit required from the Israeli agency. The Education Ministry said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> was being investigated but did not give further details. A senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators would contact <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> but as far as he knew, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official would not be prosecuted. `` What is clear to us is that <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> violated the law,'' <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday night that the Israeli government was not pursuing any investigation. Spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has announced `` there is nothing to the allegation which warrants any action.'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> could not be reached for comment, a secretary in his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office said. <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON> said his department would view the return of the artifacts as the end of the incident. The Israeli newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified aide to <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official purchased arifacts only from licensed dealers and was willing to return any artifacts found to have been removed illegally. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> recently to help settle an Israeli-Egyptian border dispute. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Matnai </PERSON>, minister-counselor for political affairs at the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the investigation was over and that the matter `` was blown out of proportion.

One of those under investigation claimed he sold coins and other artifacts to <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dahari </PERSON> said.

 Demonstrators today smashed five police cars and ripped down the plaque of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s legislature in clashes with authorities, police said. More than 40 people were reported injured. About 3,000 protesters demanding government assistance for farmers chanted slogans and marched through <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> streets before the battles, which marked the worst protest violence since the government eased restrictions on demonstrations last year. Farmers from central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hurled rocks and clubs at 200 riot police who blocked the entrance to the Legislative Yuan. After police dragged three protesters inside, demonstrators stormed the police lines, broke several windows and tore down the `` Legislative Yuan'' plaque on the building, the home of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body Police beat back the protesters with clubs and rocks and dispersed the crowd with water cannons. But it regrouped and marched to the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to demand the release of the three protesters. Police blocked the way to the party office with barbed-wired barricades. More clashes were reported outside the party headquarters and a police station. Protest leaders reported at least 10 protesters were injured, while police said about 20 officers and 12 reporters were hurt, including six people who were hospitalized. Ten demonstrators were arrested, police said. The violence halted traffic on the main streets of downtown <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> for several hours. Protesters said the government has helped industry but has ignored farmers, who have suffered because of low crop prices. One protest banner read: `` Our president holds a doctoral degree in agriculture, but farmers are suffering.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported today that President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, an expert in agricultural economics, has instructed officials to stress the administration is determined to take care of farmers.

<TEXT>
 An Iranian leader today reiterated statements that his nation is at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and called for an arms buildup to confront <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The Americans have officially entered into a war with us,'' said parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. `` We are really at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the present time.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, quoted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, made the remarks during a meeting with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The agency was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Later in the day, he told Moslem prayer worshipers that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fought <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` they must wait to receive lots of their youths' dead bodies.'' It was not the first time Iranian leaders have made such statements. They have said before that their country is at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially after American military strikes against Iranian offshore platforms in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is close to Iranian revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, also repeated previous accusations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participated in a recent Iraqi attack on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Larak island oil terminal. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships guided Iraqi forces and caused trouble for our defensive forces,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been `` active in providing financial and propaganda support for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since the beginning of the war and is itself responsible for this crime -LRB- the war -RRB-.'' He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was no longer just at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but also `` with global arrogance,'' a common reference to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We, too, should increase our military strength ... in order to take more effective and important steps on the war fronts,'' he said. On April 18, a statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which determines <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war strategy, called on all Iranians to fight the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the same day a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to expect a severe response from the people of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, alleging that American military helicopters fought on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recapture of the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In October 1987, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajaie-Khorassani </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` We think we are at war. We think we are being killed by the Americans.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also complained today that some women in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were not covering their bodies sufficiently and blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He appeared to be saying that women were not wearing the head-to-toe covering called the chador. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is ... influencing women not to cover themselves the way they should according to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` But women who commit such crimes must beware that our nation will not tolerate them.'' He did not spell out what punishment might await them, but last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved a law under which people who offend `` public morals'' will receive 74 lashes of the whip. The offenses were not spelled out. Under <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic government, even husbands and wives are forbidden to kiss or show physical affection in public and this is the kind of action usually referred to as offending public morality. In 1963, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> organized riots against <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>'s plan to give new rights to women. He and other clergymen who are now top Iranian leaders have consistently opposed Western-style rights for women.

 The prosecutor responsible for convicting reputed cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> says the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>'s days are now numbered, while a defense lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities say the 38-year-old Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent drug ring responsible for about 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cocaine imports. The jury reconvened this morning today to decide whether <PERSON> Ledher </PERSON> should forfeit his millions of dollars worth of real estate on <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The flamboyant <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, described by witnesses as a one-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street hood, was characterized by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important drug smuggler brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to smuggle cocaine into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. `` In the immortal words of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, ` I feel good,''' said a jubilant <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. `` This is truly a major victory in the war on drugs,'' he added, saying the verdict would put a crimp in the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>'s operations. `` I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' he said. `` I think their days are numbered.'' However, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narcotics committee, said the conviction will by no means solve this country's drug problem. `` <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is not the end of the kingpins of the cartel,'' he said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, who presented no witnesses on <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s behalf, said, `` We are of the view that Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> will be vindicated on appeal and that he will receive a new trial ... based only on the charges in the indictment.'' The trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year after a firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mansion. When the verdicts were read, he looked down briefly, then stared straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into her hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s aunt in the audience also cried and slumped on a bench. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of life plus 150 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging from possession of cocaine to running a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said he will recommend life in prison. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s co-defendant, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 15-year sentence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for July 20. According to <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures, the drug kingpin earned an estimated $ 250 million in the cocaine business. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> the `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of the cocaine trade,'' the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern, high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats. Prosecutors and government witnesses described <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as an admirer of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> who put together a vast cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Attorney General <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said, `` Everyone in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He declined further comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called it `` an excellent example of international cooperation ... against a major drug trafficker.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as a legitimate businessman victimized by drug investigators, accused the government of creating hysteria, convincing jurors their own security was threatened. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> `` did not, in my opinion, get a fair trial to which he was entitled,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the conviction sends a message to other cartel officials that `` you are not able to bribe, intimidate or murder your way out of custody in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Hook called the cartel the world's largest drug trafficking ring. By comparison, authorities say the French Connection drug ring smuggled in about 70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971. The principal prosecution witness was <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an ex-marine pilot who ran his own marijuana smuggling operation from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay He teamed up with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, but eventually fell out with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, he said. After his arrest in 1981, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> began cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. He is under federal protection and has been given a new identity. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> allegedly paid Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the small island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, a short hop from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, himself reportedly a target of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand jury investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the allegations a `` fairy tale.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> has been blamed for a wave of violence across <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, including the assassination of a former justice minister and the slaying of a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DEA informant. The trial was conducted under heavy security.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> plan to agree at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit on a program of notification of each others' ballistic missile tests The agreement was to have been a minor part of an overall plan the superpowers had hoped to reach reducing strategic, or long-range, nuclear forces by up to 50 percent _ a so-called START pact. Though the two sides have failed to reach that sweeping agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, they have developed `` similar language'' on missile-testing notification _ a program designed to boost confidence that tests are not a prelude to war. `` It's something that conceivably could be lifted out of that -LRB- the START agreement -RRB- and signed separately and it would not be a big deal, but an additional confidence-building measure,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a satellite news conference with reporters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In addition, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are likely to issue a statement outlining other areas of progress they have made toward the unrealized START agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a Soviet spokesman said in an interview published today that the two sides will include land-based mobile missiles in their negotiations on a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons. `` We have every reason to believe that the problem of mobile missiles will be resolved,'' Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are now coordinating positions on this in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>,'' where U.S.-Soviet arms talks are under way, <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appeared to be moving away from its demand for a ban on such missiles now that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to base MX missiles on railroad cars. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said that there had been no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy but that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it is willing to negotiate on ways to verify an agreement which would allow both sides to deploy mobile missiles. The official was not named. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rejected Soviet proposals to include mobile missiles in a START accord because of verification problems. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have presented ideas in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on how to verify limits on mobile missiles after earlier seeking a ban on such weapons when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thought its MX missile would be based in fixed silos and the Soviets were developing mobile weapons. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> acknowledged that an agreement on reducing strategic weapons could not be reached in time for the U.S.-Soviet summit that begins May 29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, as originally had been hoped. However, he said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would continue to negotiate in hopes of reaching an accord before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends. `` The problem now is to establish ourselves so we do not go back from the points we have already reached,'' he said. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> also said differences over sea-launched cruise missiles could not be set aside temporarily or solved through unilateral declarations, as has been formally suggested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He said the other major sticking point on a strategic arms reduction treaty was disagreement over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, also known as Star Wars.

 The Democratic Party's national chairman blasted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today as a do-nothing vice president and a `` quintessential elitist establishment Republican country-clubber.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself sought black support by meeting with civil rights leaders. Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and rival candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were both campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the Democrats will have their convention in July, the chairman of the party's national committee, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a gloves-off speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chairs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been `` applauding in the dark shadows of this Republican administration as it turns thumbs down on public ethics, thumbs down on the Civil Rights Restoration Act, thumbs down on a simple 60-days notice to working men and women who are about to lose their jobs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Democratic official said, is `` a quintessential elitist establishment Republican country-clubber, with no connection to ethnic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to minority <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to working-class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has neither the toughness to govern nor the compassion to care.'' With its prize of 314 delegates, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest on June 7 overshadows the three other primaries the same day _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which among them offer a total of 152 Democratic delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to clinch the delegates needed to nominate with that final round of primaries. According to the latest AP delegate count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 1,645 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 974, of the 2,081 needed to nominate. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has little chance of overtaking the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor now, he would like to make <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> a staging ground for a final show of strength before the convention. At a high school in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Thursday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke of `` the sense of hope, the celebration of people coming together because we care.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Thursday night for two days of campaigning in the state, faced hecklers at his first stop, a rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,'' the hecklers shouted. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor did talk about AIDS, though, calling it `` a disease that must be conquered.'' Earlier this month, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a stormy meeting with gay activists in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, facing hostile questions about his opposition to allowing homosexual couples to be foster parents. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, described his meeting with about 20 civil rights leaders Thursday night as a `` very good session.'' But two participants who spoke with reporters afterward suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to work hard to overcome his association with the administration's civil rights record. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record on civil rights is not a record that anybody can defend,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this point, I would say the vice president has a long way to go if he actually expects to get a substantial black vote.'' `` I came with a great deal of hope that we'd find in Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a new level of sensitivity to the devastation in the black community that's escalated and intensified over the past seven years,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` That hope has not been fulfilled.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said he hoped to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` out there fighting for the black vote.'' Putting some distance between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is becoming a key part of the vice president's campaign strategy. The remaining primaries are something of an afterthought for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already has the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination wrapped up. But a series of recent polls have suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is losing ground against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee. The vice president acknowledges that controversies over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration actions _ such as dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ have probably hurt him. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on drug trafficking charges, but the administration is said to be ready to drop the charges in order to get him to step aside. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been edging away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> affair, although he is carefully avoiding any criticism of his boss. The White House, in turn, is going out of its way to publicly give the vice president free rein. `` As we go through the campaign, I would expect to see the vice president speaking out on a number of issues,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I expect a number of them will be different than existing policies and ... we will not criticize them ... in any way.'' The White House reassurance followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement this week that he would not `` bargain with drug dealers.'' Aides said the message was that as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not make a deal with someone like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting sources, said in today's editions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a high-level meeting, had urged an end to negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Thursday night he had no knowledge of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommendations concerning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comment about not bargaining with drug dealers had only a limited application. `` I think that he was making ... plain that you do n't negotiate with people of that kind with regard to their activity in drugs,'' the president told foreign broadcast journalists in an interview Thursday.

<HEAD>Art Thieves Steal Three Masterpieces From Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `Stolen were...' to CORRECT date of
Carnations.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Thieves smashed a window at the Municipal Museum today and made off with three 19th-century paintings worth up to $ 52 million, including works by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>. Museum officials said it was the largest art theft in modern Dutch history. Stolen were `` Carnations,'' an 1888 work by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>; `` The House of <LOCATION> Maitre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Billaud </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION>,'' by Dutch painter <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON>, from 1874; and `` Bottle with Apples,'' an 1894 still life by <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, the French impressionist. Museum director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> estimated their combined value at $ 52 million, but the <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction firm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> set their worth at $ 11 million. The theft at the downtown museum, also known as the <ORGANIZATION> Stedelijk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, was discovered after 5 a.m. when someone broke a window in the building and triggered an alarm. Museum spokesman <PERSON> Maarten </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertheux </PERSON> said no one was inside at the time. He said the museum's estimated 3,000 works are protected only by an electronic alarm system when the museum is closed. Round-the-clock surveillance by security personnel was abolished as an economy measure in 1975, <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said. `` This is a terrible loss of prestige for -LRB- museum -RRB- security,'' he told reporters. The stolen paintings were not insured. The museum, famed for its collection of works by 19th - and 20th-century masters, is a three-story building with large windows on the street level The thieves entered through one of those windows that faces a secluded, tree-shrouded area, officials said. They walked through five galleries before reaching the room where the stolen paintings were on display with two other <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> works, according to deputy director <PERSON> Rini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON> speculated that the thieves left the other two <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings, `` The Rocking Chair'' and `` The Diggers,'' because they were substantially larger than `` Carnations,'' which measures 18.4 by 15 inches. There were conflicting accounts on how the theft was discovered. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Heleen </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weijden </PERSON> police arrived on the scene after the alarm sounded and entered the museum but failed to notice the theft. She said the theft was discovered an hour later by a private security guard. <PERSON> Bertheux </PERSON> said museum staffers and police discovered the theft about 20 minutes after the alarm sounded. Recent tests of the alarm system showed it took only three minutes for police and guards to get there, <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said. He could give no explanation for the delay. Mrs. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Weijden </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> and customs services around the world were alerted. The Municipal Museum is next to the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gogh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which has the world's largest collection by the Dutch master. About 200 yards from the two museums is the Rijksmuseum, the nation's largest repository of works by <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the stolen <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> is worth $ 1.6 million to $ 2.1 million; the <ORGANIZATION> Cezanne </ORGANIZATION>, $ 7.9 million; and the Jongkind, $ 147,000. Ms. <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON> said those estimates were based on black and white photographs in a museum catalog. <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said he based his higher estimate on the fact that `` there is a <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> involved, and recent price developments -LRB- for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON> -RRB- have been dramatic.'' In March 1987, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' drew $ 39.8 million at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid $ 53 million for the Dutch painter's `` Irises'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> speculated that the theft may have been commissioned by a private art collector, since the paintings are too famous to be sold on the public market. `` I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a clear purpose in mind,'' he said. `` This'll go straight to somebody's room or home, I guess.''

The elder <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> was out of town. <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> said there will be a search to replace <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>.

 A sculptor says that opponents of a proposed statue in memory of 20 men and women executed 300 years ago as witches are just trying to foreget what happened. <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON> is trying to give the city a 14-foot-high bronze to commemorate the witches, but some residents say greed is behind the seven-ton sculpture they say will be a tourist attraction. Supporters say the critics want to forget what happened in 1692 and the sculpture is a public apology to the 20 people executed then. `` People like them are the same people who 300 years ago caused the death of these 20 people. They are still doing it today. It's an injustice,'' <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> in a story published today <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON>, who said he supports himself by making wax molds for a chocolate company, was inspired to create the statue three years ago by `` Three Sovereigns for <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>,'' a film about the <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> witchcraft trials. He said he raised $ 2,500 in private financing and also got donations of transportation and a rent-free studio. He said he hoped to present his work to the city as a gift. `` Most people want to forget about what happened in 1692,'' he said. `` Three hundred years have gone by, and they have done nothing to commemorate those victims. I decide to step in and make a statue, and now they form a committee.'' The Salem Witchcraft Tercentenary Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opposes the statue and is planning an official memorial, said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Szala </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, who heads the committee. He said the committee believes planting trees or putting the names of the 20 victims on plaques with an eternal flame would be more appropriate. And, he said <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON> is an outsider who has ignored local opinion and is `` using a tragic event to make a dollar.'' `` No one knows how much it cost,'' <PERSON> Szala </PERSON> said. `` To whom does this man answer?

 A fire that began in the chief's office at police headquarters forced the evacuation of the department and the city jail, disrupted police communications and injured 10 people. The fire Thursday night caused an estimated $ 1.2 million damage to the eight-story downtown building, officials said. The blaze began in Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>'s fifth-floor office as workers remodeling the office were spraying lacquer on the walls, Fire Capt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Galetti </PERSON> said today. The workmen tried to battle the flames with fire hoses and extinguishers, then called for help. The blaze was brought under control in about 90 minutes, <PERSON> Galetti </PERSON> said. About 115 people were evacuated fifteen minutes after the fire started, including 39 prisoners held in the eighth-floor temporary holding jail. The prisoners were led down nine flights of stairs to the basement, then transferred to holding cells in the nearby Municipal Courts building and the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. The fire caused disruption in police communications system and in telephone calls to headquarters. Calls that could n't be handled by headquarters were automatically routed to other police and fire stations. Those taken to hospitals included one prisoner, four firefighters and four police department employees, all treated for smoke inhalation, and one police employee who had a minor shoulder injury. Many other people were treated at the scene.

 A tribal chief who witnessed the arrival of some of the first white settlers a century ago has died at age 109, it was reported Friday. Chief <PERSON> Wavela </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazetese </PERSON>, from the <LOCATION> Mwenezi </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> province in western <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, died in his village Sunday after a short illness, the state-owned Chronicle newspaper said. Mazetese, in a 1984 newspaper interview, said he was a boy tending his father's cattle when the first whites he had seen appeared on horses and in wagons led by oxen. Historians said the whites were probably among the first settlers to arrive in the former British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> in the 1890s. The colony won its independence as a black-governed nation in 1980 following a guerrilla war. It was renamed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, after an ancient gold-rich African kingdom. Mazetese is survived by a wife and 20 children.

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of seals in Danish waters are dying of pneumonia, and the mysterious epidemic could spread to marine mammals in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, a biologist said Friday. More than 200 harp seals are known to have died in recent weeks on the island of <PERSON> Anholt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kattegat </LOCATION> strait between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, said biologist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON>. He said the area's entire 1988 generation of seals was lost because their sick mothers aborted. Dying or dead seals also have been found beached on the islands of <LOCATION> Laesoe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hesseloe </PERSON> and as far south as the port city of <LOCATION> Helsingoer </LOCATION>, giving rise to fears that the infection might spead, he said. He said the virus spreads by direct contact between adult seals as they lie close together on land, adding that it resembles an influenza that struck hundreds of seals on the Canadian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> eastern coasts in 1980. Another expert, <PERSON> Knud </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said he suspected a herpes-like virus similar to one blamed for seal deaths of seals off <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> a few years ago. Experts from several government agencies met in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> to discuss the crisis. They agreed that more seals will die in the next few months as the epidemic spreads. The harp seal was near extinction in 1975, when it was declared a protected species. An estimated 5,000 of the mammals inhabit Danish waters, breeding 500 to 1,000 pups a year.

 Two Kuwaiti men killed when their bomb-laden car blew up before reaching its intended target were pious Moslems who were duped by criminals, it was reported Friday. The newspaper Al-Qabas also said that fighting terrorism should include `` immunizing citizens against falling easy prey to protagonists of crime and deepening sentiments of patriotism with the youth.'' The paper warned that more terrrorism should be expected. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the two men were planning to park the car in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> building in downtown <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but the explosives apparently went off prematurely. The blast was the third in this northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> country in less than a month. In December 1983, a car bomb exploded at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies, and in 1985, an attempt was made on the life of the emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. Last month, a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was hijacked for 16 days and two Kuwaitis aboard were killed by the gunmen, who have been described as pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists. `` We have to shoulder our historic responsibility ... because confining our attitude to condemation of crimes and counting casualties will be without avail if we want our country to live in peace and security,'' <PERSON> Al-Qabas </PERSON> said. The two young <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON>, who have been identified as <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Mousa </PERSON>, 23, were killed when the car they were traveling in exploded near the airline's head office. Al-Qabas quoted a sister of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> as saying that her family was surprised to learn about the incident. She described her brother as `` a fervent Moslem who strictly performs his religious obligations and leads a normal life. We did not discern anything abnormal in his day-to-day behavior.'' She said he was a teacher at an elementary school, unmarried and owned the car that exploded. Her family did not know the companion killed with him, she said. Al-Qabas said <PERSON> Al-Mousa </PERSON> was a geography student at <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and was married with no children. The paper quoted <PERSON> Al-Mousa </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON>, as saying his brother was `` a very committed Moslem.''

<DATELINE>NARITA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years after its opening, <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is still surrounded by barbed wire and riot police _ bitter reminders of the often violent war between disaffected farmers and the government. Now an ambitious expansion plan threatens to bring more trouble. Since its conception 22 years ago, farmers and demonstrators have clashed ferociously with riot police over plans to expropriate vast amounts of fertile farmland and polish it into a gleaming international gateway. Today, the sprawling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, located 40 miles from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, resembles a beseiged city, patrolled day and night by 700 policeman. Departing passengers and guests are frisked with metal detectors at several security checkpoints and at times required to produce identification when entering the airport grounds. Six lives have been lost in bloody battles since the 1966 government decision designated <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> as the site for a new airport. But <PERSON> Koji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitahara </PERSON>, leader of a group of airport opponents, claims the figures mean nothing. `` More lives will be taken in the fight,'' he vows. Together with the Chukaku-ha, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest radical group, anti-Narita protesters have sabotaged construction work and even managed several times to delay the airport inauguration, originally scheduled for March 1971. In one such clash, a handful of leftists crept into <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>'s 16th-floor control tower through a sewer tunnel and destroyed its radar, weather and communications equipment Outside, about 6,000 demonstrators fought pitched battles with 13,000 policemen. The sabotage pushed back the opening for another two months and it was not until May 20, 1978, that the first flight took off from the heavily guarded <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>. `` For 22 years we have fought the government for disrupting our lives and taking away our right to a normal livelihood,'' said <PERSON> Kitahara </PERSON>, 66. `` If we allow the completion of the second-phase construction project, we will have no future,'' he said in an interview at his home 500 yards from <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>'s only runway. Overhead, a jet roared by. <PERSON> Kitahara </PERSON>, who has been arrested three times in his fight against the airport, said many of the displaced farmers have been reduced to working as day laborers on construction sites. Some wives have taken up part-time jobs and `` a few of the men even work as guards at the airport'' to make ends meet, he added. `` But many of them come to me now and say they wished they never sold their land,'' <PERSON> Kitahara </PERSON> said. `` They're no longer their own boss. They have to take orders from someone else.'' Government plans call for <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> to be doubled in size by March 1991 with the construction of two runways measuring 8,250 feet and 10,560 feet, and a second terminal building to increase the current capacity of 11 million passengers annually to 23 million. But like the first stage, construction for the expansion has encountered strong opposition and plans originally targeted for completion in 1974 have only reached the ground-breaking stage. A protest rally has been scheduled for Sunday. According to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, eight families are thwarting the expansion by refusing to give up 52.6-acres of farmland. `` We hope to come to terms with them through talks,'' said <PERSON> Masataka </PERSON> <PERSON> Takemoto </PERSON>, chief of public relations at the airport authority office. He said about 325 families have been resettled in nearby farmlands since 1966 after agreeing to cede their properties. <PERSON> Takemoto </PERSON> claims about 200 members of the Marxist Chukaku-ha, or <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Core </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, live around the airport and are threatening to harm the farmers if they sell their land. They maintain the airport may be used for military purposes. `` Even if the farmers want to sell, they ca n't because of fear of what the Chukaku-ha will do,'' he said. Known for violent tactics and using homemade projectiles and flamethrowers, the radical group has spearheaded the anti-Narita movement. It was blamed for forcing the temporary closure of <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> for one hour in 1985 after firebombs were hurled on the runway. `` The group has taken up the matter as just another way of rebelling against the government,'' said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamo </PERSON>, deputy chief of public relations of the airport authority. `` As soon as they find some other anti-government cause to support, they'll latch onto it. Despite the protests, initial work on the second runway has begun, tightly cordoned off by coils of barbed wire and guarded closely by riot police. Should the farmers refuse to sell their holdings, <PERSON> Takemoto </PERSON> added, `` we will take the land through legal means.'' `` We will finish the airport,'' <PERSON> Takemoto </PERSON> said. `` As a major power in the world, we have an obligation to complete the construction.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today overwhelmingly rejected an attempt by conservative critics of the U.S.-Soviet missile treaty to link the pact to alleged Soviet cheating on five other arms-control agreements. In a series of five votes, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> killed, piece by piece, the amendment proposed by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho. <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>' amendment noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the Soviets are violating the SALT I and SALT II arms-limitation treaties, a 1963 pact banning open-air atomic tests, a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol banning chemical weapons and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. His proposal would have required that the administration certify the Soviets are in compliance with all these pacts before the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty could have taken effect. Conservatives, using <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, insisted on five separate votes rather than a single roll call. In the tallies, the votes to kill <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>' proposal were 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8. The decision came after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> called on his fellow Republicans to speed up the action. `` We need to start making real progress on the treaty itself,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Time is of the essence; the president leaves next Wednesday'' for his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Republican senators have `` a special burden'' to assure that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> without ratification of the INF treaty. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> observer term which monitored the INF talks, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, `` As one of them, I can stand before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and say I have confidence in this treaty, it need not be changed at all.'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said his amendments `` simply mean that the treaty does not go into effect until the president can report the Soviets are in compliance with existing arms treaties.'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., opposed the <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> proposal because he said `` it is designed to kill the INF treaty, not to produce Soviet compliance Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., complaining of Republican stalling, referred to <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>' proposal as `` nonsense and extraneous. `` I think this is a terrible situation,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. `` It would cripple the president as he represents the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the free world.'''' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be partly to blame if the treaty is n't approved before the summit `` The president could put his foot down. He is the president. He is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> without question. I think he is contributing to his own problems.'' As debate on the amendments opened Thursday, <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expect they're going to cheat in the future.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says this treaty should be considered on its own merits. `` To my mind, the important thing is what does this treaty do; does it help our security or harm it?'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't think we ought to be in the position of cutting off our nose to spite our face.'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty `` stands on its own merits ... It's nonsensical to tie this to other treaties.'' The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, calls for the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` deserves an opportunity for this body _ before he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ to say yes or no'' to the pact. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want this treaty ratified and they want this president to have the opportunity to maximize what may flow from it.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said he would be surprised if more than 10 of the 100 senators vote against the pact. Ratification requires 67 votes and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>'s estimate is similar to forecasts by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties. But the opponents could delay the final vote with parliamentary maneuvers and by introducing numerous amendments. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, leader of the opponents, objected Thursday when Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, sought approval to move from consideration of the treaty itself to the separate resolution of Under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, designed to protect the rights of the minority, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' objection meant that the chamber could n't move to the resolution. Both the treaty and the resolution will be considered in separate votes. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he objected because three other senators, whom he did not name, planned to offer amendments to the text of the treaty. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., another critic of the pact, responded to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s plea by saying, `` For us to be hurried to suit the climate of a summit is just a wrong urging at this moment.

As the most senior member of the Twelve, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was next in line to become president of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. However, because of his advanced age and failing health, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> had not been active in church leadership for several years. Church President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> recently appointed the next-most-senior apostle, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, as acting president of the Twelve. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was one of the architects of the church's extensive welfare system, which was created in 1936. He was called to general leadership in the church in April 1941 as an assistant to the Council of the Twelve. He was named in October 1951 to the Twelve, which helps the governing three-member First Presidency, and became a member of the First Presidency in 1972. During his career <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> supervised missionary efforts of the church in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In 1961, he formally organized in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the church's first Spanish-speaking stake, a geographical unit comprised of several congregations. The welfare system he helped develop is based on a philosophy of self-sufficiency and consists of a network of farms, bakeries and canneries that provide jobs and goods for church members in need. Recipients are required to work at one of the welfare enterprises or perform some other service in return for assistance. He shunned public attention and was known for his self-deprecating wit. When responding to his appointment as an apostle in 1951, the small-statured <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> said: `` This call has set up a tremendous emotional reaction in me. I did n't think there could be such a big tempest in such a little teapot.'' <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was a counselor to the late church presidents <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> between 1972 to 1985.

His father had left him in charge of getting the family to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but as the boy steered the horses and wagon down the road, members of the rebel army stopped them and took their total savings of 20 pesos. `` Then they turned around, drew their guns, and I looked down the barrels of rifles that seemed very large to me,'' he said. `` I expected them to shoot, but for some reason they did not and I have lived to tell the story.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet bound for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> made an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> last week after a leak began spewing fuel into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, officials said today.

The spokesman said he did n't know how much fuel was left on landing and added that authorities have not yet determined the cause of the split.

 Maple syrup production was up by 225,000 gallons this year, but producers did n't have the banner year they had been hoping for this spring. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state produced 805,000 gallons in 1988, with a gallon of syrup costing an average $ 34.72 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and $ 25 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> again led the nation in production, with 370,000 gallons. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> followed with 310,000 gallons, while <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> produced 74,000 gallons, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> produced 44,000 gallons and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> produced 7,000 gallons.

<HEAD>Remains of 14th Century Royal Palace Found In London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists have unearthed the 14th century remains of King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s palace where he relaxed with his homosexual lover before being deposed by his wife and murdered, as tradition has it, with a red hot poker. The archaeologists have also found on the same <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> site the remains of a house owned by Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fastolf </PERSON>, thought to have been the model for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Falstaff </PERSON>. Falstaff, the hard-drinking, knight-turned-robber, is one of the great comic creations of English literature. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Museum hailed the find of enormous historical importance but a member of its archaeological team, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerson </PERSON>, said that under terms of an agreement with a construction company, the museum must halt its work sometime this fall. After that, bulldozers will move in to clear the site. `` The most important thing now is to record the exact details before the site is destroyed,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hammerson </ORGANIZATION> said that the developers, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had sponsored the archaeological work. The remains of the palace and <PERSON> Fastolf </PERSON>'s house were discovered on a construction site at <LOCATION> Hayes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wharf </LOCATION> on the south bank of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> where <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s wants to build offices and apartments. A large stone corner of the palace was unearthed last week but the archaeologists tried to keep the find quiet for fear of attracting treasure hunters, said the <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> which reported the find Friday. The Times said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s is also wary of publicity because its development plan is already the subject of an official public inquiry to decide whether or not it should go ahead. The palace was a large moated building covering about 80 square yards. Known to historians as the `` Rosary,'' it was a retreat on the far side of the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> where the king could escape the cares of office. The paper quoted historian Dr. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as saying this was where <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> enjoyed a reign of dissolution with his male lover, <PERSON> Piers </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON>, before being deposed and murdered at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1327. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> was born in 1284, the son of King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> by his Spanish first wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Castile </LOCATION>. His father trained the prince in warfare and statecraft but the son acquired habits of extravagance and frivolity which he retained throughout his life. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> attributed his son's attitude to the influence of his <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> friend <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON>, a Gascogny knight, and drove the Frenchman into exile. But when <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> died in 1307, his son's first act on becoming king was to bring back to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> the man he called his `` brother Piers.'' <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON> acted as regent in control of the realm when <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to marry <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>, daughter of the French king <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, in 1308. She was to bear the king two sons and two daughters. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>'s barons grew indignant over <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON>'s influence and twice insisted on his banishment. But on each occasion, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> soon recalled his friend. The barons finally went to war against the king and <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON>, killing <PERSON> Gaveston </PERSON> and forcing <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> to stand aside while a baronial committee took over the government. In 1327, <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> and her lover <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> deposed <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>. He was imprisoned and one of his sons was chosen as king. Tradition has it <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> was murdered with a red hot poker. The palace is mentioned in the 19th century antiquarian study, `` A History of the King's Works,'' and an illustration of the site appears in a map by the 16th century cartographer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> is believed to have modeled Falstaff, a rambunctious lover of life who appears in both the `` King Henry IV'' plays and `` The Merry Wives of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>,'' on <PERSON> Fastolf </PERSON>. But The Times said the discovery near the house of jetties and inlets suggested <PERSON> Fastolf </PERSON> in fact was not much like the character the Elizabethan playwright created. `` There are far more docking installations than we had suspected. The evidence suggests that he was an important merchant'' and therefore not a knight, <ORGANIZATION> Hammerson </ORGANIZATION> said. The Times said <PERSON> Fastolf </PERSON> built the house in 1446. It said the finds at the site of the house were known to include large amounts of leatherwork, pewter ware and a tall felt hat.

<HEAD>Kasparov Ahead In Dutch Tournament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet world chess champion <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> has taken the lead in a four-player spectacular that pits him against arch-rival <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in their first meeting since the championship last year. Halfway through the tournament, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> topped the standings Thursday with four points for an unbeaten performance of two wins and four draws from the six rounds played so far in the event. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, also from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, was running a close second, lagging half a point behind the champion. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in 1985 to become world champion and retained his title last year in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. In their first match since <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, the two drew. In the second match, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> came out on top in a fantastic win. That game, in which <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> played white against his arch enemy's pet Caro-Kann defense, was one of the wildest and most exciting in recent tournament play at the grandmaster level, according to visiting British grandmaster <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>. After the `` great K's'', as they have become known, drew their first encounter since last year's world title match in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, experts were predicting the same result in Wednesday's match. But <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> sprung a surprise on <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and on the all-knowing experts. After just 16 moves, he sacrificed a knight and followed up with an all-out attack on the black King's side that grandmaster <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said was `` a perfect example of pure fighting chess.'' Experts in the press room were at a loss to explain <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s daring play and the one-hundred strong audience in the tournament hall were standing on their seats to miss nothing of the hair-raising duel <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> initially weathered the onslaught, capturing a second piece and countering with a mating threat of his own. But problems arose as he ran into time trouble. On the 25th move, he missed a chance to win in one move. On the 39th, he exceeded the time limit where he was one move short of the control in a position that the experts afterwards said was probably a draw. Against <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON> in Thursday's sixth round, <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> was his old self again, coolly making the most of his slim advantage in a Queen's Indian, gradually increasing the pressure against black's weakened center and clinching victory on the 39th move. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s encounter with Dutchman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, ranked third on the world rating list, was more of an anticlimax. The world champion, playing white, refrained from taking the initiative against his theoretically weaker opponent. Visiting grandmaster <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> hypothesized that <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> was still `` somewhat dizzy'' from his victory over <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>. Early on, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> had some trouble in stopping white's attack, but eventually evened out around his 40th to sign the peace five moves later. The tournament, with a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> category 17 and an average rating of 2,674 points _ the strongest ever held _ will continue Sunday with <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> facing <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> playing <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> in seventh-round action. After six rounds, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> had 4 points; <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> 3 -LCB-; <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> 3; and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> der Wiel 1 -LCB-.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> on Friday proposed that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> hold talks on being co-hosts for the Olympic Games opening in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, head of the largest opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, made the proposal at a meeting of 71 party members who were recently elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` If possible, we need to explore ways to co-host the Olympics through talks between political parties of the two sides,'' he said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 62, said he believes <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is less enthusiastic about taking part in the Olympics but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should persuade them to attend. The opposition leader said he would inform the government of his idea when he visits the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Organizing Committee on Saturday. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said if the issue of being co-hosts is solved, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would benefit by ensuring the security of the Olympics and forcing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its closed society, thereby promoting chances of national unification. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denoucned <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s statement as `` a irresponsible political maneuvering'' that may compound the Olympic and other inter-Korea issues <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-wee </PERSON> said although all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people are free to debate the Olympics matter, it is necessary that the government should serve as a `` unified'' channel of dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The nation's two other opposition groups, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reacted with skepticism to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-won </PERSON> quoted his party leader, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, as saying, `` The proposal is impossible to be be put into practice.'' New Democratic spokesman <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-jik </PERSON> said, `` All unification-related debate should be open, but it is desirable that dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should be conducted through concerned government authorities.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> unless it is made a co-host. Despite its threat to organize a Communist-bloc boycott, a record 161 nations, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, have said they would send athletes to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The International Olympic Committee said any idea of having both nations serve as hosts would be a violation of the Olympic charter.

<TEXT>
 Police wielding riot sticks dispersed about 300 demonstrators Friday who marched near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and demanded removal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> urged President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to notify the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> immediately if she does n't plan to extend the lease on the six bases. A crowd of anti-nuclear activists chanting anti-American slogans marched to within 20 yards of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Police moved in after the protesters refused to stop the march. Reporters said some demonstrators sat on the ground and were dragged away by police. At least 11 demonstrators were taken to a nearby precinct, but police said they did n't make any arrests. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> told a civic group that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should take a public position on the issue, the subject of talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The president has pledged to allow the bases to remain here until their lease expires in 1991, but she has refused to say whether she would agree to an extension. `` You can not keep your options open until 1991, because one year before 1991 you must already give notice of your intention to terminate,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. In related development, Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> filed a bill Friday banning the use of `` futuristic'' weapons in the country. The proposal supplements earlier congressional bills outlawing the use of any part of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for storage of nuclear weapons. `` It is hereby declared illegal for any part of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory to be used for assembly, storage, deployment, transit, or any other use of any futuristic weapons like laser beams, laser rays and particle beam generators,'' the bill said. The bill would make it illegal for a person to bring into the country even components of such weapons. Violators could face 10 years to life in prison. The bill proposes that foreigners found to have violated the ban be deported after serving the full prison sentence.

 Funerals for 14 young people who died in a fiery bus crash were being held today after a huge memorial service for all 27 victims, at which a minister told tearful mourners, `` Do n't blame God.'' A mass funeral is scheduled tonight for seven of the victims at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the bus. Separate funerals for the other four were being held today and tonight. Three victims of the disaster were eulogized this morning in funeral services in two <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> towns and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It just got terribly emotional at the Our Father. I just got all choked up. It was a moment when the whole church just let go together,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bardstown </LOCATION>, where a funeral Mass was said for <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 12. In his homily, <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> likened the child's death to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s final departure from his beloved church at <LOCATION> Ephesus </LOCATION>, where `` in tears -LRB- the Ephesians -RRB- gave him up because they would not see him again.'' An estimated 6,000 people, including Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, packed <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s football stadium for the memorial service in this town near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> Thursday night. The stadium is next to the cemetery where many of the victims are being buried. `` Why do bad things happen to good people?,'' asked the Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, whose Baptist church lost two members in the crash. `` None of us can answer that question. And if we could, it would n't take away your grief. `` I suggest that you do not blame anybody on that bus. I suggest that you do n't blame God; God did not cause this,'' he added. `` There is sin in this world ... and there are those who make wrong choices, and innocent people pay the price.'' Twenty-four children and three adults were killed Saturday night when a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 struck the bus, rupturing its fuel tank and setting it ablaze. The truck's driver allegedly was drunk and has been charged with 27 counts of murder The crash occurred 100 miles northeast of this Army post town, as the bus carried members of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s youth group and guests home from a day at an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. At the stadium Thursday, many people broke down during the singing of `` What a Friend We Have in Jesus'' at the start of the service. Many clasped hands and supported others during prayers. Bleachers in the stadium can hold 2,400 people, and chairs were set up on the field to boost capacity to about 4,000. Rows of people crowded around the perimeters of the field. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, read letters from President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Your pain and loss is ours too,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' letter. `` Your countrymen are with you in prayer.''

 The pop of a burning piano's strings was sweet music to its owner, who credits the noise with awakening him in time to escape a fire that destroyed his home. `` I was awakened by a ping, ping, ping,'' said <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, 41. `` It sounded like someone playing it, but it was a high, shrill sound.'' Thursday's fire, apparently sparked by a faulty electrical heater in the basement, quickly enveloped the two-story wood house in this western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> town, fire officials said. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s wife and a son had already left for work and school when the fire spread and the sound of the piano woke <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. Flames caused the piano's strings to snap, creating the `` pinging'' sound. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said he opened his eyes to see smoke curling under the door of the bedroom. He grabbed his clothes and made his way through thick, black smoke to the front door, he said. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said he and his wife bought the piano for their younger son to practice on. An older son no longer lives at home. `` I'm just thankful we had the piano,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure I would have awoke if it had n't been for it.''

<TEXT>
 Away from the balloons and the lights of politics, a lawyer and a onetime bricklayer run a computer-driven operation pulling in the delegates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Until recently, they have worked in obscurity, but as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gotten closer to his goal they've been getting more recognition. `` My profile has gotten raised so much in the last week it's frightening,'' said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, the 32-year-old lawyer who oversees delegate selection for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign While the candidate was on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> meeting with congressional leaders during a recent trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> was across town having quiet discussions with labor union officials. `` Just kind of floating around'' is how he describes his activities that day. The previous day, he said, he, too, had been up at the Capitol `` and had floated around a little.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, the deputy director of delegate selection, was back at campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, minding the store. More than 85 percent of the 1,645 delegates <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gained so far have been won in primaries and caucuses. But the rest, including party leaders, politicians, the uncommitted and delegates originally supporting other candidates, have been won one at a time. Winning them has risen in importance as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strives to nail down the total needed for nomination _ 2,081 _ by the end of the primaries on June 7. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> run a 15-member staff whose mission is to soft-sell delegates on the idea of voting for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, although `` sell'' is a work neither of them likes to use. `` I hate to think of a person running for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a product,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> says. The job is about 70 percent science and 30 percent art, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> says. Computers keep track of how many times a delegate has been contacted and by whom, along with political and biographical information. `` It goes through various stages,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> says. `` At the initial stage it's just sort of introductory. Then it goes more to the persuasion stage and then to the conversion stage.'' The marching orders: Be persistent, be helpful but do n't be pushy. `` The train-leaving-the-station and other similar approaches are not effective,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> says. `` It causes resentment.'' On occasion, the staff lines up calls for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself to make to close the deal. `` He's very good on the phone,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> says. `` He's very persuasive on the phone.'' The operation runs from around 9 a.m. to nearly midnight, and someone is working every day, she says. The pace will pick up in June, when many states that started their processes months ago finally get around to picking their delegates. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> gained experience in delegate tracking for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 and before that for <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was one of three presidential candidates who wanted to hire him for 1988, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> says. He wo n't name the other two. He and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met one night as the candidate was being driven around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, attending house parties for his long-shot campaign. The impression was strong enough that <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, whose wife was pregnant at the time, quit his job at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Strawn </PERSON>, took a nearly 50 percent pay cut and moved to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to work for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> had known <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for 14 years, having worked on his first gubernatorial campaign and later having been his student at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. In the meantime, she has been policy director for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has run a program to help women get jobs in the construction industry and has been a communications director for the bricklayers union. She also learned how to lay bricks and says she can swing a hammer with skill. The caution of a lawyer and the methodical approach of a bricklayer have met with success. For example, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, a Democratic national committeewoman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, says she gets about two calls a week from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, and while she's still uncommitted, she's leaning toward the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. But for some phone-weary delegates the sale may be tough. <PERSON> Keron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has an answering machine on her telephone that says, `` Hello, this is <PERSON> Keron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>. My delegate status is still uncommitted.''

<HEAD>Money Crunch Causes Pentagon to Cut Buying, Hiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government accounting practices and the deficit-reduction drive prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to stop buying office supplies, ban overtime and limit civilian hiring for at least the next six weeks. All new contracts for research and development work also have been put on hold temporarily, as have purchases of everything from magazine and newspaper subcriptions to television sets, library materials, recreation equipment, lawn mowers and furniture. Tools, paint, lumber, air conditioners and forklifts also are on the prohibited list for the time being, as are plans to lease cars, office space or computer equipment. The new restrictions, ordered by Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, will remain in place at least through June 30. They were prompted by the terms of a deficit-reduction compromise reached by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last November. That compromise was crafted to control government outlays _ the amount of money actually spent during a fiscal year. Within the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, however, the number that counts is one known as budget authority _ the amount of money that can be obligated, regardless of when it is going to be spent. For example, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorizes $ 100 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to buy a new ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has $ 100 million in multi-year budget authority but might pay out only $ 10 million for work performed the first year. All that makes it difficult for the Pentagon to project precisely how much it will pay out in a fiscal year; a contractor might get more or less work done than originally expected. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said the Pentagon now has to worry as well about the fiscal 1988 outlay estimate contained in the deficit-reduction agreement _ $ 277.3 billion. `` One dollar of obligations almost always results in one dollar of outlays,'' he told reporters. `` Whether it results in a dollar of outlays on Sept. 28 -LRB- fiscal 1988 -RRB- as opposed to Oct. 2 -LRB- fiscal 1989 -RRB- certainly should n't be a large management concern. And yet, because of the focus on the deficit, which is toted against outlays, this is our problem ...'' Based on spending reports received in March and April, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is paying out dollars at a rate that by the end of the year on Sept. 30 would put outlays some $ 2.5 billion above the $ 277.3 billion total, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. While the outlay totals for those two months might be `` an aberration'' and spending will even out in future months, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> ca n't take any chances, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said, `` so we are trying to get at discretionary spending that can be deferred for six weeks ...'' The spending hold will probably slow only about $ 500 million in outlays, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said, but that will start attacking the problem while figures for May are compiled and officials see just how serious a problem they have. One wild card in the projections involves the value of the dollar against foreign currencies, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. Up to $ 1 billion of that $ 2.5 billion in faster-than-expected outlays was needed to shore up allowances for soldiers overseas, he said.

<HEAD>Network Seeking To Stop State From Enforcing Ban on Exit Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking an injunction against the state of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to keep it from enforcing its prohibition on exit polls, used by the media to forecast the winners of elections. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> law forbids anyone to question voters about their choices within 200 feet of a polling place. Violations are misdemeanors punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of $ 500. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> maintains the law violates its First Amendment rights of free speech and commentary on the electoral process. The ban interferes with the gathering and reporting of truthful and significant information about the political process on election day, the network argued in federal court papers. `` Carried to its logical extreme, two neighbors coming out of a polling place after voting could not ask how the other voted,'' said Billings attorney <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who is representing <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who seek accurate, legitimate information can not do so.'' The lawsuit, filed Thursday, asks for preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop the state from enforcing the 200-foot prohibition. Defendants in the suit are Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Greely </PERSON> and Commissioner of Political Practices <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Colburg </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Colburg </PERSON> and Greely were out of their offices today and unavailable for comment. The 1985 law was an outgrowth of the 1980 presidential election, when the major TV networks declared <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the winner before polls had closed in the Mountain and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> time zones. The restriction was sought so that voters in the West would not be discouraged from voting because the election was already declared over by the media.

 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Niveen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahman </PERSON> does the housework for her family now that her mother is in jail. She cooks and cleans, and when clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers erupt, she runs to the streets to help youngsters choking on tear gas. `` I am doing the same as my mother. It's my duty,'' said <PERSON> Niveen </PERSON>, sitting in her family's cement block house in the Shati refugee camp. In the next room was a box full of chickens that the family is raising to eat as the Arab uprising persists, bringing with it worsening economic conditions. A new role for Moslem children and women, both held under strict rule in the traditional religious society, is one of the changes spawned by the nearly six-month rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures through April, a quarter of the 4,344 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> injured in the revolt were under 16. Israeli authorities complain that their soldiers are increasingly facing women and children rioters. `` Now we are the leaders,'' said 19-year-old <LOCATION> Rafat </LOCATION>, sitting on the floor of another cement block house down the street from <PERSON> Niveen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahman </PERSON>'s home. `` Youth are leading, burning tires, stoning soldiers,'' said <PERSON> Rafat </PERSON>, who would not give his last name. `` Women try to help the boys who are arrested or try to stop arrests. They go to the kids when soldiers throw tear gas.'' <PERSON> Niveen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahman </PERSON>'s mother, <LOCATION> Widad </LOCATION>, was arrested this month as an `` inciter'' along with two other women in Shati. They were the first women to be jailed in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> under administrative detention laws, where no trials or specific charges are required. Each was given six months in prison. Palestinian activitist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Khas </PERSON> says the arrests showed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has recognized the new power of women in the uprising. Women, allowed out during curfew, became messengers and lookouts, she said. `` Women found their authority and strength and started organizing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Khas </PERSON>, who runs a kindergarten program throughout the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. As for Palestinian youth, Ms. <PERSON> Khas </PERSON> said, `` They did what youngsters do _ try to change things. It was a spontaneous mass revolt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and fundamentalist Moslem groups are behind the rebellion, but Ms. <PERSON> Khas </PERSON> said it was the young, `` the grassroots leadership,'' that kept the uprising going. She pointed out that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had arrested many traditional leaders active in PLO-organized committees of lawyers, doctors and other professionals, but still the revolt persists. `` They're all the time arresting what they call the leadership, but they have n't gotten the leaders,'' she said. <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Gaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the stifling life of the refugee camps has spawned young leaders who do not have their parents' fear of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. `` The uprising right now is led by youth age 15 to 25. Most live in the refugee camps around the strip and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They will never listen to the older generation.'' <PERSON> Agha </PERSON> described the revolt this way: `` Most of the men go to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and leave their sons at home to throw stones.'' He said sons sometimes stop fathers from going to work, but not forever. <PERSON> Agha </PERSON>, who has a Ph.D. from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, said many of the youth in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> have taken up the hard-line ideas of the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, a radical fundamentalist group that wants an Islamic state including all of what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said if the revolt persists with no Israeli concessions, youth will emerge as political leaders and replace so-called moderates who would be satisfied with a Palestinian state alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The young men on the streets think they are winning, since they have faced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s might with only rocks and painted slogans. One day last week, a group of boys and young men set a tire ablaze at the entrance to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They were waiting by the road with stones in hand. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, who said he was 15 but looked years younger, said they wanted revenge for Arabs beaten earlier, and they hoped <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers would come by. They also were targeting cars taking workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. `` I do n't go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said. `` My work is here _ throwing stones.''

<HEAD>Cash for Food Said `Last Resort' to Aid Starving Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's plan to give cash to the Contra rebels inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is `` a last resort'' aimed at feeding the starving remnants of the guerrilla force, the head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid program said Friday. `` There are people inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> who are desperate ... we've had reports of people eating tree roots,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said AID plans to send cash at the rate of $ 1 per day per rebel, but is still working out the details. A March 23 agreement between the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government permits humanitarian aid to be sent to the rebels while the two sides hold peace talks. But a dispute over how the aid should be delivered has meant no help has yet been sent, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> came up with the cash plan as a substitute, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. `` We have taken this particular step as a last resort,'' he said, to keep the Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> while the peace talks are proceeding and thus keep the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Up to 3,000 rebels have reportedly fled across the Nicaraguan border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to search for food in recent weeks. `` We are seeing resistance fighters coming out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at a high rate,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. Details of the cash plan are still being worked out, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said, but that at the rate of $ 1 per rebel per day for a 30-day period, the program will cost an estimated $ 450,000. The money, in the Nicaraguan currency of cordobas, will sent by courier, he said. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcomittee, was skeptical about the proposal `` This is a pretty weak accounting system,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said, adding that the plans `` raise serious questions about compliance with existing legislative restrictions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specifically banned spending any of the aid money for weapons, and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said that will be difficult to do because cordobas are not generally accepted outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said `` we are concerned'' about accounting for the money, but he told <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> on several occasions, `` We're doing the best we can under the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> won praise from two Republicans on the subcommittee, Sens. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> said, `` It really is a difficult situation'' while <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> said, `` It's very easy to criticize, but you're operating under very difficult circumstances.'' The direct shipments of food have not begun because the two sides can not agree on a neutral organization, a requirement spelled out by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in March when it voted $ 48 million in humanitarian aid. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has been rejected by the Contras as a delivery agency, but he did n't know why. `` The simple bottom line ... is that if they'd reach agreement, we'd start delivering food,'' he said. AID will use any agency the two sides approve, even the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> told the subcommiteee. `` Any mechanism the two sides approve is better than what we're doing,'' he said. The Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a temporary truce in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on March 23. They agreed to try to negotiate a permanent cease-fire during a 60-day period starting April 1.

<HEAD>Kentucky Land Bank To Receive $90 Million Under New Farm Credit

<TEXT>
 About $ 90 million in federal aid has been approved for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, the board's chief executive officer, said the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> bank will receive assistance through the sale of up to $ 90 million in preferred stock to the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will raise funds for that investment by selling 15-year bonds. The board and corporation were created by last year's Agricultural Credit Act to help bail out the financially distressed Farm Credit System, a network of cooperatively owned farm banks and associations <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> bank, which serves borrowers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, applied to the board for financial help in February. He said the board and the bank have `` reached agreement on a number of steps which will continue to strengthen'' the institution's financial management. Although the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> bank had presented `` a well-thought-out, workable plan for financial recovery,'' its stock had dropped to 65 percent of par value and was unable to implement the plan without federal help, he said. `` The bank has made substantial progress in resolving its own financial problems over the past two years,'' <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> said. Programs included an asset-liability management program in 1986 to control interest rate risks and reduce costs, and a market-based loan pricing system in 1987 to provide competitive rates to borrowers. Also, he said, the bank `` reduced its non-performing loans and inventory of acquired property by 30 percent, and projects a similar reduction this year.'' <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kling </PERSON>, a spokewoman for the board, said the $ 90 million for the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> bank was `` the first full-blown'' assistance designated under the new law. Earlier this year, the board approved $ 25 million in `` limited purpose'' assistance in short-term funding to help the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, stay in business. And $ 20.5 million was provided to retire stock in six financially troubled production credit associations in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, districts. `` But this is the first one that we've done under the general context of helping the bank'' in general, Ms. <PERSON> Kling </PERSON> said.

 Devastating earthquakes have occurred only every 200 to 400 years on the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>, says a study that provides some comfort for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> worried about a repeat of the deadly 1906 quake. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON>, who presented her study of earthquake frequency Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s spring meeting in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said she found evidence of six great quakes in the last 2,000 years along a 260-mile stretch of the fault. The last was the 1906 shaker that killed at least 2,500 people. At this interval, it would mean that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area is unlikely to have a devastating quake within the next 100 years and possiby much longer, said <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON>'s professor and co-author, geologist <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON> cautioned the study is preliminary, so while `` one is tempted to conclude -LRB- with certainty -RRB- that a great earthquake is not likely in the near future in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, that would be a premature conclusion at this point.'' The study involved only the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>. The Hayward Fault and other faults in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also pose a threat, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says the probability of a damaging earthquake in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in the next 30 years is about 50 percent. So `` people should n't get too complacent'' because of the new study, <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON> made excavations across the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> about 160 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and found evidence of at least six large quakes in the last 2,000 years, suggesting an occurrence of every 300 to 400 years. However, the study also found evidence the fault is building up strain at a rate that suggests the interval between large quakes might be only 200 years, <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON> said. The 1906 quake ruptured a stretch of fault that starts just south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION>, then runs south through <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bautista </LOCATION>. Federal emergency officials have estimated a repeat of the quake would kill up to 11,000 people, seriously injure up to 44,000 and cause $ 38 billion in damage. For <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, forecasts of a great quake's advent are grimmer. Based on other studies, including work by <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says another major devastating quake in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is more than 50 percent likely within the next 25 years. Federal officials have projected that a great quake on the southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> would kill up to 14,000 people, injure up to 55,000 and cause $ 17 billion in damage. <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON>'s research on the southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> suggests great quakes occur an average of every 140 years on the section from <LOCATION> Tejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. The last such quake occurred in 1857. He also found the next segment to the southeast, from <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, breaks in a great or major quake an average of every 200 to 250 years, with the last such quake more than 300 years ago, suggesting the segment is overdue for a big quake.

<TEXT>
 A prostitute arrested on charges of attempted manslaughter for selling sex while carrying AIDS has been sent home because of her failing health. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON>, 24, was released from jail and placed under house arrest. Ms. <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON> was arrested five months ago after investigators said she twice had sex with men knowing she carried the deadly virus. The charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence, but she remained in jail while the prosecution appealed the dismissal. On Thursday, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cycmanick </PERSON> reduced her bail from $ 14,000 to $ 1,000 because of her declining health and a doctor's prognosis that she had less than three years to live. `` There is no way this girl will physically be able to get on the streets again,'' her attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheaffer </PERSON>, said at the hearing. `` I believe her last days should be spent with some degree of dignity. We should n't allow her to die like we would n't allow some animals to die.'' The AIDS virus triggered severe infections in most of her vital organs last month, said her doctor, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. She had surgery, a seizure and almost died twice of heart failure, he said. `` I feel real great about going home,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON>, frail but smiling as she left the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>. She was steadied by her attorney. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> wrote the judge that he counseled Ms. <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON> about the possibilities of transmitting the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through sex, but added, `` The ability to understand the gravity of the situation was found to be uninterpretable by the patient.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON> argued that her release could endanger the public, noting she had ignored previous counseling against having sex because she carried the AIDS virus. Her mother, <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON>, burst into tears when asked by <PERSON> Sheaffer </PERSON> if her daughter's grave condition would make her watch her daughter more closely. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherouse </PERSON>, a nurse's aide, said she and her son would supervise her daughter.

 Art thieves smashed a window in the Municipal Museum early Friday and stole three masterpieces worth up to $ 52 million, including works by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>. It was the biggest art theft in Dutch history. The burglars broke a ground-floor window before dawn in the museum's north wing, which is relatively sheltered from public view, said museum spokesman <PERSON> Maarten </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertheux </PERSON>. The thieves then walked through five galleries to reach the room where the works were hanging, he said. Stolen were `` Carnations,'' an 1888 work by the Dutch painter <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>; `` Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by the French master <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>; and `` The House of <PERSON> Maitre </PERSON> <PERSON> Billaud </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION>,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON>. Two other valuable <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings, `` The Diggers'' and `` The Rocking Chair,'' were hanging in the same gallery but were not taken. <PERSON> Rini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON>, the museum's deputy director, said they may have been left because they are substantially larger than the others. Museum director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said the stolen paintings are worth an estimated $ 52 million, although experts from <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> estimated their worth at $ 11 million. The Municipal Museum houses a collection of about 3,000 works from the 19th and 20th centuries and is next door to the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gogh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which has 220 paintings by the Dutch master, the world's largest collection Beeren and other art experts speculated that the theft was commissioned by a private art collector, since the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> are too famous to be sold publicly and since the other <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> works were n't taken. `` I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a clear purpose in mind,'' <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said. `` This'll go straight to somebody's room or home.'' `` There's a very good reporting system -LRB- on art thefts -RRB- these days ... If they're offered for sale at a bona fide art dealer or auction house, that'll be known right away,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeman </PERSON> of the Van Gogh Museum. <PERSON> Bertheux </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that there was no one in the museum at the time of the burglary. Around-the-clock surveillance by security personnel was abolished in 1975 to save money. Authorities were alerted when an alarm went off about 5 a.m., but there were conflicting accounts on when the theft was discovered. Police spokesman <PERSON> Joost </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijngaarden </PERSON> said police arrived at 5:10 a.m., entered the museum through the broken window and `` found nothing missing.'' He said officers then left the museum and that private security guards discovered the theft about 90 minutes later. But <PERSON> Bertheux </PERSON> said museum officials discovered the theft almost immediately when they entered the building's main lobby and ran past the targeted gallery on their way to investigate the broken window. `` This is a terrible loss of prestige for -LRB- museum -RRB- security,'' <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> told reporters at an impromptu news conference. He appeared shaken and pale. The paintings were not insured against theft. <PERSON> Beeren </PERSON> said he based his loss estimate on the fact that `` there is a <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> involved, and recent price developments -LRB- for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON> -RRB- have been dramatic.'' In March 1987, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' fetched $ 39.8 million at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid $ 53 million for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON> said experts from <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s based their estimate on black and white photographs of the paintings in a museum catalog. According to <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> is worth $ 1.6 million to $ 2.1 million; the <ORGANIZATION> Cezanne </ORGANIZATION> is worth $ 7.9 million; and the Jongkind is worth $ 147,000. The nation's last major art theft was in February 1987, when nine pieces, including works by French painter <PERSON> Jean-Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> and Dutch master <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruegel </PERSON>, vanished from an art gallery in the southern city of <LOCATION> Maastricht </LOCATION>. The loss was estimated at $ 2.65 million. The paintings were never recovered.

<HEAD>Merchant Seamen to Sail Again - This Time As Veterans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Merchant seamen who braved submarine-infested waters to keep weapons flowing to World War II battlefields will sail again, finally recognized as veterans of a war that ended four decades ago. Their voyage on Saturday will last only a few hours, but it will be aboard a ship sure to recall for many the hazardous days of their youth. The five-hour cruise will be on the SS <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last Liberty Ship still in operating condition. The <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> will go out the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> where wreaths will be cast on the sea in memory of the more than 5,000 merchant seamen who died in the war _ they, too, veterans at last. In January, prodded by a federal judge, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recognized the civilian sailors who served on ocean-going merchant ships during World War II as veterans _ a title it extended earlier to 13 other civilian groups, including women who served as wartime telephone operators in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The designation makes the former seamen eligible for certain veterans benefits, including the right to be buried in a national cemetery. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, 72, who will be aboard the <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> on Saturday, said the delay in the granting of veteran status stemmed in part from jealousy. `` There was a lot of animosity toward us from members of the other services,'' said <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, who was a captain on a ship that was sunk by a mine off <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` We got a lot more money and our pay went up when we entered a combat zone. Some guys thought of us as draft dodgers.'' But he noted that there were also benefits provided to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and other services but not to merchant sailors. `` For one thing, our pay stopped if we were captured,'' he said. The merchant sailors are old now, and few will use such benefits as the GI <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, which helped educate so many former sailors and soldiers. `` Most are dead,'' said <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. `` There were about 250,000 members of the merchant marine but only about 80,000 are still alive.'' There's one benefit <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> is particularly glad he is now entitled to. `` There'll be an American flag given to my relatives when I die,'' he said with pride. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, like many former merchant sailors living in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, spends time working as a volunteer on the 441-foot <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the last unaltered example of 2,751 Liberty Ships built between 1941 and 1945. Except for the annual cruise, the ship stays docked near Fisherman's Wharf where it is visited each year by thousands of tourists who want to see the type of ship that was part of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Bridge to Victory.'' Another sailor veteran, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasnosky </PERSON>, 76, recalls voyages during which `` the Germans hit us with everything _ subs, planes.'' In one case, his convoy was abandoned by the British destroyer that was escorting it, and 23 out of 33 of the merchant ships were sunk by the Germans. `` But I never got sunk,'' said <PERSON> Krasnosky </PERSON>, who plans to make the trip on the <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. `` I was lucky.'' `` The guys at the union hiring hall would all want to know what ship I was going to sign on,'' he said. `` They'd want to sign too'cause I was so lucky.''

 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> censored it, the Fish Head Kazoo Band played it and the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rejected it. But ignoring the three-chord rock classic `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'' will be difficult in many cities this weekend. Not in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, however. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city is one of 45 around the country holding `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'' parades this year to raise funds for the <ORGANIZATION> Leukemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. But in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, where a national movement to ban the song and its supposedly obscene lyrics began nearly 25 years ago, the parade will be in late June or early July. It ca n't be held this weekend because of scheduling conflicts associated with time trials for the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 auto race, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eschenbacher </PERSON>, executive director of the group's local chapter. The <ORGANIZATION> Leukemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s national headquarters, recognizing the song's history, even sent copies of the lyrics in its information packets. `` They wanted to make sure that we, as executive directors, knew that they were all OK words, something we could publish,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eschenbacher </PERSON> said. Thirty parades were scheduled this weekend in cities including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> parade, in its fifth year, has drawn 70,000 spectators and 50 floats, brigades and marching bands. The groups, who play only `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>,'' include the Bucks County Fish Head Kazoo Band and the Future Yuppies of <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. The rhythm-and-blues ditty concerning a sailor telling a bartender about his girlfriend has come a long way since it was first recorded in 1956 by the Pharaohs. The 1963 version by the <ORGANIZATION> Kingsmen </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, bar band, reached No. 2 in the charts and the controversy began early the following year when an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> teen-ager wrote then-Gov. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>. If the song was played at a slow speed, the boy said, the lyrics sounded dirty. Welsh asked the state's radio stations not to play the song. The matter eventually was turned over to the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> New </PERSON>, chief trial deputy of the prosecutor's office, said he heard nothing obscene. `` The record is an abomination of out-of-tune guitars, an overbearing jungle rhythm and clanging cymbals,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, pronounced the recording `` unintelligible at any speed.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, an original member of the <ORGANIZATION> Kingsmen </ORGANIZATION>, said the song had become a theme of sorts in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> before his instrumental group decided to record it in hopes of landing a job on a cruise ship. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, our original singer, knew more words than anybody else, so he yelled the majority of it,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said in a 1986 interview. `` It was basically done to feature the drums and the guitar, so <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> just kind of yelled into the drum mike. It turned out that you could n't understand what was being said, part of the beauty of the recording process.'' The song was revived in the hit movie `` Animal House'' and was selected by a wine cooler company to promote its product. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Coolers even put the <ORGANIZATION> Kingsmen </ORGANIZATION> on the road for a series of free concerts a couple of years ago. Rhino Records has issued a `` Best of <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>,'' complete with versions of the song as done by the Sandpipers, the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> and others. And there was a movement to have the tune proclaimed the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state song three years ago, which failed. As for those controversial lyrics to `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>,'' which was written by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> in 1956:

<HEAD>Navy Reverses Decision, Will Recover Helicopter Wreckage</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to recover the wreckage of a helicopter gunship that went down in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, rather than blowing it up on the seabed, a military official said Friday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reversed its decision `` to better enable investigators to determine the cause of the crash,'' specifically whether the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> AH-1 Cobra was lost to gunfire or missiles. The helicopter vanished on a night reconnaissance mission April 18, a few hours after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian naval forces had fought a series of day-long clashes in the southern gulf. It went down about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, where the Iranians have a military base. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> later claimed that its forces shot down the helicopter. The Iranians said they had recovered the wreckage, but offered no evidence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the Cobra's pilots reported in their last message that they were being tracked by hostile radar. There were no reports or indications of weapons being fired in the area afterward, the officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced several days ago that the wreckage, in several pieces about 130 feet deep off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> coast </LOCATION>, would be `` destroyed in place'' by underwater demolition divers. But Friday's statement said that `` in order to facilitate further investigation, given the condition of the wreckage, the decision was made to recover the aircraft wreckage except for the ordnance.'' The weapons would be `` destroyed separately,'' it said. The debris will be lifted by a seagoing crane that has been at the crash site for the past week with two salvage tugboats. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official also said the bodies of the two pilots, recovered earlier, will be flown to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, on Friday. The two Marines, Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33 and Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, based at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, have been declared `` Killed in Action,'' although the cause of the crash has yet to be estabished. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said that ruling could be made even if the aircraft was not actually shot down, but crashed while trying to evade hostile fire. The pilots were the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties in the April 18 clashes, and raised to 46 the number of Americans killed in military operations related to the gulf in the past year. The biggest single casualty toll was 37 sailors killed aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark May 17 last year when the warship came under a missile attack by an Iraqi warplane. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said the pilot had mistaken the Stark for an Iranian warship.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s powerful Parliament speaker on Friday repeated his government's claim that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and called for an arms buildup to fight the Americans in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The Americans have officially entered into a war with us,'' <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> told Revolutionary Guards commanders. He was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` We are really at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the present time.'' Six newly arrived <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships took up station in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and two others sailed into the gulf. But there was no sign of hostilities as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigates <PERSON> Pharris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, accompanied by the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON>, passed through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> where Iranian speedboats have attacked two commercial ships in recent days. The Pharris and <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> are part of an eight-ship battle group, headed by the aircraft carrier <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON>, that arrived in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> this week to provide air support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy and patrol operations in the gulf. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also told Moslem worshipers at a weekly prayer session in <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fought <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` they must wait to receive lots of their youths' dead bodies.'' Iranian leaders have repeatedly said they consider that their country has been at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buildup in the gulf in July to protect American-flagged ships from Iranian attack. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying: `` Should this war extend to new frontiers, the Americans will simply take delivery of the bodies of Americans throughout the world.'' Tension heightened since the Americans destroyed Iranian offshore oil platforms and sank an Iranian minelayer in the gulf last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and aircraft sank or disabled six Iranian vessels in a string of clashes April 18 in the most serious confrontation since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention. Iranian anger mounted after a long-range raid by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes on the <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the southern gulf May 14 in which five tankers were set ablaze. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the Americans jammed its radar and radio systems to help the Iraqis. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied that. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> reiterated that allegation Friday and said: `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships guided <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces and caused trouble for our defensive forces,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported. Despite the fiery rhetoric, the Iranians are clearly outgunned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf, especially since two of their frigates were either sunk or crippled in last month's naval clashes. Those two British-built warships comprised half the major operational warships the Iranians had. The Iranians still have several missile boats and a fleet of armed speedboats manned by Revolutionary Guards, which have attacked two neutral merchant ships in the gulf this week after a three-week lull. Following <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s recapture last month of the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, seized by the Iranians in February 1986, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dismissed the armed forces chief of staff, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohrabi </PERSON>. Unconfirmed reports from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> noted that other senior officers have been replaced, heightening the belief that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> seeks a more aggressive strategy to make up for the chain of recent defeats. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, closely allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, is considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and is the revolutionary patriarch's represenative on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Lesbianism, Drug Addiction at Penal Colony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women prisoners in a Soviet penal colony are driven to lesbianism and drugs by a demeaning life of ugly clothes and too many rules, a newspaper reported Friday in an unprecedented article about prison conditions. `` The regime of the colony gives rise to a destructive process in a woman,'' a prisoner identified only as <PERSON> Kutsyenkova </PERSON> told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. `` Marching in formation, ugly clothes, banging of iron, commands, meatless diet _ this makes one insipid, dull, leads one to search for emotional relief at any price,'' said the inmate, a former college lecturer whose doctoral dissertation was about the family. She told the newspaper that prisoners could fight off `` a breakdown'' for five years at the most, but `` then the organism catastrophically weakens'' and prisoners seek solace in smoking, lesbianism and narcotics. <PERSON> Kutsyenkova </PERSON> said the prisoner `` experiences an atrophy of will and initiative, a growing of uncontrollable rage.'' The article was one of the first about conditions in camps for women prisoners. Conditions at the country's notorious penal colonies and labor camps for men, described in the books of exile <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, were once taboo subjects for the Soviet media. But Kremlin chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of open discussion of the country's problems has produced several reports exposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system. The article described conditions at Corrective Labor Womens Colony No. 65-15 in <LOCATION> Kuybyshev </LOCATION>, 620 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The man in charge of the prisons, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON>, acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the article that improvements are needed. `` Quite a few problems have piled up in the system of corrective labor institutions,'' wrote <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON>, minister of internal affairs. `` Perestroika is needed also in this sphere in which the human factor should be made predominant too.'' Perestroika is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s term for his administrative and economic overhaul of Soviet society. The article said punishment of prisoners is often counterproductive, causing them to get into more trouble rather than lead them to rehabilitation. <PERSON> Kutsyenkova </PERSON> said some inmates do n't want to be freed because they have no families left outside after serving long prison terms. Two freed prisoners slept several nights outside the colony gate, `` praying to be taken back into the colony'' because they could n't live on their own, the article said The article did not say why <PERSON> Kutsyenkova </PERSON> had been jailed but said the colony's inmates had murdered husbands and children, taken bribes or engaged in other forms of corruption. Among the inmates were a director of a large store, senior lecturers at colleges, a chief bookkeeper and an engineer-economist, <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. Prisoners are forced to work shifts as long as 10-12 hours in sewing shops with poor ventilation, the article said. Punishment of 10-15 days in an isolation cell is meted out for such things as going out without a shawl, loudly saying goodnight to cellmates and smoking in a prohibited area, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> said his ministry is trying to improve the quality of its personnel at the colonies and labor camps. New criminal and corrective labor codes are being drafted to make the punishment more appropriately fit a convict's crime and to provide for a reduction of sentences in some cases. An experiment is planned in which prisoners will be released early for good work and good behavior. He did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism and drug addiction among the women prisoners. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried a report saying life in one camp outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is hard but that prisoners are treated fairly and given free time and an opportunity to get an education. Soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates take a conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to abide by the law. Western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people.

 Thousands of paramilitary troops and police fanned out across <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state Friday and raided <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> hideouts after reports that militant Sikhs murdered 43 people in an overnight crime spree. Police said a security red alert was issued in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikhs have allegedly murdered 195 people since May 9, when a government hold on the Sikhs' Golden Temple began. The siege of the holy shrine ended Wednesday with the surrender of the last of the militants holed up inside. At least 42 people, mainly Sikh militants, were killed during the 10-day standoff. Reporters were taken to the temple Friday for the first time since the siege and saw bloodstains, bullet marks, and arms and ammunition. The temple complex, normally visited by 10,000 pilgrims a day, looked shabby and deserted. A stench came from canisters used by the radicals as toilets during the siege. The Guru <PERSON> Granth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahib </PERSON>, the holy book of the Sikhs, lay under a cloth on the floor. There was a burn mark across the cloth that appeared to have been made by a bullet passing close to its surface. At least 43 people were killed in seven separate attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> late Thursday and Friday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. Five of the victims killed Thursday night were Hindu migrant workers from the eastern Indian state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, who were lined up against a wall and shot, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the second attack on migrant workers this week, suggesting that the extremists were trying to undercut the mainstay of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state's economy, which is agriculture. Other victims Thursday night included six killed in <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, six killed in <LOCATION> Bhatinda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, and three people were shot to death in separate incidents around the state. On Friday, five people were killed in a bomb attack on a bus near the town of <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION>, 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Police imposed a curfew in <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION> after 10 others were killed in separate bomb attacks, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Eight other deaths occured in <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> district on Friday. `` We fear Sikh terrorists will start a new wave of violence, in fact they are already on a killing spree,'' the director general of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> police, K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. He said police were put on extended hours and were under order to arrest and interrogate any suspect. <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said police imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION>. `` Time has come to hit the terrorists with iron fist, and this is what we are going to do,'' he said. At least 9,000 police and paramilitary troops raided suspected hideouts of Sikh radicals in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gurdashpur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> districts, a police officer told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The districts are considered strongholds of Sikh militants, who have been fighting since 1982 for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Golden Temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, has become a base for guerrillas waging the war. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said authorities recovered 44 weapons, including Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, light machine guns, grenades and 4,900 rounds of ammunition from inside the temple Friday. He said police also found $ 340,000 in Indian currency. The latest killings raised to at least 1,131 the number of people murdered by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. In all of 1987, about 1,030 people died. Sikhs, whose religion was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by Hindus. Sikhs are a minority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but comprise a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 Farmers and members of the political opposition tore down the plaque of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s legislature, and smashed and burned police vehicles in clashes with authorities that injured more than 100 people, police said. Riot police wielded clubs and erected barbed-wire barricades to disperse demonstrators in separate battles outside the legislature, a police station and the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. About 3,000 protesters demanding government assistance for farmers chanted slogans and marched through <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> streets before the battles, which marked the worst protest violence since the government eased restrictions on demonstrations last year. <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwa-cheng </PERSON> told reporters that the injured included policemen, protesters and reporters. He said police had detained 31 protesters. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said an unidentified protester exploded a firebomb outside the police station. The police official did not say if the explosion caused any injuries or damage. The demonstrators hurled rocks and clubs at 200 riot police who had blocked the entrance to the Legislative Yuan, where they had planned to hand in a petition for more farm aid. After police dragged three protesters inside, demonstrators stormed the police lines, broke several windows and tore down the `` Legislative Yuan'' plaque on the building, the home of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body Police beat back the protesters with clubs and rocks and dispersed the crowd with water cannons. But it regrouped and marched to <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to demand the release of the three protesters. More protesters were detained in clashes outside the party headquarters and a police station. Demonstrators burned one police motorcycle and smashed five police cars during the fighting at the police station, police said. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said a load of rocks was found hidden in one of the vans used by the protesters. Protesters said the government has helped industry but has ignored farmers, who have suffered because of low crop prices. One protest banner read: `` Our president holds a doctoral degree in agriculture, but farmers are suffering.'' The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> reported that President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> was deeply saddened by the news of the clashes and had instructed the Cabinet to act in accordance with the law.

<HEAD>Police Say Teens Who Stole Blasting Caps Planned to Blow Up

<TEXT>
 Three teen-agers arrested late last week had planned to blow up <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridges using 2,400 stolen blasting caps, police said Friday. `` The kids who stole the dynamite caps were telling other kids about it and they made comments about their plans to blow up bridges,'' <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sample </PERSON> said. `` I did n't take it as a joke at the time. And they certainly did n't tell us it was a joke during interrogation. Police arrested <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Caho </PERSON>, all 17, in the May 9 theft of 2,400 explosive blasting caps. The caps are owned by a mining equipment and supply company. Some are fused caps, which are extremely sensitive to shock, and others are electric caps that can be detonated by radio transmissions, police said. The suspects were jailed on felony burglary and theft charges. Their bond ranges from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000. In an interview from jail, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> he was joking when he told friends he might blow up a bridge. `` Most of the things we did were just spur-of-the-moment ideas,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He added he planned to sell the caps. Sample said it's unclear whether the blasting caps would have been powerful enough to blow up the highway bridges. `` The experts ... said that if you take 1,000 caps and put them together, you can make a 10-foot crater in the ground,'' Sample said. `` Whether they would hurt a steel bridge, we do n't know.'' He said all but about 60 of the stolen caps have been recovered.

<HEAD>Tutu Compares Apartheid to Nazism At Militant Campus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> compared apartheid to Nazism during an emotional ceremony Friday in which he was installed as chancellor of the country's most militant university. The black Anglican leader, who returned Thursday from a month in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also defended his controversial appeals for tougher Western sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told students and staff at the University of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. `` I want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can be done away with without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively by the South African media during his trip. His remarks have been denounced not only by the government but also by white and black moderates who contend that sanctions will increase black unemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms. `` There are those who seek to generate hysteria,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said of his critics. `` The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable, non-violent alternative.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against apartheid, was greeted by several hundred cheering students when he arrived at the university's main hall before the ceremony. His aides had to form a human wall around him as they ushered him through a crowd that chanted the archbishop's name and waved placards with slogans like `` Viva Sanctions'' and `` <PERSON> Viva </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees, political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of `` this vile and obscene system'' of apartheid. He said apartheid is `` so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil system _ Naziism.'' As chancellor at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> will be the honorary leader of a university that the government established for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its segregated educational system. He praised the university, near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s `` most potent academic institutional dissident. In the past decade, the university has increased its black enrollment from a handful to 13 percent of the 11,500 students. Its students and staff have grown increasingly militant in their opposition to apartheid, under which the nation's black majority has no voice in national affairs. The university's chief administrator, <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwel </PERSON>, says the campus will be `` an intellectual home for the left.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has been the target of government wrath for years because of his support of sanctions. Recently, the archbishop has drawn an unprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals. Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper often critical of the government, said in a recent editorial that blacks should insist that <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployed black squatter.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> home mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10.5 percent. VA spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Siciliano </PERSON> said the agency was making the change, which will take effect Monday, to reflect recent increases in interest rates in financial markets. In the past 16 months, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> rate has fluctuated between 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent. It has changed three times this year, with the last change coming on April 4 when the rate was increased from 9.5 percent to 10 percent. On Feb 1., the rate had been lowered a full percentage point to 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the national average for 30-year, conventional mortgages _ those without government guarantees _ rose to 10.52 percent this week from 10.40 percent last week. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said that effective Monday a variety of other mortgage rates will also rise by one-half percentage point. Graduated payment mortgages will increase to 10.75 percent, home improvement loans will rise to 12 percent and loans for mobile homes will increase to 13 percent. The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline and reaching a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in January 1987.

<HEAD>Armenians Demand Trials Be Opened To Observers And TV</HEAD>

 Demonstrators converged on the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building Friday to demand that the trials of those charged in ethnic rioting that killed 32 people be opened to television cameras and Armenian observers. An Armenian activist said in a telephone interview from the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, that the city was quiet after two large public gatherings earlier in the week. The demonstration by about 30 Armenians across the street from the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building indicated continuing skepticism about the prosecution of those suspected of involvement in three days of ethnic rioting that began Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. Twenty-six Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were killed in the violence, which was touched off by a dispute between the two southern Soviet republics over control of the mountainous <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Most residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> are ethnic Armenians, and they began agitating in February to be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. That touched off large demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in support of their demand. Uniformed and plainclothes police lined the sidewalk in front of the six-story <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but did not interfere with the protest. Armenian painter <PERSON> Koryun </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagapityan </PERSON>, 60, said he would present a declaration to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from unions representing Armenian artists, writers and other creative workers calling for `` full openness'' in criminal proceedings against more than 80 people charged in the rioting. Nagapityan read the declaration demanding several Armenians be allowed to attend the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> trials as observers, that proceedings not be left in the hands of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> authorities, that the names of the dead and missing in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> be published, and that the trials be carried live on state-run TV. Demonstrators unrolled paper signs reading, `` Recognize the fact of Armenian genocide in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>,'' `` Strictly punish the organizers of the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> slaughter,'' and `` We know the names of 50 victims of the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> slaughter.'' On Monday, an Azerbaijani metalworker, <PERSON> Talekh </PERSON> <PERSON> Salekh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogli </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON>, was found guilty of premeditated murder in the rioting, and given the maximum sentence of 15 years. <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON> was the first person convicted for taking part in the unrest. But Armenian sources said about 150,000 people gathered the next day in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to stress that conviction of people involved in the rioting did not meet their demands for solving the region's problems They said several thousand people also gathered in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and that the atmosphere in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was tense. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said in a telephone conversation from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Thursday that thousands more gathered that evening in a main city square. Contacted Friday, he said the Thursday gathering apparently broke up after about four hours with nothing happening, and that the city was quiet on Friday. Demonstrators in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> differed over the sentence given <PERSON> Ismailov </PERSON>. One Armenian who refused to give his name said: `` 15 years is not the issue. The issue is bringing those who organized the butchery to trial.'' But <PERSON> Nagapityan </PERSON> shouted `` Why does the person who committed such a crime have the right to live?'' One middle-aged <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman who said she was married to an <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION> argued briefly with the demonstrators, saying she disagreed with their version of the events in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, but she soon left. The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, opting instead for a long, expensive program of social and economic development.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s leading bookmakers has stopped taking bets on the sex and name of the Duchess of <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s unborn child because her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, was quoted as saying it will be a girl called <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. The Sun newspaper reported Friday that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered him a child's cricket bat. `` It wo n't be much use. I'm sure we are having a girl,'' the paper quoted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> as saying. It said the 28-year-old prince, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter pilot, told the guests the baby will be called <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, cricket is primarily played by boys. The former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who married Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s son in July 1986, is expecting their first child in August. Buckingham Palace said the report that the 28-year-old duchess was expecting a girl was just speculation. `` Certainly, we are not in a position to talk about the private coversations of the Duke of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It's all speculation,'' said a spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified. But <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, a spokesman for bookmakers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said: `` We decided that the reported remarks of the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the sex and name of the baby.'' <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s quote had surfaced soon after the duchess become pregnant, `` we might not have given it credence.'' But now that she's six months along, he said, `` they must have a good idea of what they would call the baby, be it male or female. After six months, if they want to know what the sex of the baby is, it's very easy to find out.'' In recent weeks, he said, <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> went from a 20-1 to 3-1 favorite. `` The last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy backing for the name <PERSON> William </PERSON> to be chosen as the name of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s firstborn, and of course we all know what happened there.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, and his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, chose <PERSON> William </PERSON> as the name of their first son, who was born in June 1982. <PERSON> William </PERSON> is second in line to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> throne behind his father. <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had taken in about $ 56,000 in bets on the name and sex of the baby. `` It's not as much as was bet on <PERSON> William </PERSON>, but it's more than on <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>,'' he said. Prince <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, the second son of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, was born in September 1984. <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said punters with an appetite for things royal would still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess' baby and its birth date. `` We're offering 7-1 against them being able to tell us the date on which the baby is born,'' he said.

 Scattered fog caused a 118-car chain-reaction accident on a major West German autobahn that injured 19 people, five of them critically, police said. Police said drivers traveled at too high a speed after the fog reduced drivers' visibility in a hilly region near the southern West German city. `` It's the usual here.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Friday backed down from previous threats to act against the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network for a documentary about apartheid, but it warned of a larger crackdown on the media. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he was considering the establishment of a government disciplinary body to monitor the press and criticized what he called `` media terrorists.'' In December, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had said he might take unspecified actions against the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> following the broadcast in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of the documentary, `` Children of Apartheid.'' The government had described the documentary, narrated by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, as `` blatant distortion.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Friday that the president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>, had issued a statement and that no action would be taken. The program consisted largely of interviews with young people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, both black and white. Among those interviewed were the daughters of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the jailed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The government complained about the way the film was made as well as the content. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> had misled the government about the project and had failed to obtain work permits. On Friday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> quoted <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> as saying that `` the circumstances surrounding the making of the program were such as to give grounds for objection by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> government and -LRB- CBS -RRB- regretted that it has not been meticulous in complying with South African procedures regarding foreign media.'' A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the network acknowledged that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has complex procedures and requirements that must be followed. `` We're proud that the documentary was broadcast,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also said that the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body established by newspapers in 1983 to monitor the news industry, had failed to act against publications that allegedly promoted revolutionary causes. `` Freedom of expression in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not be allowed to such an extent that it fosters chaos and revolt in the country,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suggested that the government body would be aimed at `` media terrorists.'' `` Media terrorists -LRB- are -RRB- people who do not have the guts to be terrorists themselves,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` I've heard it said it's an ego trip by dropouts from other fields of endeavor.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> already has extensive press restrictions. State of emergency regulations in effect since June 1986 restrict reporting on unrest, security force actions and many types of anti-government protests. Two anti-apartheid newspapers have been suspended by the government for publishing purported subversive material and several others have been warned that they could face action. By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was quoted Friday as saying he expects negotiations for a new agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to run into 1989. In an interview published in the satirical left-wing weekly <LOCATION> Pontiki </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said he did not think `` that we can easily finish in 1988.'' Under the present accord, the four <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases would have to close down 17 months after it expires Dec. 31, 1988. A shutdown notice has to be issued five months earlier. `` We'll denounce the agreement ...

But <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> described the negotiations as `` very serious'' and said they could lead to an agreement. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was expecting <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to issue the shutdown notice. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> wants a new agreement to be linked with progress on its `` national interests,'' a reference to longstanding regional disputes with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials want to avoid mixing regional politics in the negotiations. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies but have differences over Aegean airspace and seabed mineral rights as well as the military status of some Greek islands. They also have disputes over the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the Turkish army invaded in 1974 after a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Turkish Cypriots declared the northern third of the island an independent state in 1983.

The Democratic chairman noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was given responsibility for a task force to stop drugs at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders. `` Is n't it fair,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said, `` for voters to ask of the person entrusted with that special responsibility not only why are we losing the war against drugs, but also ... how could you not have known about drug thug <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dealing drugs and laundering money and running guns?'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> also noted that in March 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> released the report of the anti-terrorism task force, in which he said this country would offer no concessions to terrorists. Just one week earlier, the White House completed the first delivery of missiles to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has maintained that he had reservations about the Iran-Contra dealings and was excluded from decision-making on the matter. After <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s address, which anticipated the general election campaign in the fall, state party leaders were reminded by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign that the contest for the Democratic nomination is n't over yet. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, said Democrats can win the election in November only if they are unified after leaving the convention. And that could depend on not writing off <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> too soon, he said. `` You do n't have to be a professional politician to know that this type of thinking will allow you to win the nomination and lose the election,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. A somewhat different view came from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> A. Farmer, treasurer of front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign: `` History suggests that where a party has been able to identify a candidate early, he has a stronger chance of success in the fall,'' he said. `` And I think we do n't want to appear arrogant and we do n't want to appear cocky, but we're very pleased the way things are going. And if we can ... identify the nominee early, I think we can all begin to work together.'' Outside the meeting room, there was scattered talk of a vice presidential running mate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he'd heard home state Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s name mentioned frequently. As proof, he steered reporters to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> commented, `` I personally think that the best ticket from the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> standpoint is the Dukakis-Nunn ticket. I think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands a chance to carry <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, maybe with some other people -LRB- than <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> -RRB-, but I believe that would be by far the strongest ticket.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON> said he is pushing <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, who sought the party's presidential nomination in 1984. `` We think <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> balances the ticket in terms of his strength as someone experienced in defense issues, foreign policy issues, someone who's viewed as a moderate,'' he said. `` And certainly his record on important issues like civil rights is right there in the mainstream of the party.''

 Radical students on Friday scaled the walls of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, tossed homemade bombs at its buildings and shouted `` Yankee go home!'' in protests called to mark a bloody demonstration eight years ago. Witnesses said two people were injured in the attack which broke out shortly before noon. Seven attackers were arrested. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the bombs did n't damage the buildings and no Americans were hurt. Witnesses said students, some of them armed with steel bars, hurled six homemade bombs at police and over the embassy walls topped with barbed wires. Four of the devices, made from crude chemical explosives packed in soft drink cans, exploded with big bangs, sending about 100 people waiting for visa applications running for cover, witnesses said. A police officer was hospitalized with blast wounds on his neck and hands, they said. A student was also injured when he was hit by a policeman armed with an iron bar. Five students carrying one South Korean and two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags climbed over the 6-foot-high fence and ran around the embassy compound for several minutes, scattering leaflets. One student draped a South Korean national flag over his shoulder while other students tried to destroy two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags before being overpowered by police, the witnesses said. The students also tried to unfurl a placard which read, `` Drive out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, culprit of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> massacre,'' they said. The placard refered to an anti-government uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> on May 18, 1980, during which hundreds were killed. Friday's protests and others earlier this week were called to commemorate the bloodshed in that southern city. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the embassy incident lasted only about five minutes. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said five policemen and one student were injured. He added, `` There's no excuse for this kind of behavior. There is a political system now in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that provides for the expression of political views and participation in the political process.'' National police remained on full alert to cope with the demonstrations. Radical groups called for another march in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Saturday to denounce the government. Opposition church groups also called for peaceful protests. In other parts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and two provincial cities, hundreds of students staged demonstrations and marches, demanding the fall of the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the withdrawal of 41,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty. Many of the protests were peaceful but some turned into battles with riot police who retaliated with tear gas. In <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 400 students clashed with police, hurling firebombs and rocks. Eight students were arrested in <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, when they stormed an office of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered the attackers. Protesters have denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in demonstrations this week, charging that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports military dictatorship in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Demonstrators broke windows and hurled firebombs Thursday at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The center was seized by radicals in February who exploded several bombs that caused minor damage. Radical groups call for the overthrow of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government which they consider a continuation of its predecessor `` military dictatorship'' led by former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is distrusted by many Koreans because of the role he played in <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> narrowly won presidential elections in December after two opposition candidates ran and split the opposition ticket. On Friday, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government and the opposition failed to break a stalemate over clearing the way for talks between the president and opposition leaders. Both sides have called for negotiations between the two camps after last month's legislative elections in which the opposition took control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of the rival parties have met several times during the past week, but failed to work out details on opening the assembly. One major stumbling block has been <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s plan to include the head of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the summit with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and the two other main opposition party leaders, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>. The opposition leaders want only <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to meet with the opposition chiefs. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> used to include the chairman of his ruling party in summits, but opposition leaders, emboldened by their election victory last month, now object to the idea.

 A truck lost its brakes and rammed a restaurant Friday, injuring five people, including a policeman and the owner of the restaurant. `` The officer told me he was just sitting at the counter and he turned his head and saw the walls coming down and the cab of the truck coming at him,'' said Detective Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. The truck was traveling down a slight incline in heavy rain at 6 a.m. when the brakes failed and the driver swerved to avoid other vehicles. `` I looked to the front and saw the light pole, then saw nothing more,'' the driver, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said in a police report. `` Next thing I knew I was inside the building.'' The impact caved in the front wall of Frenchy's Restaurant. All of those injured, including Patrolman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Racine </PERSON> and owner <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON>, had been eating breakfast, police said. The crash apparently threw patrons into the counter and pinned Cote and <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, 37, managed to free himself and pull Cote and other patrons from the wreckage, police said. <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> was treated for leg injuries at a hospital and released. Cote, 43, was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Baystate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> with multiple injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. Cote, known as `` Frenchy,'' was one of four <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> restaurateurs to hand out vouchers to poor people for food at a nearby food bank. He also was known for slipping free sandwiches to those who looked like they could n't afford them, customers said. One person was admitted to Mercy Hospital in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in fair condition. Two other people were treated at hospitals for minor injuries and released. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was cited by police for having defective equipment and for not having a driver's license.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nationwide strike by journalists left Italians without their Friday morning and evening news broadcasts and no weekend newspapers. Journalists at the two major national news agencies <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> joined their colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> state television and radio offices as well as private broadcast disputes in the dispute. Newspapers wo n't appear Saturday or Sunday. The strikers have announced which days they will stay off the job this month, with newspapers scheduled to appear on Monday before disappearing again later that week for a few days before resuming publication. The `` newsless'' days are the latest in a series of protests led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to protest a breakdown in talks for a new contract. Italian publishers claim their labor costs would increase 70 percent in three years and that many newspapers would have to fold if they met the union demands. The unions dispute the figures, saying costs would rise 40 percent. Unions also want a clause that would prevent newspaper chains from using one central newsroom to provide national and international news for the group.

 Jurors in the case of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> decided Friday that the government can confiscate millions of dollars in real estate on a <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island, as well as several planes and other items owned by the convicted drug dealer. `` The island is wrecked. It is trashed. But that is not to say it would not be of some future value,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. The same jury had found the 38-year-old Colombian guilty on all 11 drug-trafficking counts Thursday after seven days of deliberations. Co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, was found guilty on one count of conspiracy. The issue of property forfeiture has to be considered separately under federal law. During Thursday's hearing on that, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> urged the jurors to allow the government to confiscate a large portion of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, an airstrip, a marina, three homes, a condominium and several planes. The island was <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s smuggling base from 1978 to 1980. `` If you prosecute a drug smuggler without taking his property, only part of the job has been accomplished,'' said <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> earned an estimated $ 250 million in the cocaine business. After 10 hours of deliberations the jury agreed Friday to all the forfeitures. But the question of how the government could take control of property in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> was not clear. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines when he is sentenced July 20. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> faces a maximum of 15 years and $ 25,000 in fines. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> after the jury was dismissed Friday that under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in existence at the time of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s extradition, his client might face a maximum of only 30 years in prison <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> disagreed, and the judge asked both sides to submit briefs on the question. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> refused again Friday to confirm reports that <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> _ who trial witnesses said received million-dollar bribes from <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> _ is his next target. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> and his aides have denied taking bribes, but have said they understand a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand jury is investigating the matter. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said he could not confirm the existence of such an investigation. Although <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was only on trial for smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> into deserted airstrips in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the government presented testimony that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> smuggled 18,000 kilos. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> has been identified as being one of the leaders of the violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> organization also reputedly headed by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year following a firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mansion. During the trial, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of drug trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern, high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> also is under indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for his role in the cartel and a sealed indictment in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but officials said it is unlikely that he can be tried for those offenses.

<HEAD>Honored, Popular Gifted Teacher Told She Must Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman honored recently as the Bay Area Gifted Teacher of the Year has been told by school officials she must retire next month so the district can save money. `` I feel they are dishonoring the teacher of the year,'' said <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 63, a teacher for 37 years. `` I understand the bureaucratic mentality. But what are we in education for? To treat people like robots?'' The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> has said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> must retire, although a state law would allow her to continue with the district's permission. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, district personnel director, said the system has about 550 teachers over age 59 earning top pay. The system is seeking their retirements to cut costs. <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' five years are up on a statewide reduced workload program that allows her to work half a year and receive half her $ 40,000 salary, yet still get full retirement benefits. Previous state law required teachers to retire after five years in the program, but last year the law was changed to permit school districts to extend the program to 10 years. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classroom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he asked officials to permit the extension for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, but they refused. However, schools Superintendent <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortines </PERSON> indicated Wednesday the district would be willing to negotiate. While most teachers use the reduced workload program as a way to ease into retirement, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a published author of fiction, essays and literary criticism, has started working on a doctorate in English at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> said Friday he does n't have a figure on how much money the district would save if all the teachers eligible to resign or participate in reduced workload program _ like <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> _ did so. He did say at least 25 teachers are in the reduced workload plan. Still, <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> said he will not make an exception for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` It's not that we're trying to be mean or cruel to her,'' he said. `` She's just one teacher. We have to treat all district employees equally. She wants her cake, and she wants to be able to eat it, too.''

The hijackers held 39 Americans captive for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on air piracy and murder charges but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refused to extradite him. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> will be tried before a juvenile chamber of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> state court, although he could be treated as an adult and receive the maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. The court will first try to determine if <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was under 21 years old during the hijacking. He first told investigators he was born June 13, 1964, but later said he was two years younger. Under West German law, juvenile courts can handle cases of defendents under 21. A juvenile court can impose a life sentence on an adolescent despite the age. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was found guilty by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court last month of organizing the kidnapping of two West Germans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to force the West German government to release his brother. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. The two West Germans were abducted within a week of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released in September. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> remains a hostage.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is about to get a taste of Cajun-style diplomacy as chef <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> carries his fiery recipes abroad and artist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> introduces a new audience to his haunting portraits of <LOCATION> Acadiana </LOCATION>. The two left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Friday for a 10-day trip to the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> that will overlap summit talks between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Seeds for the trip were planted in August, according to <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON>, when a Soviet delegation of scientists and public officials visited <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>'s restaurant, <PERSON> Lafitte </PERSON>'s Landing, in <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION>. It was, <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said, the delegation's first glimpse of rural culture in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This was not part of their typical American concept. We were the people living off the land,'' the artist said in a telephone interview as he prepared for his departure. The Soviets met <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> and sampled his food. `` I doubt the Soviets ever ate a better meal,'' <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> said later. The Soviets also met <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> and saw his art. `` I told them I paint the people of the land,'' he said. <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON>'s portraits of Acadians, often posed against the backdrop of moss-draped oak trees on bayou shores, captured the imagination of the Soviets. Soviet officials commissioned a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> portrait and <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> painted him in a yellow suit `` because yellow is a color of peace.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is depicted in front of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, with a bright sun shining and smaller figures of himself as a child, standing with his parents, in the background. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> portrait, and one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, will make the trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, along with about 20 <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> paintings depicting Cajun life. `` I tried to pick things that were kind of universal, one is a horse race, one is a story of a church in the aftermath of a hurricane, one is of a dog, my dog ... one is my little boy with the saying ` Kiss me, I'm Cajun' on his T-shirt,'' said the artist. <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> credits <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> with arranging the trip. <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> got help from the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> congressional delegation. Earlier this week, he said he had raised more than half the $ 130,000 he needed to cover the costs of food and expenses. He said, he wo n't keep any of the money, however. `` The Soviets will keep every nickel of revenue,'' he said. `` I hope <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> makes a better deal than I did.'' <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said he hopes both world leaders will visit the temporary <LOCATION> Cajun </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Lafitte </PERSON>'s Landing East, where he and <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> will display their artistry. `` We're pretty sure about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -LRB- paying a visit to the restaurant -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said. `` The president, we do n't know.''

Winners receive scholarships, trophies, medals and other awards. The competition, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, consists of 22 events for junior high students and 23 for high school. The students have already competed at the local, state and regional levels, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON>, event coordinator and science supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruction </ORGANIZATION>. The competition involves chemistry and physics, and tests student' laboratory skills and the application of scientific principles. Among the events will be an egg drop, which will require students to make a device to safely catch a raw egg dropped from a given height. The smallest device that can keep the egg from breaking will win the event. The purpose is to test students' knowledge of physics and the strength of materials The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has flown in about 40 seedlings from across the country for the tree identification competition.

 A woman walked into a second-grade classroom and opened fire with a handgun today, killing one child and critically wounding five others before barricading herself in a nearby home and shooting a young man, authorities said. The woman `` just walked into the classroom, went past the teacher who was there, indicated the gun was real and began firing at random,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>. The woman fled <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and went to a home several blocks away. A 22-year-old man was wounded when he tried to wrestle a gun away from the woman, but he and four other people in the house were able to escape, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, director of operations for police. The woman barricaded herself inside and rifle-toting SWAT team members in flak jackets with black daubs below their eyes surrounded the area in this affluent north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` It's extremely scary. She's just an ordinary citizen and she went through and set all this up. She is n't exactly stable,'' said <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> poice commander <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who was assisting at the barricade site. <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said a negotiating team was unable to establish contact with the woman. No motive for the shootings was immediately known. Police recovered a .32 - caliber handgun from the school bathroom and the woman was believed to also have a .22 - caliber gun and a third, unidentified weapon The woman was believed to have set fire earlier this morning to another house in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> where she worked as a housekeeper. A woman and several children who lived in the house escaped from the basement through a window, said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geier </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> police, who was also assisting <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> police. Patrolman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said the woman had opened fire without warning when she got to the school. The shooting ended around 11 a.m., <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. Parents rushed to the school and gathered outside, many of them weeping as they waited for word of their children. School officials said they would keep remaining children in school until the end of the day. <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said the woman barricaded inside the home used three different names, one of which was <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has an `` investigative interest'' in a woman of the same name, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wronski </PERSON>, but he declined to give further information. Police in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said they had been in contact with <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> police about a woman named <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, and said they had once arrested the 31-year-old woman. Four children were taken by ambulance to <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and two children and one adult were being treated at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, officials said. `` We have two girls and two boys. They're all critical, between the ages of 7 and 9,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Evanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` Three are in the operating room and one is in the emergency room.'' Three of the children suffered chest wounds and a fourth suffered a neck wound, <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said. One 8-year-old boy died at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaracchia </PERSON>. One other boy and a 22-year-old man were in critical condition, according to spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. Police cars were `` everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmont </PERSON>, who lives nearby. `` There've been fire trucks, ambulances.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> announced his resignation Friday after a `` gallant'' but unsuccessful attempt to keep the scandal-tainted organization intact. `` I came here in November to do all in my power to preserve and reorganize the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry and Christian retreat,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in a letter Friday to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Trustee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waites </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> official in <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> who presides over bankruptcy cases. `` It is now clear that much of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> must be sold to pay creditors,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 47, said. `` Although I have no desire to preside over the sale of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> assets, I maintain a strong commitment to the survival of the ministry and I hope to be of assistance to that end.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s resignation was provided for in a revised reorganization plan filed with the federal bankruptcy court Monday, but no time was specified. The filing outlined plans to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in Fort Mill and lease the property required to carry on its church and television ministry to a separate corporation. In the court filing, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had blamed the financial failure on a drop in contributions after the `` various scandals'' and warned, `` Because of past scandals and credibility problems, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and other television ministries are facing extinction.'' If the new reorganization terms are approved by the bankruptcy court, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> would stay on as initial president of the non-profit corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, that would run the church and cable television network. Later, a board of directors would determine who would serve as permanent president. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had previously served as vice president of marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to sending the letter to <PERSON> Waites </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> announced his resignation on the `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' TV show Friday and told viewers he is taking a week's vacation. He did not indicate whether he would continue as host of the show. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> could not be reached for comment later Friday. His office said he had gone for the day. He is the third television evangelist to resign as head of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 14 months. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, resigned in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal and turned the ministry over to the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, founder of the Moral Majority. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> resigned in October 1987 amid disenchantment with his leadership. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> approved <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s resignation and the appointment of M.C <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> as trustee to manage the day-to-day operations of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waites </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has served as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for accounting and operational affairs since Feb. 1 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, approximately $ 130 million in debt, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in bankruptcy court in June 1987. The ministry's assets are valued at $ 160 million. `` Dr. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> made a gallant effort to ensure the successful reorganization of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Waites </PERSON> said. `` Considering the problems which preceded him at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, and the troubled times for television ministries generally, the financial support of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s tenure was impressive. However, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> failed to raise enough money to make the initial payment of its debt as required under a reorganization plan filed in December. A modified reorganization plan filed Monday called for the trustee to liquidate the assets of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to the extent necessary to pay creditors. Two parties interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>, a sports entrepreneur from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who wants to build a professional baseball and basketball complex; and <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a California-based corporation with links to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. FEA will make a bid by the end of next week to take over the assets of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, according to various officials with the firm. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in a story published Thursday, that FEA offers `` the best hope on the table at this moment'' for him and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, to return to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> FEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> said the organization has not invited <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` to come back in any capacity.''

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Calls for Slower Star Wars Deployment Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should take a slower, more measured approach to the deployment of a Star Wars anti-missile defense system, a scientific advisory panel said in a report released Friday. The panel, a special task force of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the administration's plan of setting up even an interim `` Phase 1'' system all at once is too ambitious. `` In view of the technical, budgetary, political and arms control uncertainties surrounding the ballistic missile defense program, the panel recommends planning a number of steps in the technical development and deployment of a system ... rather than a single major action,'' the report said. The task force suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> start by deploying 100 ground-based interceptor rockets as allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, either outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, or at <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, N.D. The next step, it said, should be deployment of a new generation of `` space surveillance systems to improve our early warning detection and assessment of a ballistic missile attack ...'' That could be followed by deployment of new, short-range interceptor missiles around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with the next phase consisting of `` additional bases and ground-based interceptors and improved sensors to cope with counter-measures.'' Only then would a move be made to deploy defensive weapons in space, the panel said, with the final step being the addition of ground - or space-based lasers `` This approach would allow for more confident decisions and more flexibility in the face of uncertainties and would probably not require any more time in the long run,'' the task force contended. The science board task force was asked to take a fresh look at the Star Wars program early this year by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Its report was dated April 13 but was not cleared for unclassified release until Friday. The Pentagon, in finally releasing the study, stressed the findings were `` solely those of the authors and the submission of the report to the secretary in no way signals a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy with respect to the -LRB- Star Wars -RRB- program.'' The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative, is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons that could be deployed either in space or on the ground to automatically shoot down enemy nuclear missiles. Last September, then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> selected five Star Wars technologies for concentrated research, saying they would form the heart of an initial Phase 1 system. Among the five were some space-based as well as ground-based rocket systems. Ever since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has suggested the research results involving all five technologies would be evaluated sometime in the early 1990s and a decision made on constructing an initial system. `` We believe that the difficulty of supporting such a large decision all at once and of bringing all system elements to a satisfactory stage at the same time make the all-at-once plan very risky,'' the task force said. `` The stepped plan allows much more confident decisions and much more flexibility in the face of uncertainties.'' The Pentagon also should consider giving the highest priority to development `` of the sensors, processing and communications necessary'' to detect a nuclear attack and track and target incoming missiles, it said. Moreover, it said, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must resolve their dispute over what research the ABM Treaty allows. `` There is not a force acting on the SDI program that is more damaging or more insidious ...,'' the 11-member group wrote. `` Because the Soviets exploit ambiguities to the limit, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy that restricts us to activities that are unambiguously permitted by the treaty could seriously impair our security,'' the panel said. `` We believe the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should define a technically optimum testing and deployment program and should then adhere to that program except when treaty constraints unambiguously require it to do otherwise.'' The assessment requested by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> comes at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has been studying changes to the Star Wars research schedule caused by congressional budget cuts. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said earlier this month he would recommend a budget veto if the Star Wars request of $ 4.55 billion in fiscal 1989 was cut too deeply.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of shipping arms and military hardware to Afghan rebels and violating the agreement under which Soviet soldiers are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted ministry officials as saying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was not living up to the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement that prohibits it from assisting Afghan anti-government forces. In a separate commentary, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> criticized Pakistani Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> for allegedly inciting the rebels to military action. According to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media reports, the Afghan Foreign Ministry has complained twice this week to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is helping arm the Afghan rebels. Soviet Foreign Ministry officials said `` the shipping of arms and ammunition from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> into the territory of the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is an obvious violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements which entered into force on May 5,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Terms of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement mean <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` should discontinue the entire range of actions and activities to interfere in the affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' it said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has officially denied helping ship arms to the guerrillas but <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said Thursday that his country will observe the policy of `` symmetry,'' in which the guerrillas receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> arms the Marxist government. Soviet soldiers began withdrawing May 15 and the first convoy to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> crossed the border Wednesday. According to the agreement, all of the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers must be withdrawn within nine months. A Soviet journalist indicated Thursday that between 12,000 and 15,000 Soviet soldiers had been killed in fighting since Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. In its commentary, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> promised Soviet officials on a recent trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that his country would abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, but said on his return home Thursday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will continue to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aid the rebels. commentator <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Vavilov </PERSON> said. The Afghan peace process requires strict observance of all its terms, and `` any deviations, and ` free' and ` broad' interpretations of separate articles and clauses of the accords are intolerable,'' said commentator <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Vavilov </PERSON> said. He quoted Western press reports as saying unprecedented arms shipments were en route to the border of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where the Afghan insurgents have their bases.

It can use some light. `` By writing about AIDS, I am following a tradition of journalists who have written about their illnesses to help educate and, if blessed by finding the right words, to help others with the disease feel less alone,'' he wrote. `` Most of all, I am writing to say if we do n't want to be treated as a pariah, we have to stop acting like one,'' he said. During his tenure at the Star-Bulletin, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> fought for reporters' access to government records and meetings so they could keep the public informed.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Approving Radioactive Waste Compact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed federal legislation Thursday approving the Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact but warned the compact commission against attempting to enforce federal laws. In a statement announcing his signature, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said more than three quarters of the states have now entered compacts on low-level radioactive waste. He said such actions `` underscore this nation's commitment to take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> objected, however, to a provision of the bill assigning federal law enforcement responsibility to the commission without requiring that commissioners be appointed consistently with the appointments clause of the Constitution. `` Any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations would contravene the Constitution,'' the president said. `` While I hope that no such effort would occur, I expect the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to take note of and report to the attorney general on any such actions of the commission in this area.'' Under the compact _ which includes <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ the four states are required to ensure that there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the region's low-level waste, and that each state has equal access to it The commission created under the compact is empowered to set regulations on waste disposal and to impose fines or other penalties for violations. During consideration of the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that this part of the bill was unconstitutional because it applied to federal as well as state regulations. The department said enforcing federal regulations pursuant to a congressionally approved interstate compact constitutes the exercise of `` significant authority pursuant to the laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In order to do this, the department said, the compact members would have to be appointed by the president or by other federal authorities designated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as provided in the Constitution. Instead, the commission members are appointed by the states. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the governors of the compact states said they did not believe a constitutional issue would arise because `` the compact was never intended to apply to activities over which the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction.''

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Friday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed to join an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and reiterated his belief that peace would come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who returned home from a 13-day trip, said many problems remained with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> commuted the sentences of three Jewish underground members from life in prison to 15 years for staging a deadly gun and grenade attack at <ORGANIZATION> Hebron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. Three Palestinians were killed and 33 were wounded in the attack. The three convicted men _ <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Livni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharbaf </PERSON> _ were among 25 Jews arrested in 1984 and charged with planning or carrying out attacks against Arab targets. In other developments: _ <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and wounded a 15-year-old Palestinian during a demonstration in Jabaliya refugee camp, officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said The youth was shot in the hand after protesters threw stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. _ The army command said a border policemen was slightly injured by a knife-wielding <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> _ The army confirmed that 1,770 Palestinians are being held in administrative detention but the chief military attorney, Brig Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtresnov </PERSON>, denied the arrests without trial were a violation of human rights. During his trip, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where he attended the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He met with key Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>. In an interview at <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the Soviets agreed to an international peace conference which would not have the power to impose an agreement on the parties. However, he said, `` the argument with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not reached a conclusion.'' One major disagreement concerns <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s insistence on the right of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to self-determination. Both Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> reject establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told a group of supporters at the airport that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would always insist on three points: defensible borders; refusal to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and refusal to give up all of the territories occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. He said that during his travels, he tried to improve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image abroad `` Our situation is very difficult, especially with the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` I tried to present a balanced picture of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in front of the world.'' An Arab uprising broke out in the occupied territories on Dec. 8, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s strong measures to quash the insurrection drew world criticism. <PERSON> Shtresnov </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television in reporting on the detainment of Palestinians that the army closely examined each suspect before making the arrest and gave detainees the right to appeal. He said the detentions `` are in accordance with Israeli and international law.'' He denied charges that the military justice system had collapsed under the weight of the mass arrests which took place after the uprising began. <PERSON> Shtresnov </PERSON> conceded that there were problems initially in locating and identifying detainees, but said these were quickly solved and that computers were now being used to keep track of jailed Palestinians. <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemel </PERSON>, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinian prisoners, described the situation as `` a big mess.'' According to estimates by left-wing legislator <PERSON> Deddi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, 8,100 Palestinans are in jail after trial or pending trial, in addition to 1,900 other detainees.

<HEAD>US and Panamanian Negotiators Agree on a Noriega Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> next August and stay away until May 1989 and gives him a role in setting up a transition government beforehand, an administration official said Friday. In return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him, said the official, who has followed the negotiations but insisted on anonymity. The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments, allows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays and to go back permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement. He said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed reservations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said Friday that the vice president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes negotiating with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over the conditions under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might surrender power. `` The administration sources who have suggested that the vice president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are essentially correct,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Friday, but the vice president's aides would not say whether they discussed the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. The official who discussed the tentative deal also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recall deputy assistant secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> has spent virtually all of May in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> trying to work out an agreement. The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter said, `` If it gets accepted, it gives <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> everything he wants.'' The official said there were no assurances that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the agreement specifies. If the deal receives final approval, the official said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the transition government. Late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consulations. He said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s return does not mean any change in the process. `` The process continues,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, declining further comment. Associates of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have said in recent weeks that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense Forces.

<HEAD>Artsfest Opens 17-Day Run With Samba, Brass Fanfare</HEAD>

 The staccato beat of a samba band sounded in front of City Hall on Friday as this old Southern port unveiled the 12th edition of its <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> arts showcase. About 1,000 people looked on as schoolchildren sent dozens of colored balloons lofting into a pale blue sky. Then the musicians, in white slacks and metallic silver shirts, played a variety of drums and tambourines as they spun and danced on a platform stage. An hour later, the strains of a chamber music concert sounded at the nearby Dock Street Theater, the first of dozens of performances indoors and out throughout <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> over 17 days. The festival was founded by composer <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> and is named after the similar festival he founded in <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Friday's opening ceremonies also kicked off four days of events celebrating the bicentennial of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s ratification of the Constitution. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chairman of the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> board, noted people sometimes take the Constitution for granted and, in the same way, he would like to see the day when folks take the festival for granted. `` Right now, after 12 years, we are still a very fragile organization. We're still a fragile dream that becomes a reality for 17 marvelous days,'' he said. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the festival <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s `` great contribution to the nation and the world,'' adding `` we make this gift proudly and happily.'' But he said the festival `` is not given to this city. It is earned. And each year we must strive to earn it anew.'' During the course of the festival there will be 700 performances by 2,000 performers, including productions staged in <LOCATION> Piccolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, the city's companion arts festival, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, spoke briefly about the Constitution, saying that when the American experiment is measured against the ideals of its framers, it may have fallen short. `` But when you measure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against the other nations of the world, one can not but be amazed at how well it has worked,'' he said. The samba band was part of the cast of `` The Warrior Ant,'' a work by director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruer </PERSON> and composer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Telson </PERSON> which features over 50 dancers, musicians and actors and which will have its premiere during <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>. The festival's major opera, <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>'s `` Rusalka,'' which is seldom performed in this country, was to open Friday evening. <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> said later he feels the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> production, splashed with special effects, will be well received. `` It is beautiful work, very melodic ... the story has magic,'' he said. `` It is done very simply like a Japanese play. I think people will come from all over the country to see our production.'' Festival General Manager <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Redden </PERSON> said that over $ 1 million in tickets had been sold by the opening of the festival. The festival has a $ 3.7 million budget and about half that total is generated through earned income, he said.

<HEAD>Call for Boycott of `24 Horas' News</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A citizens' group is calling for a boycott of the major news program in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, accusing it of dedicating 97 percent of its time the presidential candidate of the governing party. The Active and Peaceful Civic Resistance organization distributed handbills calling on the public to stop watching 24 <ORGANIZATION> Horas </ORGANIZATION>, the nationally broadcast news program of the private <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> network. It said news of candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> dominated the broadcasts. `` The public has a right to choose with its preference or rejection of the type of information that it wants to receive,'' the handbills say. `` Let the public make it's decision and maintain it until it can be proven that these news shows have stopped being instruments of one party and have become true outlets of objective information,'' the handbills conclude. No one was immediately available at <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> offices to comment on the boycott call. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> deGortari, candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, is certain to win the July 6 elections over five minority party candidates. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermejo </PERSON>, who identified himself as Civic Resistance's training director, said in a phone interview Friday that the group is an independent non-partisan organization in 29 Mexican cities He said it formed in 1986 after controversial elections in the northern border state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, won by the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and considered a major setback to the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> reorganized its news programs in response to numerous complaints of biased coverage in the <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> elections, adding an evening news program that it said would emphasize provincial coverage and add additional viewpoints. Minority candidates have complained frequently that they are prevented from equal access to broadcast media and newspapers but President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders reject the accusation. Civic Resistance did not explain how it arrived at the figure of 97 percent of 24 <ORGANIZATION> Horas </ORGANIZATION>' programming being dedicated to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. A study done by the government's Channel 11 found that 24 <ORGANIZATION> Horas </ORGANIZATION> in February dedicated 67 bites, or 86 percent, of its campaign coverage to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview in this week's <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> magazine, <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> attributed the heavy coverage to `` the political ties that exist between the heads of this communications enterprise and the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and the insistence by the party that <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> provide coverage of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidate.''

<HEAD>DOT Probing Plans by Boston Airport to Sharply Boost Landing Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about local officials interfering in the free flow of air travel, announced an investigation Friday into plans to sharply increase landing fees for small aircraft at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Private pilots and some commuter airlines have complained loudly that the higher fees will amount to them being driven from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s major airport At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> asked the operators of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> to hold off on the landing fee increases, which are to go into effect July 1, until the department's investigation has been concluded next November. Despite the federal urging, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the state agency that runs the airport, said they plan to go ahead with the higher landing fees as scheduled. `` I do n't think it's appropriate to delay -LRB- the fee increase -RRB-,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, said the higher fee structure remains `` an essential first step in our overall program to improve service at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> for all <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> travelers. It should be implemented without delay and we're committed to a July 1 startup date.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in a statement called the <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> decision to proceed with the higher fees `` disppointing'' but said it is `` premature to speculate whether the new fee schedule will actually go into effect.'' The plan calls for base landing fees to be increased from $ 25 to nearly $ 100 with an additional charge pegged to the weight of the aircraft. This would sharply increase the fees required from operators of small, personal planes, business aircraft and commuters, while the costs to the major airlines in some cases would decline, critics complain. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> has been under intense pressure in recent months from groups representing private pilots and commuter airlines as well as some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> issue, which is seen as a maneuver by the airport's operators to drive away all but the scheduled airlines. Officials at crowded airports around the country are known to be closely watching the <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> case and what actions the federal government might take. Legislation designed to prevent the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> plan from being implemented has been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but its chances for passage seem slight this year. `` This is just the first foot over the line,'' Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said recently of the <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> proposal. `` There are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to follow suit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation specifically would examine complaints received about the higher fees at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. These complaints indicate that `` reasonable grounds exist to investigate whether <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION>'s action violates'' federal aviation laws, the department said. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said he would decide whether further action is necessary after the report is received sometime before Nov. 15. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> urged that the new landing fee structure not be implemented until the federal investigation is completed because of `` the potential impact'' and because the complaints about the fees `` raise questions involving national transportation policy.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he was perplexed by the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> request because a federal court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had already agreed to consider expeditiously a suit challenging the higher fees with hopes of a ruling before they are imposed. The court case is expected to give the issue a full review, he suggested.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Allows Force-Feeding Of Hunger Striker</HEAD>

 A Cuban prisoner who lost 21 -LCB- pounds while fasting for three weeks to protest his possible deportation is being force-fed, officials said. <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzo-Mart </PERSON> `` offered no resistance,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> federal correctional institution. `` He's being fed liquids intravenously.'' The feeding began Thursday following an order that day by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> acted after the chief of health programs at the hospital, Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanmore </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Manzo-Mart </PERSON> was `` increasingly dehydrated, and was experiencing progressive decline in his blood pressure.'' The doctor said the prisoner showed `` every sign of approaching a life-threatening situation.'' <PERSON> Manzo-Mart </PERSON> was one of 14 Cubans served with deportation papers at <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> April 29. He began the hunger strike two days earlier and was joined by another <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prisoner, although the second man later halted his fast. <PERSON> Manzo-Mart </PERSON> has appealed his deportation. Ten other Cubans have been served with deportation papers since Manzo-Mart and the others were notified last month. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said there are 77 Cuban detainees at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, all of whom were in prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, when rioting over deportation orders began last November.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view is that dropping the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a defensible bargaining position because he can not be extradited so long as he remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It contends that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s price for leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. According to a published report earlier this week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been calling on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5. President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25 but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated. `` We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` This appears to be part of that. The way to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need to be taken.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> had no comment on the negotiations.

 <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Council of the Twelve Apostles and a developer of the faith's extensive welfare program, died Friday at age 90. Next in line by tradition to become president of the 6.5 million-member church, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> died at his home of causes related to his age, said church spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFevre </PERSON>. `` The major missions of the church will forever reflect the kindliness, wisdom, gospel scholarship and faith of President <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>,'' said a joint statement issued by the church's governing First Presidency <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s funeral was scheduled for noon Monday in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. As the most senior member of the Twelve, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, by tradition, was the likely successor to the presidency of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> had he outlived President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture secretary. However, because of failing health, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> stopped participating actively in church affairs well before <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 88, became church president in November 1985. With <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, acting president of the Twelve for more than a year, becomes the group's official leader and probable successor to <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. Church presidents serve for life. Among <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s achievements was creation, as a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> leader, of a prototype for the church's welfare system, organized in 1936 to combat the impact of the Great Depression. The system, a network of farms, canneries and bakeries that provide employment and goods for needy church members, is based on a philosophy of self-help that has drawn praise from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Recipients are required to work at one of the enterprises or perform some other service in return for assistance. After <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was called to general leadership in the church in April 1941 as an assistant to the Council of the Twelve, he was named assistant managing director of the church welfare program, a position he held until 1959. He served as general chairman of the welfare committee from 1959 to 1963. He also was named in October 1951 to the Twelve, which assists the three-member First Presidency. He became a member of the First Presidency in 1972. `` He was a man of great warmth, love, kindness and patience,'' said <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, a former Mormon stake president. Former Gov. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s cousin, recalled `` a long and very gratifying association with him. He has been a great inspiration to me.'' <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> also was a cousin to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, the former governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president in 1968. During his career, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> supervised missionary efforts of the church in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In 1961, he formally organized in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the church's first Spanish-speaking stake, a geographical unit comprised of several congregations. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> had been a counselor to the late church Presidents <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> between 1972 and 1985. When <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> died at age 90 on Nov. 5, 1985, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, his successor, replaced <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> on the First Presidency and <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> became president of the Twelve by seniority. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was born Sept. 19, 1897, in <LOCATION> Colonia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where many Mormon families had settled after the church dropped its doctrinally based practice of polygamy in 1890. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> and his family were forced out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by revolutionaries when he was 14. They eventually settled in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. After serving in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1918, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> graduated in 1920 from <ORGANIZATION> Ricks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rexburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. He served three years as a missionary in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> before enrolling at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1926 and, later, a law degree. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> is survived by two sons and eight grandchildren. His wife, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, died March 9, 1979.

<HEAD>State Says No Tiny Cubicles at Martinique</HEAD>

 State officials said Friday they found no evidence that rooms in a welfare hotel had been divided into `` tiny cubicles,'' and said it was acceptable for two families to share a bathroom. Social Services Commissioner <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> rejected charges by the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of illegal and substandard conditions at the <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> Hotel in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. But a Legal Aid lawyer said <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> was wrong and pledged a lawsuit. `` To call a room that's 9-by-12 not a cubicle is no consolation to a family living in it,'' said the lawyer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>. `` State regulations require that rooms in which homeless families are placed contain private bathrooms,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. `` Even the commissioner conceded today that these rooms do not have private bathrooms.'' <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> ordered an investigation after Banks charged this week that as many as 80 rooms at the <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> had been subdivided into 9-by-12-foot cubicles and lacked sufficient furniture. City officials and a hotel co-owner said some two-room suites used in the past by one large family had been split up for two smaller families, and that bathrooms were shared legally. <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said the same Friday. `` We observed no evidence of new construction or of rooms being divided into tiny cubicles, and we observed no evidence of major infestations of roaches or rats.'' While some suites were split, with bathrooms shared, `` each family has a private entrance,'' <PERSON> Perales </PERSON> said. `` Each bathroom can be locked on both sides to ensure total privacy.'' Banks said the issue was not new construction and he had not alleged rat or roach infestations, but that families were being crammed into small rooms and forced to share bathrooms. The city houses 5,189 homeless families, of which 3,437 are in hotels and the rest in shelters. It recently announced a plan in which it hopes to have homeless families out of all welfare hotels in five years.

<HEAD>Fed Policymakers Opted for Higher Interest Rates in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top policymakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, worried about growing inflationary pressures, decided in late March to push interest rates slightly higher, according to a record of the discussions released Friday. The minutes of the March 29 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the credit tightening was approved on a 10-1 vote, with board member <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> voting no. The minutes said Ms. <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> objected to the tightening because she did not see a significant risk of higher inflation. It said she remained concerned that higher interest rates could have an adverse impact on economic growth, jittery financial markets and financially troubled banks. The minutes were the first official confirmation of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move to tighten interest rates in early April The move was noted at the time by economists, who said they also believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightened once again earlier this month. The closely watched federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other to make overnight loans, has moved higher and averaged 7.04 percent in the past week, the highest it has been since last October. A move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower the amount of money the banking system has available shows up first in an increase in the federal funds rate. With their own cost of money rising, banks are forced to hike the interest rates they charge their customers. After the second round of credit tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, major banks last week raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the first hike in this benchmark lending rate since before the October stock market collapse. The committee met again Tuesday and many analysts believe it left credit conditions unchanged, deciding to wait and see whether inflationary pressures continue building. Many economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to act again with another round of credit tightening, possibly as early as next month. Because of this belief, they are forecasting that various interest rates, including mortgage rates, will be headed higher in the months ahead. In the minutes of the March meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers noted that economic growth had been much stronger than was being predicted right after the Oct. 19 stock market plunge. They noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories were operating at the fastest pace in eight years while unemployment was dropping to the lowest levels of this decade. Several of the participants cited these developments as evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> needed to boost interest rates to `` prevent the business expansion from gathering excessive and unsustainable momentum that would lead to higher inflation. ... Moreover, action at this time might preclude the need for more substantial tightening later.'' At another point, the minutes said, `` The economy might well be near the point where faster growth in business activity would induce a higher rate of inflation, and in the view of several members there was a potential for a sharp escalation in prices.'' The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and six of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> regional bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. There is currently one vacancy on the panel. The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will not be released until after the next strategy session is held on July 6-7.

She then fled to a nearby home and shot a seventh person, police said. `` There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked over'' as the children panicked and attempted to flee or hid under desks, said <LOCATION> Glencoe </LOCATION> Patrolman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceglieski </PERSON>. Police believe the woman had set fire earlier in the day to another home eight blocks away where she worked as a housekeeper in this affluent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, according to Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geier </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> police. He was assisting in the arson investigation. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, director of operations for <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> police, identified the woman as <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` an investigative interest'' in her and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> said she had been arrested there March 14 on a charge of retail theft. He gave no further details. More than five hours after the initial shooting, the woman remained barricaded inside the home along a tree-lined neighborhood. Heavily armed police encircled the dwelling and a hostage-negotiating team was on the scene, but had not established contact with the woman. `` It's extremely scary. She's just an ordinary citizen and she went through and set all this up. She is n't exactly stable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Northbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commander <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who was assisting local police at the barricade site. `` The idea is to go in and take custody, not to kill her,'' he said. `` If you go storming in, there's going to be a gunfight and somebody might get shot _ either her or one of our officers. <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said the woman walked into the one-story, red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, shot one boy in a bathroom, then entered a second-grade class, `` went past the teacher who was there, indicated the gun was real and began firing at random.'' Police recovered a .32 - caliber handgun from the school bathroom and the woman was believed to also have carried a .22 - caliber gun and a third, unidentified weapon, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said the woman then ran through the woods from the school and entered the home, where four members of a family and their maid were present. `` Apparently, she just walked in and confronted the homeowners,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. `` The mother came running out and said, ` There's a woman in my home with a gun.' `` Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and fell over in the driveway,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. The son apparently struggled with the suspect, grabbed one of her weapons, and was shot in the chest, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. The father, maid and grandfather fled by side door, leaving the suspect alone inside, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. He said he believed the woman had three weapons and police had recovered two of them. <PERSON> Geier </PERSON> said the suspect was believed to have set fire to the home where she worked while a mother and her children were in the basement doing laundry. `` This woman set a fire in the house, trapping the people in the basement,'' he said. `` They escaped, got out, apparently without serious injury.'' The shooting erupted at about 10:45 a.m. CST and police said it lasted 15 minutes. An 8-year-old boy died at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaracchia </PERSON>. Another 8-year-old boy and the 22-year-old man shot at his home were in critical condition at the hospital, she said. The four children at <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were reported in critical but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>. They were identified as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Teborek </PERSON>, 8, who suffered a gunshot wound to the neck; <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark-Fisher </PERSON>, 8, wounded in the chest and stomach; <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, wounded in the wrist and chest; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trossman </PERSON>, 6, wounded in the chest. At the school, meanwhile, parents clustered in groups, consoling each other and attempting to make sense of the incident. `` I ran here all the way from downtown -LRB- <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, waiting outside the school later Thursday for his son to be released. `` I guess we're all vulnerable,'' he added. `` It' a sad commentary on society.'' Village Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON> said children were released in small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their safety. `` We're trying to keep the children calm and safely inside. We will release them, but not until it's entirely safe to do so,'' said <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>.

 An 11-year-old boy allegedly beaten by his father while an emergency dispatcher listened was taken into protective custody by child welfare officials who earlier decided to let him stay with his family. Police on Thursday criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' decision to let the boy go home despite a tape-recording rescue officials had of the alleged attack Hours later, the boy was taken into protective custody. An emergency dispatcher received a telephone call May 12 from the boy, who thought his father was having a heart attack. But the dispatcher soon heard the boy crying out and being beaten, police said. Calls to the 911 emergency line routinely are recorded. The boy's father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiddon </PERSON>, 40, has been charged with felony injury to a child and is free on bond. The boy was not seriously injured. After authorities went to the home where the call was made, the boy was taken away. But hours later, he was returned to his family, Children's Protective Services' officials said. The boy's initial return to his father came after a worker determined he would not be in a `` life-threatening situation,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. The worker did not listen to the recording before making the decision, she said.

<HEAD>US and Panamanian Negotiators Agree on a Noriega Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> next August and stay away until May 1989 and gives him a role in setting up a transition government beforehand, an administration official said Friday. In return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him, said the official, who has followed the negotiations but insisted on anonymity. The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments, allows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays and to go back permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement. He said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed reservations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said Friday that the vice president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes negotiating with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over the conditions under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might surrender power. `` The administration sources who have suggested that the vice president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are essentially correct,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Friday, but the vice president's aides would not say whether they discussed the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. The official who discussed the tentative deal also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recall deputy assistant secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> has spent virtually all of May in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> trying to work out an agreement. The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter said, `` If it gets accepted, it gives <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> everything he wants.'' The official said there were no assurances that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the agreement specifies. If the deal receives final approval, the official said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the transition government. Late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consulations. He said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s return does not mean any change in the process. `` The process continues,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, declining further comment. Associates of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have said in recent weeks that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense Forces. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view is that dropping the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a defensible bargaining position because he can not be extradited so long as he remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It contends that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s price for leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. According to a published report earlier this week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been calling on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5. President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25 but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions have contributed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic demise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apprehensions about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were heightened on Thursday when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employees and their families so that Panamanians will `` know the Gringos who are starving us to death.'' The supplement in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION>, a propaganda organ of the government, said the Americans `` think the walls of their embassy are impregnable.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the supplement has been `` noted with concern'' and that appropriate security measures have been taken. He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated. `` We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` This appears to be part of that. The way to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need to be taken.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> had no comment on the negotiations. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also refused comment except to say they were continuing.

<HEAD>White House Dismisses Report Soviets Tap Mrs. Reagan's Astrology
Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House dismissed as `` foolish'' a report Friday that the administration is trying to determine whether telephone calls between first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and her <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> astrologer had been intercepted by Soviet spies. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` If the Soviets wanted to monitor <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> phone calls to get information on the president, there are thousands of calls a day from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff of more significance -LRB- than Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s -RRB-. `` The most definitive information they're likely to get -LRB- from Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s calls -RRB- is how many pizzas are ordered by the first family,'' he joked. He said the column `` seems foolish to me.'' On a more serious note, he said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not have or use a secure telephone, designed to prevent conversations from being overheard. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> routinely places her calls through the White House switchboard. In addition, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has paid the astrologer an undisclosed amount of money out of her own pocket. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s comments came in response to a column by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> that said a White House official had been asked to quietly find out whether Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a secure line to astrologer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>. The Soviet consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> can listen in on long-distance microwave-transmitted telephone calls coming into that city, the column said. The Soviets would, however, have to recognize and select the calls from an immense volume of telephone traffic. Unnamed sources in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said they have been asked to conduct the investigation without telling President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for fear of offending him, according to the column.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Talks Falter Between Sandinistas And Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed Contra rebels have still not responded to a government proposal to extend the civil war cease-fire past the May 30 deadline, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinico </PERSON> said Friday. `` They still have n't answered a government proposal to call off for another month offensive operations,'' he said at a breakfast meeting with foreign correspondents. The leftist government and the U.S.-supplied rebels known as Contras have been exchanging charges on who's responsible for the faltering peace plan to end more than six years of war. Almost two months after the two sides signed the pact, they agree only on the desire to end the fighting. The government has warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the cease-fire is not extended after May 30 or if no progress is made. The Contras, meanwhile, are suffering from infighting, a move that favors the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. From the government's point of view, the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to self-destruct. Pro-Sandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the Contra bickering. At the same time, the government last weekend cautioned private radio station directors against broadcasting news that violates the public order law and warned of permanent suspension. Radio station directors called the warning a `` direct threat'' and described it as self-censorship that replaces the harsh media restrictions withdrawn by the government to comply with last August's regional peace plan. The problems surrounding the cease-fire plan appear to have started almost immediately after the March 23 signing. All of the meetings held since then have been marked by mutual distrust. The government announced on Wednesday a tentative agreement for a new round of peace talks to be held May 25-28, but the Contras immediately disagreed. The years of civil war have left deep scars in this nation of 3 million. Families are divided; sons have gone off to fight with one side or the other. If all had gone according to plan, the war would just about be over and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be well on its way to full democracy. A state security officer argued recently that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> already was a democracy. His comments came minutes after police hauled off several opposition political leaders who spoke to journalists near a building where workers staged a hunger strike. Because the cease-fire plan has not moved forward, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have not freed more than 3,000 political prisoners nor permitted the Contras to have a say in internal politics. Talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an impasse. The meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of support for the strikers. The government responded by saying it would consider whether future talks would be held. According to the cease-fire plan, the first measures should have been completed by April 15. In exchange, the Contra rebels would have gathered in agreed upon cease-fire zones and been permitted to receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization. The Sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food, medicine and clothes distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. But the Contras rejected that, saying the organization sympathizes with the government. `` The tactics used at the last meeting were almost to torpedo the agreement,'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` They put into question everything we had agreed upon.'' Meanwhile, thousands of rebel troops, according to sources, moved toward the northern border. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is providing supplies to the Contras through <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. A group of rebellious Contras has demanded the ouster of the top Contra military officer, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a former officer under the ousted dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, the Contra's main spokesman, said recently the talk of divisions was exaggerated. Nicaraguan Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Sunday that the Contra infighting puts into doubt future cease-fire negotiations. `` In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> the mercenary forces -LRB- the Contras -RRB- are on the verge of civil war,'' he said. `` The political heads that come here to negotiate have very little influence.'' The people, meanwhile, are war weary. The Sandinistas continue to draft youths into the military. The economy is in shambles. And farmers who fled the war zones in the northern mountains can not yet go home to plant.

 The nation's displaced workers are not receiving adequate job search assistance, training, counseling or benefits, a study group for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans reported Friday. The report by a task force of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said that of the more than 1 million American workers displaced annually due to plant closings or layoffs, more than one-third of them have extended periods of unemployment while some never return to the workforce. Of those who do return, almost one-half take pay cuts and more than one-third earn less than four-fifths of what they previously had earned, according to the study group which was chaired by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-I. The group recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enact a $ 980 million <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposal which would consolidate two current education and job training programs _ the Job Training Partnership Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. The new worker adjustment program is designed to serve an estimated 700,000 workers and would seek to eliminate costly duplication of effort. It would also provide substantially greater emphasis on actual retraining. The 69-page report said that poor publicity, a general lack of coordination among different federal assistance programs and a `` slow response rate'' when the programs have actually have been implemented `` have plagued the delivery and quality of assistance'' to displaced workers. Projections for the next 15 years, it said, indicate that millions of Americans are not only ill-prepared for existing jobs but will have even more difficulty finding and holding jobs in the future `` unless the work force is retrained and continuously prepared for marketplace change.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is faced with the creation of a growing underclass, increasingly made up of former manufacturing and industrial workers without the skills to enter -LRB- the work place -RRB-,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conference is an organization made of all 46 Republican senators. In addition to <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenburger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> were members of the task force which held three field hearings of March and April of last year and conducted interviews with dislocated workers, union and business representatives, service providers and program directors.

<HEAD>Protesters Disrupt Opening Of Georgia GOP Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Disgruntled Republicans, upset over the disqualification of 968 would-be delegates, disrupted Friday's opening session of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP convention by chanting `` no, no, no'' and parading around the hall carrying placards Many of the protesters were supporters of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy, but there were also supporters of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Meanwhile, party officials refused to register any of the estimated 1,600 people attending the convention at the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. State Republican Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> told the crowd the party was barred from officially seating any delegates until the credentials committee had issued its report on the disqualified delegates. `` I ca n't proceed with registration until I know who is a delegate,'' he said. `` I am acting on the advice of counsel. I do n't intend to register anybody.'' The credentials committee began the court-ordered review process Friday morning, just hours before the convention opened. Supporters of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy boycotted the review process, however, saying they would attempt to seat their own delegates. <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> called the convention to order about 2 p.m. amid boos. On two occasions when party leaders were speaking, many of those on the floor of the convention hall stood up and shouted. The dispute was over a May 11 letter sent by the credentials committee to 968 of the delegates elected at county conventions, informing them they had been disqualified as delegates to the state convention. Most were rejected because local party officials had not provided evidence that the county conventions were advertised in newspapers. Many of the disqualified delegates charged that that technicality had never been used before. A major order of business at the two-day convention is the election of the final 18 of the state's 48 delegates to the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. All 48 are committed to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the first two ballots at the August convention because the vice president swept <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential primary. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters are seeking to attend, hoping they can influence selection of the vice presidential candidate and the party platform.

 The Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia claimed Friday it had foiled an attempt by guerrillas of the pro-Iran <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group to trade a Western hostage for arms from a Christian militia. The claim came as Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, battled for the 15th day for control of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s slums. Police said rival Palestinian factions fought house-to-house in nearby <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> refugee camps. In the Palestinian fighting, police said one guerrilla was killed and 36 people were wounded in combat that first flared in <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh and then spread to <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>. They said guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction flushed out Syrian-supported dissidents of Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> group from their five bases in the sprawling shantytown near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. The dissidents shelled the camp with long-range artillery in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a bid to blunt the assault by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalists, police said. They was no immediate report of casualties. Amal politburo member <PERSON> Atif </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told 10,000 Shiites in the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Zahrani </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> had worked out an arms-for-hostage deal with the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia Amal foiled the alleged swap `` after we found out about contacts between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Lebanese Forces,'' he said without elaboration. Most of the 18 Western hostages held by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions allied with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are believed held in the embattled southern slums. Militia officials declined to identify the hostage or say how the reported trade was thwarted. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Lebanese Forces denied the Amal claim. `` It's an attempt to distort <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s image,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who refused to be identified. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Adwan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forces </LOCATION> political head, said: `` <PERSON> Atif </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s baseless accusations constitutes a cheap attempt to cover up <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s military losses in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Friday, but told reporters his visit was `` not specifically for the hostages.'' The Syrians have been helpful in the past in securing the release of foreign hostages, `` but I do n't want to be in the position of telling the Syrians what to do,'' he stressed. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing Lebanese forces are bitter foes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. The only thing they have in common is that both oppose Syrian efforts to control <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has seized control of most of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in recent fighting. But the Iranian-backed fundamentalists are penned up in the slums by the Syrians on three sides and the Christians to the east and apparently unable to get weapons and ammunition in. Amal remains entrenched in the <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district on the northern edge of the shantytown, where they have surrounded a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Hajjaj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. A senior Amal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the arms-for-hostage exchange was to have taken place there. The Lebanese Forces hold the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> district of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON>, east of <PERSON> Hajjaj </PERSON> street. The two districts have been separated by a 25-yard-wide no-man's land since the civil war broke out in 1975. Police said the two factions fought with howitzers and mortars Friday. Nine people were killed and 42 wounded in the fighting. That raised the toll since May 6 to 253 killed and 814 wounded. The Syrians have deployed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks along the southern, western and northern edges of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since Sunday, but have made no move yet to push into the labyrinthine slums to end the fighting and aid Amal, its battered proxy. Syrian officers have said this was to give political efforts a chance to end the fighting, but those efforts have failed. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> reported that Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, the Syrian intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s entry `` into the southern suburbs is inevitable.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s principal Arab ally in its war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> has been alarmed by Iranian efforts, through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest Moslem sect In a change of stance, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual guide, voiced cautious approval of a Syrian deployment. `` The entry of Syrian troops is a possibility. No one is thinking of confronting the Syrians,'' he said. A Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> clergyman arrived Friday seeking to deliver a petition from a Christian human rights group to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, representative of the Seattle-based Friends in the West, said he hoped to hand the petition signed by 40,000 people from various countries to <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 A top aide to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked executive privilege Thursday when asked what was said about narcotics when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1985 in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office. During a three-hour deposition, Col. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, deputy national security adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, did answer some questions posed by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, the attorney for a group of plaintiffs in a private civil lawsuit. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he had prepared a memorandum to set up <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Dec. 16, 1985 meeting with Ambassador <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> wanted to discuss a situation involving <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, who had been ousted as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president by military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the subject of narcotics, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> testified in the sworn deposition that he was present at the meeting along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top national security aide, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, and an official from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But when asked what <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the subject of narcotics, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, objected and instructed his client not to answer on grounds of executive privilege. <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> later said the privilege applies because it covers conversations of the president and vice president. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> then asked <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> whether narcotics was discussed at all in the meeting. `` I do n't recall specifically whether they were or not. I could make that assumption, but I will not state it as a certainty,'' he said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he had since searched for any memorandum summarizing the meeting, but could find no such document. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he had only a vague knowledge of narcotics issues involving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at that time. `` There were vague, unsubstantiated rumors around that ... people in the PDF -LRB- <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces -RRB- were facilitating trafficking of drugs,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported May 8, citing administration sources it did not identify, that <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the 1985 meeting on allegations that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in the drug trade. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> has since denied that he could have given clear indications of <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>'s drug involvement at that meeting, saying he himself did not have any solid evidence at the time. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly denied that he was aware of any clear evidence of such involvement by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before this February, when the Panamanian general was indicted by two grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges. His Democratic opponents in the presidential campaign have questioned how much <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug involvement. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s statements came during a deposition for a $ 24 million damage and racketeering lawsuit charging that a group of defendants _ including some involved in the Iran-Contra affair _ supplied the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels with weapons in trade for cocaine. The suit also accuses the group of planning the May 1984 bombing that injured maverick rebel leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Quake Fears Spur Exodus of Cambodian Refugees from Southern
California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A recent powerful earthquake and an unfounded prediction of a devastating temblor have spurred many Cambodian refugees to leave <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, members of the community said Friday. Fears have been widespread in the community since a quake Oct. 1 that measured 5.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, and were revived by recent publicity about a purported prediction by the 16th-century seer Nostradamus that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would be destroyed by a temblor. `` How many people are leaving for this I really do n't know. But people are talking about it. People are leaving, are scared,'' said <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Pok </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, a center for immigrant education and vocational training that serves about 10,000 people a year. One reported estimate put the number of Cambodians who have fled at 2,000. `` My real gut feeling _ 1,000 may be more realistic,'' Than said. An estimated 35,000 Cambodian refugees live in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, mainly in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. It is the largest Cambodian community in the nation. Most came after the Vietnamese invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1979, Than said. Until last October there had been no significant earthquake or other natural disaster in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area in the time since the Cambodians arrived. The reaction to the October quake is based in Cambodian culture, Than said. `` The Cambodian culture is a mixture of Buddhism, <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and animistic belief. They believe in the super -LRB- natural -RRB- power, the storm, the earthquake, the fire, the flood. So this theory is in the back of their mind. They think they can not control; they just fear,'' he said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said that 343 people of <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> ethnicity have been added to the welfare lists since last October. `` That is unusual growth,'' he said, although he did not know whether quake fears were behind the influx. <PERSON> Namany </PERSON> <PERSON> Keam </PERSON>, operator of the private <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Translation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said she did not know anyone who had moved, but there has been a great deal of talk about people leaving to join friends and relatives in such places as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Everybody is scared. Some of them just move. ... They'd rather go to the cold states than the earthquake state,'' she said. Impetus to the exodus apparently also came from publicity about a video, `` The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which a filmmaker interpreted a vague prediction by <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> to mean <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would be destroyed by an earthquake in May. The purported prediction was dismissed both by scientists and experts on Nostradamus. `` Cambodian culture really believes that ... somone can tell the future,'' Ms. <PERSON> Keam </PERSON> said. `` When they talk about the fortune teller in the newspaper and TV, they really believe.'' Than agreed that such fears can be triggered by things such as children being put through earthquake drills at school and the frequent discussion of earthquake preparedness in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` This kind of thing, unless you make an effort to communicate to people, they're never going to understand it,'' he said. Than said he was n't certain whether the refugees were leaving permanently. <PERSON> Vora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanthoul </PERSON>, associate executive director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> office in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, said, `` There are some fears around. To actually leave because of that fear, there's only a small percentage. He cautioned that exact estimates would be unreliable because there is also migration north for economic reasons. `` People are moving. Quite a few businessmen are going up there because of the opportunity, because <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, as far as the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> population, is growing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Negiotators Compromise on New Prescription Drug
Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reached tentative compromise Friday on a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that could clear the way for final votes on a catastrophic health insurance bill next week. Rep. <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., told reporters the drug issue was the most complicated item separating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members of a conference committee Asked when the committee would have a final compromise ready for submission to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Start </PERSON> said, `` I hope next week.'' But Stark noted that several other issues are outstanding, including the precise way flat and sliding-scale premiums will be imposed on the 31 million Medicare beneficiaries to pay for additional benefits and whether participation in the expanded coverage will be mandatory or voluntary. The tentative drug compromise being recommended by an eight-member working group to the full conference committee calls for the new benefit to be phased in starting Jan. 1, 1991. Medicare does not now cover any outpatient drugs except for a handful of particularly costly medications such as anti-rejection drugs for transplant recipients. Under the recommended compromise, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> would pay half the cost of prescriptions in 1991 after a $ 600 deductible is met. Medicare would pay 60 percent of drug costs the following year and 80 percent in subsequent years _ but still only on that portion that exceeds $ 600 a year. The premiums charged beneficiaries to cover the new benefit would be indexed each year to cover the cost of the program, which is expected to grow each year. The initial level of those premiums and details of the indexing are to be worked out in subsequent negotiations of the full conference committee. The full conference also has to resolve several other, albeit less thorny, differences. However, there is broad support for the legislation and negotiators expressed confidence at their first public meeting earlier this month that a compromise would be reached quickly. Both bills passed their respective houses by overwhelming margins and are patterned after the basic framework proposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Neither measure makes provisions for long-term nursing home care under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, but would shield <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries against financially crippling out-of-pocket doctor and hospital bills. While the cap on how much beneficiaries would have to pay is one of the issues still to be resolved, it is expected to be between $ 1,043, the latest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> offer, and $ 1,370, the latest <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer. Medicare would pick up all hospital and physician costs for a beneficiary after the cap is met in a given year. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays full costs of only 60 days of a hospital stay in a given year, minus a first-day deductible, and pays only 80 percent of doctor bills, no matter how high they range. On the cost side, the major disagreement is how to distribute the additional premium <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees will have to pay _ particularly the so-called supplemental premium that is tantamount to an income tax surcharge for the estimated 60 percent of retirees who would be subject to it. Each beneficiary will have to pay a flat monthly premium for the catastrophic coverage, but about 40 percent do not have enough income to make them also subject to the sliding-scale supplemental premium that will be based on their ability to pay and be collected through the income tax system.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s once-poor presidential campaign raised and spent as much as front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as they battled in last month's crucial Democratic primaries, records filed Friday showed. With the expensive races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> still ahead, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> each entered the month of May with $ 1 million-plus bank accounts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> actually spent more than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during April, but a good chunk of his spending _ $ 804,570 _ went to pay off loans, according to the financial disclosure report he filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reported spending $ 4 million during the month, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent $ 3.7 million as they dueled across such expensive states as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the best financed Democrat throughout the campaign, has borrowed no money. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took out another $ 624,000 in loans in April, for a total of $ 1.4 million in loans since the beginning of the year. Spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schade </PERSON> said the loans borrowed and repaid last month reflected a rotating line of credit the campaign has for operating expenses. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended the month with $ 1.1 million in cash on hand and $ 548,741 in debts, his report showed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had $ 1.4 million on hand, and $ 699,906 in obligations. On the Republican side, certain nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended April with $ 4 million in cash on hand after raising $ 2 million for the month, including $ 1.2 million in matching funds, and spending $ 1.7 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported taking out a $ 20,000 loan for general election campaign start-up costs. Television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who suspended his campaign last week, showed a debt of $ 1.4 million at the start of this month, after raising $ 1.1 million, with $ 341,523 of that in federal matching funds, and spending $ 1.1 million during April. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had only $ 29,473 in the bank. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued his steady upswing in fund-raising, with total receipts of $ 4.2 million, including the loan and $ 1.7 in federal matching funds, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took in $ 3.4 million, including $ 1.1 million in matching funds. In receipts from contributors, the two remaining Democratic contenders were almost dead even, each taking in about $ 1.9 million. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has had many high-dollar months and has proven a consistent fund-raising power, the April numbers reflect the sophistication of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s fund-raising arm. During the first half of April, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was riding high on the success he had achieved with his upset <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> victory and wins in other states. But he subsequently suffered heavy losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in state after state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign said he has raised $ 23.6 million from the start of his campaign through the end of April, including $ 6.8 million in matching funds, which are based on the amount a candidate raises on his own. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign total through April was $ 11.7 million. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign is penny-pinching these days so it can spend enough on the expensive June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary and still have enough money for the summer convention operations without surpassing the $ 27 million maximum set by federal law. The rules say candidates who receive federal matching funds can spend no more than $ 23 million on their primary campaigns, plus another $ 4 million for fund-raising costs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> through April had spent $ 18 million against the $ 23 million cap. But current spending is budgeted `` to the dime'' so the campaign will leave itself with money to spend on the party convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this July, said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said in a statement that the campaign has received money from 80,000 individuals whose contributions averaged $ 170 each. He said his candidate's fund-raising success reflects an `` excitement and enthusiasm Americans feel'' toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> plans to convert its largely ceremonial presidency into an elected post with executive powers and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> seems likely to seek that role after he retires as prime minister. Confirmation that an elected president is in the works was made in parliament Thursday. Legislation described as `` only a very preliminary draft which needs considerable revision and improvements,'' has been prepared, said <PERSON> Phua </PERSON> <PERSON> Bah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a senior parliamentary secretary. <PERSON> Phua </PERSON>'s brief statement was a written reply to a question submited by <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, the only opposition member of parliament. It ended four years of speculation that basic changes were planned in the way this bustling island republic is governed. The president is now named by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to a four-year term. Wee <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wee </PERSON>, 72, a former diplomat and journalist, has been president since 1985. In his national day address in 1984, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the constitution might be changed to prevent any future government from squandering <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s ample reserves. He said an elected president with veto power over access to these assets might be the answer. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has for years said he would like to follow the example of many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate leaders and step down at 65. He reaches that age on Sept. 16. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, 46, who was named first deputy prime minister after the 1984 elections, is positioned to succeed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The prime minister's eldest son, Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien </PERSON> <PERSON> Loong </PERSON>, 36, is also regarded as eventual prime ministerial material. A retired army general, he entered politics less than four years ago. Observers here say the elder <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> would be a natural candidate for the presidential post. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> became prime minister in 1959 on a wave of anti-colonialism and with the help of Communists, whom he later purged. But steady economic growth has endeared <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to a population of 2.6 million that enjoys one of the highest living standards in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. On Friday, the island republic's Home Affairs Ministry said a prominent <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> lawyer arrested for plotting subversive activities admitted he had links with a recently expelled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat. The arrested lawyer, 59-year-old <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Seow </PERSON>, was taken into custody earlier this month under <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s tough Internal Security Act for questioning into possible foreign interference in domestic affairs. At the time, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> also ordered <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, a first secretary in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s political section, out of the country for allegedly urging people to run for public office against the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I found <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> -RRB- to be a pleasant person. I maintained cordial relations with him as he had been supportive of my political intentions, which I found most encouraging,'' <PERSON> Seow </PERSON> said in a sworn declaration made public by the Home Affairs Ministry on Friday. The government also called on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reprimand two of <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> superiors, who were not publicly named. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied the allegations and expelled <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chua </PERSON>, a first secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, on May 11.

 The 8-year-old boy accused of holding cocaine for a dealer making sales in his neighborhood said Friday he has worked for dealers for two years and spends the money he earns on candy and ice cream. The boy said he made $ 5 to $ 30 a day as a `` stash,'' holding drugs while the dealers made sales. `` It kills people,'' he said, when asked if he knows what cocaine does. `` I'm gon na stop doing it.'' In the last 10 years, police say, 10 children under age 10 have been arrested for drug offenses. The boy's mother said drugs are rampant in the area, a poor neighborhood of row houses west of downtown. His back door faces a debris-filled alley and the lot at the end of the block is littered with empty liquor bottles, clothes and a broken television. When he came home from school Friday, he announced he had read a book and learned some new spelling words. `` I done all my work. I done my spellin' words. They's hard,'' he said. The boy was arrested Wednesday and charged as a juvenile with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He allegedly held 14 vials of cocaine, worth about $ 280, in his sweatsuit while <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, allegedly made sales a few feet away. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and employing a minor to distribute narcotics, police said. He was being held Friday without bail. Police have withheld the boy's name because of his age. He is a second - grader at <ORGANIZATION> Bentalou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and has a learning disability, school officials said His 28-year-old mother, who is unemployed and has three other children, said she would punish her son by prohibiting him from watching television or playing outside all summer. `` Everybody is going to put the blame on me, and it's not my fault,'' she said. `` I'm not out there seeing what these guys are giving him. `` I'd suspected it. He'd come in the house with money. When I'd be taking him outside, older guys would be calling to him I'd say, ` Y' all giving my kid drugs? They said no. I never found drugs on him. `` I asked him, ` Where'd you get the money?' He'd say, ` My friend give it to me.'' Juvenile authorities are to determine if the boy should remain with his mother or be sent to an institution or foster home. His father was killed in a drug-related shooting several years ago, police said, and the boy was a witness to a drug-related killing three years ago, his mother said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winterling </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Bentalou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said the boy is popular with teachers and pupils. `` He's made a lot of progress this year. He's become proud of himself and proud of his work,'' she said in an interview Friday. The family moved from a public housing project two years ago because of drug dealing and because two of the woman's older children were molested. At <LOCATION> Bentalou </LOCATION>, teachers tried to keep the attention about the arrest to a minimum, Ms. <PERSON> Winterling </PERSON> said. `` We have very young children here,'' she said. `` This morning we wanted to make it as normal as possible. He has been through enough.''

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` owes the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people an explanation'' of why it was doing business with Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. At a news conference at the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want an explanation. ... Unless and until we have that explanation, I'm not going to be satisfied.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or `` somebody in the administration'' should tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` who it was who thought it was in the interests of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and this country that we do business with somebody who was a known drug peddler and who was suspected of murder.'' Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an administration official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by August and stay away until next May. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to drop federal drug indictments against him, said the official, who has followed the negotiations. He commented only on condition he not be named. On another subject, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration and finance secretary, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, announced new proposed spending cuts, efficiency steps and revenue plans designed to improve the bottom line of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' $ 11.9 billion state budget proposal for next year by $ 217 million. Faced with a shortfall in tax collections, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is proposing to cut $ 92 million from expansions he had previously proposed in dozens of individual programs. He also signed off on a hoped-for $ 47 million in savings through improved government operations. He also hopes to raise millions more through bottle deposits and a higher tax on cigarettes. In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> addressed a rally in a plaza in front of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament as hecklers stood on the steps of the church holding signs denouncing his stance in favor of a right to abortion. `` Real Greeks do n't kill babies,'' read one sign. As he spoke, hecklers chanted, `` Baby killer, baby killer.'' But the chants were largely drowned out by the loudspeaker system. Asked about his position on abortion at the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't favor abortion. I do n't think it's a good thing. I do n't know anybody who does.'' However, he said that he believes it is a matter of an individual woman's choice, to be made according to the dictates of her conscience. He said he understood people who had a different view but wished `` they could keep the decibel level down.'' Earlier Friday, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he expects to hold regular meetings with rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has stepped up his criticism of party rules as his presidential hopes dimmed. `` We meet,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after an appearance at an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high school. `` We met Sunday, we'll be meeting regularly.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been pressing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders to give him a greater share of the votes of so-called `` super delegates,'' the party and elected officials given automatic delegate status at the nominating convention in Juy. Most of those delegates have been falling in line behind the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy, prompting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to complain that he is receiving a disproportionately small number compared to his primary and caucus showings. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday he expected to meet soon with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss strategy and issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with less than three weeks before the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, one of four that day. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expects to collect enough delegates on the final primary day to put him over the 2,081 delegates needed for a convention majority. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took questions from the predominantly black student body of the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the very first was, `` Is this a token visit?'' When the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor appeared puzzled by the question, the student said she wanted to know if his visit was a rare appearance in a black neighborhood. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has made few appearances in black communities and has largely conceded the black vote to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, replied, `` I've been in black schools for years ... I'm here because this is a very, very special place with a great reputation.'' One student asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he was interested in running for vice president on a ticket heaed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> grinned and said, `` I'm not interested in the vice presidency.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, told the students how she became dependent on diet pills and urged them to use her example to stay away from drugs and alcohol. After the question-and-answer session, students had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> don a baseball-style jacket and then led him and his wife onto a stage, which was set up for a performance of the musical `` Grease.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife sat on stools at center stage while students performed `` Summer Loving,'' a song from the show. The students tried to get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to wear sunglasses. At first, he pushed them back on his forehead, then finally took them off and handed them back.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Friday making it easier for hundreds of thousands veterans to receive disability benefits for exposure to radiation from the World War II atomic blasts in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or from nuclear test explosions. Ordinarily, veterans claiming disability benefits must prove the disability was connected with their military service. The bill bypasses this requirement for a limited group of veterans with respect to specified diseases. It applies primarily to cancer of various organs. The Office of Management and Budget said more than 300,000 veterans would be affected by the legislation, and the first-year cost was estimated at $ 65.6 million. The legislation affects veterans who served with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces occupying <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It covers the period from Aug. 6, 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, through July 1, 1946. Also covered are veterans held as prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during World War II, or who served on active duty in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> immediately following such internment if they were subject to exposure to radioactivity comparable to that of the veterans who served at <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. The bill also applies to veterans who participated in tests involving atmospheric detonation of a nuclear device. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, called the new law `` a long overdue step toward taking care of a very large and serious problem.'' `` Deadly legacies of radiation exposure hang heavily over every American community,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. The legislation would apply only to ailments that manifest themselves within 40 years after the veteran's last possible exposure to the specified sources of radiation or, in the case of leukemia, 30 years afterward. This period already has passed for veterans who served in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> or were prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Enactment of this legislation does not represent a judgment that service-related radiation exposure of veterans covered by the act in fact caused any disease, nor does it represent endorsement of a principle of permitting veterans to receive benefits funded through veterans programs which bear no relationship to their former military service,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Instead, this act gives due recognition for the unusual service rendered by Americans who participated in military activities involving exposure to radiation generated by the detonation of atomic explosives. The nation is grateful for their special service, and ... -LRB- this bill -RRB- makes clear the nation's continuing concern for their welfare.

 The president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> told Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in December 1983 of allegations that officials in his country were connected to drug trafficking, but he also told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the charges were untrue, a top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide present at the meeting said Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, said that then-Panamanian President <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Espriella </PERSON> mentioned the allegations at the end of a meeting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, now the de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, attended the meeting, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. `` The vice president said he had not been aware -LRB- of the charges -RRB- or he would have raised them'' with de la Espriella, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified in a sworn deposition for a private civil lawsuit. `` We did nothing to follow that up'' after returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interdiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> also testified that he was aware at the time that the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been helpful to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in getting military supplies to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he had no reliable information connecting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the drug trade until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February on drug charges by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s testimony came during a day-long deposition as part of a $ 24 million suit by the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal policy group, charging that a list of defendants, some of whom were involved in the Iran-Contra affair, supplied the Contras with weapons in trade for cocaine, and conspired in a failed attempt to assassinate a maverick Contra field commander, <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, voiced repeated objections throughout the day to the questioning, charging that it ranged far from the subject matter of the suit and was being done for political purposes. `` I think it's quite clear you have some other agenda in mind,'' he said at one point to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Withey </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiffs. On Thursday, another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, Col. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, invoked executive privilege and declined to answer when asked during a similar deposition what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, discussed about narcotics at a Dec. 16, 1985, meeting. When <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> about the same meeting on Friday, he agreed to discuss it but said his recollection was not specific. `` I think we came away from the meeting with Ambassador <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> with the sense that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a growing problem _ politically, militarily and possibly in the drug area,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified. But he said any drug problems involving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` were not highlighted'' by <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>. Later in the day, <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>: `` The fact that General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may have had some involvement in the narcotics problem, that was coming out of the December'85 meeting at that time, is n't that correct? <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> responded: `` It would have been part of the general picture of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a political problem, as corruption, and as a general policy problem, yes.'' But talking with reporters later, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he did not recall any discussion of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drug trafficking. `` I am saying that narcotics as a problem in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was part of the agenda of the meeting. ... There was no discussion of any direct connection between that and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Earlier this month, <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> denied a published report that he had briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on allegations that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in the drug trade. By the time of that meeting, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was chairman of the president's anti-narcotics task force. It was `` certainly in the realm of the possible'' that <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was aware of charges that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was linked to drugs, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said, in part because he knew of similar charges that had been made against a brother of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s predecessor, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties in 1978. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was now in power, and it was possible to conjecture that he'd become involved in some of that,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> also testified that a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> briefing paper would have been prepared for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> outlining the background of the ambassador's concerns, and that the paper would have been placed in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s briefing book to prepare him for the meeting. That document is among papers sought by the plaintiffs in the suit, but which have not been turned over by the government. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said, the vice president's office searched for documents relating to past Bush-Noriega dealings The search turned up `` a couple'' of documents from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cable prepared after the 1983 meeting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said.

 The cocaine-smuggling conviction of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> has heartened the front line in the drug war, but officials acknowledged Friday they are far from destroying the violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. In the past month alone, drug agents have seized 3.7 tons of cocaine in a single shipment of lumber, taken two tons from a speedboat making a run into the Keys, and confiscated two tons more hidden in food shipments. That dwarfs the 3.3 tons <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was convicted of smuggling into the country from 1978 to 1980, though he is considered responsible for much more. `` You've got an awful lot of heads on the Hydra you have to cut off,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said Friday, referring to the multiheaded creature of Greek mythology. `` <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was one of them.'' In <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> on Friday, the jury that convicted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> decided the government can confiscate millions of dollars in real estate on a <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island, as well as several planes and other items owned by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. The issue of property forfeiture has to be considered separately under federal law. According to <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> earned an estimated $ 250 million in the cocaine business. But it remained uncertain how the government could take control of property in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. During the year <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody, cocaine shipments into the country actually increased, and the absence of a current U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty clouds future anti-drug efforts, said <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>. `` We'd all be pretty silly if we thought that the arrest and conviction of one man would stop drug trafficking,'' he said. `` It's very positive news, but it's just one small battle.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials emphasize their efforts to block drug imports are continuing. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Blue Lightning'' speed boat task force released its 1987 statistics Friday, showing it helped arrest 255 people and intercepted almost seven tons of cocaine, along with more than 200 tons of marijuana. The Colombia-based <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> still ships up to 80 percent of the cocaine that makes its way into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> considered <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> one of the four managers of the cartel until his arrest early last year. The others have evaded _ and sometimes defied _ <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice. The reputed top leader, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, has twice been seized by Colombian authorities, and twice succeeded in slipping from their hands. Another of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s reputed co-leaders, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, has been sighted frequently in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> but never caught. The cartel has turned to violence to intimidate <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> authorities into abandoning cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts, <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said. In 1984, Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> was assassinated by traffickers, and in January, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crusading Attorney General <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> was gunned down. The successful anti-drug candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> was briefly kidnapped during this year's campaign. And many believe the 1985 guerrilla attack that killed many Colombian supreme court justices was coordinated with the traffickers. Whether because of the violence or not, the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty has been invalidated by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s supreme court since <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s capture, and the issue is now on hold. `` The extradition treaty was the only tool the drug-trafficking kingpins ever feared,'' said <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, adding he hopes the conviction will encourage <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to renew it. The lack of a treaty and the continued cocaine trafficking does n't mean <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s prosecution was a meaningless gesture, law enforcement officials said. `` It shows this country does very well mean business when we have a drug trafficker anywhere in the world,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON>, director of a federal task force on the south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> drug trade. `` There is no way out _ if he's committed the crime, he's going to pay the price. The conviction was a boost to front-line officers combating drug traffickers on a daily basis, especially those who have become discouraged by talk of a deal to drop the drug indictment against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, officials said. `` We're delighted,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` One of the complaints peope have been lodging for many years is that you always get the small fry. This time we got one of the big guys.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, said the conviction is a psychological boost to all agencies fighting drug trafficking. `` Every war in history has seen battles which have practical consequences byeond the immediate consequence of the battlefied,'' he said. `` By that, I mean that they serve to catalyze national will to win the war, or serve as a pyschological defeat for the other side.'' In that sense, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s conviction was `` a very real, tangible victory for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said.

 A group of air travelers paid nearly $ 1,000 for a champagne flight to nowhere, but there was n't a complaint in the bunch.

 Sinhalese assassins shot and killed the general secretary of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Friday and fellow extremists killed four other people in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, police said. Police Sub-inspector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalupahana </PERSON> said two men opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles as <PERSON> Nandalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> was being driven to his office. <PERSON> Kalupahana </PERSON> said the killers and a third man escaped on a motorcyle. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> was shot in the stomach and hand and died three hours later at a hospital, according to police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They blamed the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of ultra-nationalist Sinhalese who vowed to kill anyone who supports President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s peace efforts with the Tamil minority. General secretary is the fourth-highest post in <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s political party The party chairman was assassinated in December. Military officials said other Front gunmen killed a postal officer in <LOCATION> Kotegoda </LOCATION> town in an attempt to disrupt the delivery of postal ballots for provincial elections early next month. The victim's name was not disclosed. In a similar attack at <LOCATION> Hakmana </LOCATION>, also in the south, Front gunmen tried to kill a mailman. He escaped unhurt, but his wife and two neighbors were killed. The Front opposes the elections which are to be held as part of the peace accord to halt bloodshed in this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation. The government has blamed the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in the deaths of about 260 government officials and supporters since July 29, 1987, when the Tamil peace accord was signed. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, belongs to the Sinhalese ethnic group that controls the government and makes up 75 percent of the nation's 16 million people. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the population, say they are discriminated against in jobs and education. Tamil rebels have fought a guerrilla war for nearly five years for a separate homeland on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They rejected the 1987 accord, which provides greater autonomy in Tamil-populated areas if the rebels give up their weapons. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent more than 50,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, just off south <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, to enforce the accord, but the Tamils are now fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. On May 10, the government lifted a 5-year ban on political activities by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> after announcing it signed a peace agreement with the Sinhalese radicals. The Front denied reaching any agreement and pressed its attacks against Sinhalese politicians.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new space shuttle, a reusable craft that lands on a runway, will make its maiden voyage at about the same time that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle is scheduled to return to orbit for the first time since the Challenger disaster, an industry magazine reports. Aviation Week and Space Technology released a report Friday saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> shuttle will be launched in August and `` roughly coincide'' with the return to flight of the American space shuttle. Launch of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle is now expected in late August, probably on Aug. 29, according to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> sources. The Soviet space shuttle, which closely resembles the American original in exterior design, is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit in what is expected to be a short test mission. Earlier reports said that the Soviet shuttle's initial test flight would be conducted unmanned, but officials disclosed last week that the plans call for two pilots. Aviation Week quoted Soviet Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Vladium </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON>, chief of the Soviet space program, as saying, `` When the Americans tested their shuttle, two men took off. I believe that this experience is reasonable and can be used in our country.'' The Soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquid-fueled rocket called the Energia. Unlike the American craft, the launch rockets are not a part of the orbiting craft. Instead, the Soviet shuttle includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to the atmosphere. This will give the Soviet shuttle a greater range to manuever than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, which returns from space as a glider with no engines. Challenger exploded shortly after launch from the Kennedy Space Center on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven crew members were killed. Since then, the shuttle fleet has been grounded while <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> engineers redesigned and tested flawed equipment, including the solid-fueled rocket engines that were blamed for the accident. In August, space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched from the Kennedy Space Center with a crew of five, all veteran astronauts, and land four days later at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Aviation Week said the Soviet shuttle flight is part of an `` unprecedented'' series of space missions over the next three months `` Never before has the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> attempted so many major new space missions withing the same period,'' the magazine said. Among the Soviet flights are: _ Two robot craft to be launched to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and to the Martian moon Phobos The craft will lift off on July 7 and July 12 for the most complex planetary missions yet attempted by the Soviets. The craft will include instruments provided by eight countries and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not participating. _ On June 7, a Soyuz spacecraft with a Soviet and a Bulgarian cosmonaut will be launched to the space station Mir for an eight-day mission In August, a second Soyuz will be launched with a Soviet and an Afghan on board. _ Last Sunday, the Soviets launched a military intelligence craft the size of a school bus in a 530-mile circular orbit Two cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir completed their 150th day in orbit last Monday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has now exceeded 128,000 man-hours in space, more than triple the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total of 42,463 hours.

 Two days before he was found dead, businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> taped a message to his wife said he was buried alive `` inside some ... box'' and would die unless a $ 1 million ranson was paid. Tapes made by Small were played by the prosecutors Friday in the trial of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 31, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, who is charged with kidnapping and murdering Small, a member of a prominent media family. Small's widow, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, was the final prosecution witness in the 5-day-old trial. She told jurors that her husband's comments were on a recording played to her during a telephone call made early last Sept. 2, shortly after he was lured from their home and kidnapped. `` I'm inside some, I guess, a box,'' Small says on the tape. `` It's under a couple of feet of sand or something, like underground ... and I want you to get $ 1 million.'' The kidnapper spoke first, warning her not to call the police but to raise the money quickly or `` he would never tell me where my husband was buried,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON> said her husband assured her it was not a joke, and that the kidnapper wanted the ransom in 50 - and 100-dollar bills `` He said he hd enough air for 48 hours,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON> said, recalling her husband's final words in that 3:30 a.m. telephone call. Police unearthed Small's body two days later, buried in rural <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in a homemade wooden box in which he suffocated. More than 100 people, including members of the Small family, packed the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courtroom to hear Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON>'s testimony and to listen to the recordings. The defense was expected to begin its case Saturday. The first tape of Small and his kidnapper was found along a road, and was reconstructed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. It was difficult to understand at times, but the jury was given a transcript. Another call at about 11:30 p.m. Sept. 2 includes a recording of Small reading instructions to his wife for delivery of the cash. The money was raised and the family was prepared to pay the ransom, said Mrs. Small, but the quality of the recording was so poor she could not understand all the instructions for delivery. `` I could hear another voice in the background swearing,'' Mrs. Small testified. `` Then I realized it was <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s voice. He was giving me instructions ... where to take the money.'' Small told his wife that after the cash was delivered and counted, a map would be mailed to her giving directions to the burial site. Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON> said the kidnapper's voice came on the telephone and she tried to get clarification of the delivery orders, but soon `` he just hung up the phone.'' Small was lured by a telephone call from the family's Victorian home near the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> shortly after midnight Sept. 2, 1987. Previous testimony has linked <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> to the coffin-sized box, which witnesses said they saw him building, and to a public telephone at about the time a ransom call was being recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The woman with whom <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> lived, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, also was charged with murder and kidnapping and was awaiting trial.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to ratify a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> treaty against torture and `` demonstrate unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent practice.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, however, that if the treaty is ratified he will declare that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the competence of an international committee it sets up to investigate charges of systematic torture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I believe that a final <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decision as to whether to accept such competence of the committee should be withheld until we have had an opportunity to assess the committee's work,'' the president said. The treaty was unanimously adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and was signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month. `` It marks a significant step in the development during this century of international measures against torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Ratification of the convention by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will clearly express <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposition to torture, an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today.''

 Government regulators closed the doors Friday of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, named a receiver to take over its troubled finances and vowed that it would soon reopen under new management. Officials moved swiftly to reassure borrowers that the move was made to strengthen the billion-dollar Farm Credit System institution and that it would continue to meet needs of farmers as well as obligations to those who hold the bank's securities. `` We have taken this prudent action in order to enable the Farm Credit System to continue to provide a full range of credit services to the borrowers in the three-state area,'' said a statement from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates the Farm Credit System, placed the bank in receivership. The bank and its 90 branches in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> were closed simultaneously at 5:30 p.m. EDT. <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said the bank, under the management of the receiver, would be open during normal operating hours `` as soon as is practicable.'' `` The Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended provides mechanisms to assure that there will be no disruption of payment of principle and interest on the banks' outstanding securities,'' <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said. The Farm Credit System is a nationwide network of borrower-owned banks and lending institutions that has been a prime source of credit for American agriculture for decades. Its heavily spotlighted financial problems led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to approve a major bailout bill. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank earlier had received $ 30 million in assistance under bailout legislation to raise funds. But it had been losing $ 4.7 million a month since the first of the year. Its loan portfolio at year's end totaled $ 1.68 billion. As of March 31, 40 percent of that amount represented loans classified as not performing or at least at high risk. It reported liabilities of $ 1.909 billion. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> REW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, was named receiver. His company issued a letter to customers saying that `` every available effort will be made to continue serving ... all borrowers.'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kika </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, issued a statement calling it `` unfortunate that the situation in regard to the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has come to this stage.'' `` But I have been assured by <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> personnel that the liquidation procedure will be similar to the procedure that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> uses when closing a commercial bank,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` In fact, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> personnel are assisting with the liquidation arrangements today.'' `` Borrower stock and rights will be protected and operations will begin almost immediately under a new bank structure,'' he said. He added that he had been `` assured that other banks will assist in providing necessary credit so that there will be no interruption in providing for the needs of farmers.'' The assistance board set up under last year's bailout legislation recommended placing the bank in receivership, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> statement. `` Borrower stock is protected by the recently passed Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiver with funds provided under that act,'' <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said.

 A resolution presented to African foreign ministers on Friday calls on all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential candidates to pledge to introduce comprehensive mandatory sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if elected. The ministers began a 5-day meeting Thursday to prepare resolutions and an agenda for a summit meeting next week of the Organization of African Unity. The ministers met in private, but sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the resolution was proposed by <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamuyurira </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>, celebrating its 25th anniversary, has long tried to persuade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to take the lead in mandatory sanctions against white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to try to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid. Its usual tack has been to condemn the Western governments in end-of-summit resolutions. This year, the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> seems to be considering new strategies. Several states are pushing for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to dramatize what they say is the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government's undermining of neighboring black states. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Makatini </PERSON>, `` foreign secretary'' of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest guerrilla group fighting the South African government, said in an interview that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> wants African leaders to mount a new type of diplomatic offensive. `` For example, we have hardly been making use of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lobbying system,'' he said. `` We want to establish contact and solicit support of legislators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the sactions bill before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Makatini </PERSON> said the same strategy should be adopted for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We're going to go for individuals,'' he said. `` For 25 years, we have been relying on government or parties in power.

<TEXT>
 A court ruled Friday that women in the black homeland of <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION> must be allowed to vote and nullified all-male elections held in 1984. Justice C.F. <PERSON> Eloff </PERSON> declared invalid a proclamation signed by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that denied women the right to vote or sit in the homeland's legislative assembly. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and members of the legislature who opposed the court action by five <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION> women were ordered to pay costs. About 50 women wearing traditional colorful blankets attended Friday's session at <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> KwaNdebele </ORGANIZATION> is the only of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 10 black homelands where women have not been allowed to vote. The judge also said the 1984 elections for 16 legislative seats were null and void. One of the 16 seats was captured by <PERSON> Majozi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlangu </PERSON>, who later was elected chief minister of the homeland by the assembly. Of the 77 seats in the assembly, 61 are appointed. It was not immediately clear how or when the empty seats will be filled and whether <PERSON> Mahlangu </PERSON> will be allowed to remain chief minister. <ORGANIZATION> KwaNdebele </ORGANIZATION> is an impoverished area the size of <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> with almost no resources or infrastructure. About 400,000 people live in the territory northeast of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, and many workers spend up to eight hours a day commuting to jobs in white areas. The homeland currently has `` self-governing'' status but is considering opting for independence, as four homelands already have done. <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION> authorities have been accused of harsh treatment toward dissidents who oppose independence. Nic de Villiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the police play an `` overtly political role'' in the homeland and often mistreat activists. `` Not only does the tone of the police leadership permit assaults, it positively encourages them,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> said at a recent conference organized by Lawyers for Human Rights. The South African government said it created the homelands so that each major black tribe could exercise self-government on its own territory. Critics of the system say it is part of the government's effort to splinter the black majority so that white-minority rule can more easily be maintained.

 The driver of the pickup truck that slammed into a church bus last week pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder on Friday, one count for each person killed in the fiery crash. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was taken to the psychiatric unit at the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> LaGrange </LOCATION>, where doctors will determine whether he is competent to stand trial.

The bus was carrying 67 people, mostly teen-agers, on their way home from an outing at an amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The pleas were entered by <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergent </PERSON>. Meanwhile, funerals were being held Friday in three states for 15 of the 27 crash victims, including an evening service for nine youths and one adult at the church that owned the bus, <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God. In <LOCATION> Bardstown </LOCATION>, the funeral Mass for <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 12, at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> `` just got terribly emotional,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>. Family, clergymen and choir joined hands and wept in front of the altar, he said, calling it `` a moment when the whole church just let go together.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, who police said was legally drunk at the time of the crash, kept his head bowed or his eyes lowered throughout the 18-minute arraignment. He did not say anything. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> had been released from <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where he had been treated since the accident. That left 13 people injured in the crash still hospitalized Friday, five of them in critical condition.

Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Beech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was arrested at the airport in nearby <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> on Friday afternoon after arriving on a flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Police acted on a tip that she would be carrying drugs, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> vice and narcotics unit. Narcotics investigators stopped Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Bush </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> parking lot and confiscated a wet, leafy substance believed to contain PCP. She was taken to the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> County-Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where police said a search turned up a further two vials suspected to contain PCP hidden in her blouse. She was charged with possession of PCP. PCP, also known as `` angel dust,'' is a powerful psychedelic drug. On May 10, Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, after a small fire in her hotel room and later charged with possession of PCP, criminal mischief and arson. <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Audette </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is due to appear in <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. She also was arrested in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> on April 9 and charged with possessing PCP. She claimed at the time that she had been set up by a friend of her husband's. On Thursday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> posted $ 24,218 bond and was released from <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail on condition that he not leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Magistrate <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> said. He was arrested near his home Wednesday after his wife called police and said he was abusing her. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was charged with possession of PCP, resisting arrest, illegal possession of a pistol, failure to stop for a police car and simple assault and battery. The arrest was his third in six months. `` It's getting to the point where we're spending a lot of time investigating Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s domestic problems,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehurst </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Aiken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday his wife planted the drugs on him and that he was working `` to keep the city and the world clean'' of drugs. `` I do n't have a drug problem,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, said he expects to ask that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> be allowed to go on the tour. `` That's how -LRB- Brown -RRB- earns his livelihood,'' Weeks said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was allowed to tour in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in April after posting bond on charges of assault with intent to kill his wife and with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has filed for divorce, and her husband said he plans to do the same.

<HEAD>Blacks Could Swing Presidential Election to Democrats, Hooks Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Blacks could provide the crucial votes that swing this fall's presidential election to the Democrats even though <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not likely to be the party's nominee, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday Hooks talked about the presidential campaign at a news conference before making a commencement address at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> forecast that the black vote `` will be predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION>,'' but he said he hoped that `` both parties will look at this black vote, which can constitute 10 to 12 percent of the general electorate vote, as a vote that ought to be pursued diligently.'' He said blacks should make efforts not to appear to be the captives of one party. `` If that becomes the fact, then we will be ignored by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and overlooked by the other party and we become of no consequence,'' he said. Hooks said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appears to have locked up the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have a hard time deciding whether to accept the vice presidential nomination, if it is offered, he added. `` The only thing you could give -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- that would be bigger than what he has would be the presidency and it appears at this point he wo n't get it,'' Hooks said. `` He's a young man and I think he'll be running for president for the next 20 years and maybe one of these years he'll make it.'' In his address, Hooks urged 2,015 graduates to vote and noted that fewer than 60 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 1984 presidential election. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> urged graduates of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> to combat the use of illegal drugs and said exporting health care will help friendly democracies take hold overseas. `` Only healthy people have the strength really needed to win freedom and maintain it against all manner of tyranny,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told a commencement audience of about 4,000, including 554 graduates. Some graduates circulated a statement during the ceremonies protesting <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s selection as speaker and the university's proposed involvement in research and health at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, the nation's only plant making weapons-grade plutonium In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Friday for her contributions to the international Special Olympics.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee fired because he has AIDS-related complex is being reinstated in his old job on a part-time basis, the department said Friday. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a clerk-typist in the department's community relations service, will return to work Monday and work 4 -LCB- hours a day five days a week, department spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was dismissed April 11 because he was absent for 30 days during the nine months he worked for the service. He said a supervisor suggested he take 10 days leave without pay after he was diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex, a less severe form of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said he took 14 days' leave without pay to participate in an experimental treatment program at the National Institutes of Health. After his dismissal was publicized this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered to rehire him in a temporary one-year post. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> rejected that offer this week, saying he wanted to be reinstated in his old job because it was a permanent position carrying more protections and benefits. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the department reached the latest decision to reinstate him after considering new conditions relating to his health, including a stabilization of his physical condition. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the department also wanted to conclude the matter in a fair and humane manner. <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION> is a contagious condition that indicates a victim has been exposed to the AIDS virus.

<HEAD>Men Who Tracked Pearl Harbor Attack Gather For Reunion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the Japanese planes headed toward <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1941, Pfc. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhard </PERSON> tracked mysterious blips on his radar screen on the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>. `` We picked up a huge indication on the scope of something. We had no idea what it was,'' he said Friday. `` We did n't know if it was a bird, Superman or a plane.'' He and another young serviceman were alone in the radar room, watching the pulsing signal move steadily toward the island. <PERSON> Lockhard </PERSON> relayed the information by telephone to a lieutenant, who brushed aside the concerns of the 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> radarman, noting that it was probably a squadron of B-17s en route from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We continued to plot it and track it and called back again. I was more insistent. But nothing was done,'' he said. `` We plotted it to within 20 miles of the island, and at that point, the signal became lost in the terrain.'' Moments later, `` We had been attacked. You could see the smoke rising. We immediately knew what we had seen.'' About 3,700 American servicemen and civilians were killed in the attack. Friday, <PERSON> Lockhard </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, met in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for the first time in 47 years, and a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in this suburb, where a model of the SCR-270 radar is on display. The device was built by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The SCR-270, which tracked the approach of the planes, was `` the Model T of radar,'' said <PERSON> Lockhard </PERSON>, a retired project manager at <ORGANIZATION> AMP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a maker of electrical connections. `` Many people had faith in it, but there were also a lot of doubting <PERSON> Thomases </PERSON>. A lot of military people looked on it as a toy,'' he said. `` They did n't believe in it enough to believe it was the valuable tool that it was.'' Six radar units had been delivered to the island about three months earlier, he said. `` It was a brand new animal,'' <PERSON> Lockhard </PERSON> said. `` We had no idea it was an enemy attack, other than we thought something was wrong with the equipment. I ran it through a series of checks. `` The feeling was more like incredulity. It was phenomenal. It's one of the footnotes to history You can play out all sorts of ` what if' games. `` The real value to the whole thing, I've always felt, was it gave credibility to the equipment. Everybody recognized the potential, where some did n't before.''

<HEAD>Japan Must Offer New Ideas On Beef, Citrus Imports, U.S. Aide Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> served notice Friday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is willing to pursue talks on opening the Japanese market for imported beef and citrus, but that it is up to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to offer new proposals. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to attend the three-day <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which ended Friday. He met for unofficial talks with officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Forestry and Fisheries Thursday. On Friday, he told a news conference at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is prepared to listen, but we feel the Japanese must show more flexibility in their position. ... It is not up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make more proposals, but up to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' `` We're over here and they're over there,'' he said, adding that as a negotiator he saw no reason for optimism yet. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s semi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which controls imports of beef, `` interferes in the market'' and `` should stay out of our business.'' The corporation charges a 50 percent tax on imported beef before it is sold to wholesalers. He reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position against surcharges on beef imports, saying such surcharges hurt foreign exporters and violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum for international trade disputes. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that unlike tariffs, surcharges are unilateral measures which involve no `` swapping'' with trading partners and `` upset the balance set in tariff negotiations.'' He said surcharges fluctuate to stabilize prices and add an element of uncertainty to exporters, while tariffs are fixed and transparent. In response to a reporter's question, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also said an increase in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s tariffs `` would seem exceedingly strange'' since tariffs are a transitional measure to cushion producers during structural changes. Instead, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> suggested that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> establish a domestic income maintenance system that would not burden foreign exporters. Though both sides have expressed a desire to settle the dispute between themselves, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has brought the issue before <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> and will keep pursuing <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> action `` until and unless there is a bilateral decision,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. An earlier U.S.-Japanese agreement setting quotas on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expired in March. Talks to set a new timetable for market liberalization broke down, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> took its case to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> on May 4. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, another major exporter of beef to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has also filed a complaint with the international body.

 Senators gave the public a peek at their personal finances Friday, disclosing a generally well-to-do group that loves to talk for money, collects interesting gifts and leans toward conservative investments. Release of the financial disclosure forms, required annually, showed there are far more millionaires in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than are found in most other 100-member groups. Some, although not many, of the senators are not doing nearly so well, including <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., the former presidential candidate, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s assets, not including the family home, total only $ 21,000 and his liabilities are at least $ But he earned more than $ 110,000 last year, including his $ 87,483 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salary. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> reported assets of $ 21,000 to $ 45,000 and liabilities of $ 20,000 to $ 30,000. Although it is possible that as many as three-dozen senators are millionaires, it is difficult to determine real financial worth from reading the disclosure reports. Senators are required to report income, assets and liabilities only within a broad range; for example, a $ 10 million investment need be reported only as exceeding $ 250,000. On that basis, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> IV, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> heir who could be the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s richest member, is shown as having assets of at least $ 882,000 and income of at least $ Another millionaire, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., put no dollar value on the trusts that make up the bulk of his wealth although he reported income of at least $ 596,747 <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has the type of trusts whose worth are not subject to the disclosure law.

He reported $ 106,050, mostly for speechmaking, and gave $ 80,000 of it to charity. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, picked up $ 47,350 in honoraria, giving $ 12,500 to charity. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., reported $ 37,350 in honoraria; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., $ 59,175, almost $ 30,000 of which was given to charity; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, $ 60,450, including $ 23,450 given to charity; and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., $ 50,500, of which $ 16,007 went Senators are allowed to earn as much as they like by speechmaking, but they can not keep for their own use honoraria exceeding 40 percent of their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salary. The salary reached its current annual level of $ 89,500 in March, meaning that members earned slightly less than that in 1987. Several senators picked up pocket change last year by writing for newspapers and magazines. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' standard fee appeared to be $ 100; the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 150 or $ 200; <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 150; the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 33.33. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, pocketed $ 300 for an article in Conservative Digest.

<HEAD>Communist Official Rejects Cardinal's Letter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior government official on Friday dismissed a critical letter from a Roman Catholic leader as too confrontational, an official report said. Deputy Premier <PERSON> Matej </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> rejected the cardinal's letter at a meeting of church dignitaries and cultural officials. He said the letter `` adopts and authorizes opinions of those who actually try to misuse the interests of believers and churches for political purposes leading to pressure.'' In the letter, dated April 23, Czechoslovak Catholic primate <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> demanded a new state policy toward religion. He signaled Catholics were ready to fight for religious freedom. Relations between the Communist authorities and the church have been strained over the government's refusal to allow any bishops to be appointed in the last 15 years. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has refused to accept candidates from the state-sponsored clergy association Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION>. Half a million Catholics signed a petition organized by a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lay activist in December to demand more bishops, more priests and an end to harassment for churchgoers. The cardinal, in the letter sent to Premier <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, said that force used by police to break up a peaceful demonstration in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> in March illustrated the need for a new policy of dialogue. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> said contacts between the state and church had reached a state of crisis. He said that <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> who `` are conscious of their rights will demand them and are prepared to make sacrifices.'' <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON>, however, responded that `` due to its confrontation platform and tactless procedure, the letter can not create a basis for constructive relations, and the government is therefore forced to reject it.'' <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> also complained that the letter was made available to the Western media `` as background material for new attacks.'' Authorities and the church recently reached agreement on the appointment of two bishops to assist <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> and an apostolic administrator for the Slovak diocese of <LOCATION> Trnava </LOCATION>. Still, 10 of the country's 13 bishops' posts remain vacant, a situation the cardinal described as `` catastrophic.'' The three bishops are all over 75.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conviction of Colombian drug trafficker <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> received scant attention in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s press Friday with most papers concentrating on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 3-1 soccer victory over <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. None of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 20 daily newspapers ran editorial comment on the case and several did not mention the case at all. No public demonstrations for or against the conviction were reported. Indeed, the legal aspects of the case drew the most attention. Former Justice Minister <PERSON> Felio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON> said Friday that a U.S.-Colombia treaty limits to 30 years the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sentence that may be imposed on convicted drug traffickers extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, echoing a point that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s lawyer tried to make in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s seven-month trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, ended Thursday when he was convicted of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine and of related charges. He faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines when he is sentenced July 20. In an interview with the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON> said, `` The Colombian government should make a case in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts to the effect that a Colombian citizen can not be sentenced ... to a term not encompassed by Colombian law.'' The maximum sentence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is 30 years in prison. Another former justice minister, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizosa </PERSON>, criticized the trial for using evidence from criminals trying to get lighter sentences. However, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON>, said soon after the conviction that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was known to be involved in the drug trade. Colombian authorities captured <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> on Feb. 4, 1987, and he was extradited the same day. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is the biggest Colombian drug trafficker ever convicted in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court. He was identified as belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Colombians who control cocaine smuggling into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A 1979 treaty says no Colombian extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can be sentenced to more than the maximum penalty _ 30 years in this case _ that the defendant would have faced in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was extradited last year, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled the extradition treaty unconstitutional on a technicality. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was the last of 15 people sent by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> insists that the treaty is valid. Former Minister <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizosa </PERSON> suggested in a broadcast interview Friday with <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> did not get a fair trial because much of the evidence against him came from criminals on the lookout for reduced sentences for themselves. <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> told reporters during an impromptu news conference Thursday that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s conviction did not surprise him since `` <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s link to drug trafficking was common knowledge.'' While in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> bragged publicly about being involved in drug trafficking. Earlier this year in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, thousands of people rioted to protest the extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, accused of being a major drug smuggler.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for nine months starting this August and for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to drop drug smuggling indictments against him, an administration official said Friday. The arrangement would give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a role in setting up a transition government before leaving, said the official, who has followed the negotiations but insisted on anonymity. The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments, allows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays and to go back permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement. He said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed reservations. However, one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s criminal attorneys in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said Friday night that no agreement has been reached. `` I've just talked to a high-ranking member of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s staff in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and he denies that any deal has been struck,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, deputy White House press secretary, also denied that a tentative agreement had been reached. `` The talks have not broken down, nor has there been any agreement,'' he said. `` The process still continues.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Friday made no reference to the reports of a deal when he addressed thousands of supporters in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> district outside the capital of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In response to questions from local officials about talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said any discussions must be based on `` respect for the president of the republic, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>.'' `` There can not be conversation, there can not be a solution if an exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as psychological aggression,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` Neither can there be any solution as long as the popular forces and a militantly recognized government are not part of it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said Friday that the vice president opposes negotiating with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over the conditions under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might surrender power. `` The administration sources who have suggested that the vice president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are essentially correct,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday, but the vice president's aides would not say whether they discussed the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. The official who discussed the tentative deal also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recall deputy assistant secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> has spent virtually all of May in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> trying to work out an agreement. The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter said, `` If it gets accepted, it gives <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> everything he wants.'' The official said there were no assurances that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the agreement specifies. If the deal receives final approval, the official said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the transition government. Late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consultations. He said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s return does not mean any change in the process. `` The process continues,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, declining further comment. Associates of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have said in recent weeks that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense Forces. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view is that dropping the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a defensible bargaining position because he can not be extradited so long as he remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It contends that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s price for leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. According to a published report earlier this week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been calling on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5. President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25 but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions have contributed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic demise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apprehensions about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were heightened on Thursday when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employees and their families so that Panamanians will `` know the Gringos who are starving us to death.'' The supplement in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION>, a propaganda organ of the government, said the Americans `` think the walls of their embassy are impregnable.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the supplement has been `` noted with concern'' and that appropriate security measures have been taken. He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated. `` We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` This appears to be part of that. The way to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need to be taken.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> had no comment on the negotiations. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also refused comment except to say they were continuing.

 The furor over expensive yachts confiscated for as little as a single marijuana cigarette has led the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to review, but not abandon, the `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy. Civil libertarians have attacked the seizures as unconstitutional, arguing searches are often illegal and owners are being punished for something done by others. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, which explored the wreck of the Titanic, was the latest confiscated vessel to be returned to its owners. The ship was seized in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> when a crewman was found with a small amount of marijuana. `` The Atlantis II is being given back because the owners were perfectly innocent, and they're actually shocked because they were trying to improve their security,'' said <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. The crewman pleaded guilty Thursday to misdemeanor drug possession and was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation and fined $ 100, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, a Los Angeles-based Customs spokesman. Under an agreement reached Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> will resume scientific expeditions technically under Customs' control while its owner, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, petitions the seizure, he said. Privately, Customs officials have expressed anger at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s highly publicized aggressive seizures of boats. `` They are destroying the program,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymnity. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarded and confiscated the $ 2.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the Monkey Business, notorious as the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> vacation boat of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and their friends. Both yachts carried only minute amounts of drugs. Under zero tolerance, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to turn over all vessels seized for drugs to Customs. But Customs refused to take custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Monkey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> because officials felt the search was poorly done. That yacht had to be returned to its owners by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> without fines or penalties. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has now agreed to take another look at such seizures. Specific changes will be implemented `` within a couple of weeks,'' Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trainor </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division, said Thursday `` We realized that, although the owner is responsible for that boat, there had to be some reasonableness to it,'' <PERSON> Trainor </PERSON> said. `` We're not in the business of harassing boaters, and we're not in the business of seizing boats,'' he said. Among changes being considered are delaying seizures of charter vessels until after the boats return to port and drop off their passengers, employing `` technical seizures'' that allow owners to keep their vessels while they argue against forfeiture, and educating <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers on exemptions in the zero tolerance policy. But <PERSON> Trainor </PERSON> said the changes do n't mean the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is abandoning enforcement of the policy. `` We are part of the national effort to stamp out drugs in this country,'' <PERSON> Trainor </PERSON> said. `` We're holding everybody accountable for his own actions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a review of its own, said attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>. `` From reports I've heard, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers are jumping on board and not bothering to check safety _ they're going right to a search. That means people's billfolds, that means drawers, that means closets,'' she said. `` The search of every nook and cranny when there's no reasonable cause _ that violates people's constitutional rights.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up Again as Higher Inflation Looms</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf pvs bgng, `The April,' to FIX month to March,
sted May</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Big increases in food, energy and clothing costs sent consumer prices up 0.4 percent in April, an annual rate of increase of 5.3 percent, as the country got its second monthly dose of higher inflation, the government reported Friday. Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six years, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight labor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar, analysts said. The April price increase followed a 0.5 percent March advance, which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January 1987. Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is worrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety of areas. In April, grocery store prices shot up 0.8 percent, the biggest increase in 20 months, while gasoline costs, which had fallen from September though February, jumped 1.1 percent. Clothing costs, which had surged a record 2 percent in March, posted another 2 percent rise in April, reflecting higher costs of imports. `` We have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that is widespread,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is the consequence of both the strength in the economy and the effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices.'' Seven months after the October stock market crash raised fears of a recession, analysts have now switched to worrying that the economy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures are building. They cite the fact that factories are now operating at the highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a 14-year-low of 5.4 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> already has boosted interest rates twice in the past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head off further inflationary pressures. But the tightening has done little to reassure financial markets, which have been in a tailspin in recent days, driven down not only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates will go higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.13 to close at 1,952.59, bringing the loss for the week to 37.95 points as concerns about inflation and higher interest rates continued to dominate the market. Top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, have contended the market's inflationary fears are overblown In a statement Friday, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` inflation remains under control'' with no significant acceleration from recent years. But private economists disagreed. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, predicted consumer prices would rise by 5.5 percent this year. That would be the fastest inflation rate since 1981 and up substantially from the 4.4 percent increase in 1987. `` The fears that people have had about higher inflation are justified,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` The general message in this report is that prices have been rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will continue to do so.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to keep pushing interest rates higher to fight rising inflationary pressures and that this eventually will lead to a recession sometime next year. But other economists said it was too soon to predict a recession from the upturn in inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave these details of its Consumer Price Index for April: _ More than one-fourth of the monthly increase came from the 2 percent rise in clothing costs, paced by a 3.5 percent jump in women's apparel, a 2.7 percent rise in the prices for children's goods and a 2.1 percent increase in men's _ The 0.8 percent rise in grocery store prices, the biggest since August 1986, reflected higher prices for beef -LRB- up 2.3 percent -RRB-, fish -LRB- up 2.9 percent -RRB- and fruits and vegetables -LRB- up 1.4 percent -RRB- The higher food costs contributed another one-fourth of the overall price increase in April. _ In addition to the 1.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, home heating oil rose 0.9 percent and natural gas and electricity costs were up 0.4 percent Some analysts predicted further gasoline price increases in May, but they said prices should moderate after that because of the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to reach agreement with non-member nations to limit production. _ New car prices were unchanged in April, but the cost of public transportation jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting higher airline ticket prices The various increases left the consumer price index at 117.1, meaning a market basket of consumer goods costing $ 10.00 on average between 1982 and 1984, cost $ 11.71 last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in another report Friday that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.9 percent in April as the 0.4 percent rise in inflation was offset by increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked. The changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 0.3 percent above a year ago. In other economic news Friday: _ Income tax collections helped shrink the federal budget deficit by $ 13.9 billion in April, but the deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal year, $ 105.0 billion, was running 24.6 percent ahead of last year Economists said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would have difficulty meeting its deficit projection for 1988 of $ 146.7 billion. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced that effective Monday it was increasing the maximum interest rate on federally-backed VA home mortgages by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 percent _ Average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages increased to 10.52 percent this week, up from 10.40 percent last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said

 A woman opened fire in an elementary school, killing one child and critically wounding five others Friday. She was found dead when a SWAT team stormed a house where she had wounded a seventh person. `` I've just received information that the suspect has been found and she is dead,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said about 7:30 CDT. `` The situation is over. I do n't have any information about how she died. She has been found in the home, and she is dead. There have been no other injuries,'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. The woman, identified as <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, was carrying at least two handguns when she opened fire in a classroom of the one-story, red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, killing a child and wounding five others. A hostage negotiating team arrived at the house moments after the woman took it over around 11:30 a.m, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> spoke by telephone to her parents, who were brought to the house in hopes of talking her out. Asked why police had not attempted to storm the house earlier, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> replied, `` We've had seven people shot already. We're not going in there without taking every precaution.'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said he decided to send the SWAT team into the house after repeated efforts by police and Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s parents failed to contact her. He said the SWAT team was accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents using sound-detecting devices to try to detect any movement in the house. <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said police had yet to establish a motive for the rampage. `` There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked over'' as the children panicked during the 15 minutes the shooting lasted, said <LOCATION> Glencoe </LOCATION> Patrolman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceglieski </PERSON>. `` Kids were lying around in very serious condition,'' in the one-story, red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. `` Kids were hiding under the desk as well as well as they could.'' Police believe she had set fire earlier in the day to another home eight blocks away where she worked as a housekeeper in this affluent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geier </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` an investigative interest'' in Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> said she had been arrested there March 14 on a charge of retail theft. He gave no further details. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that he had roomed across the hall from Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> when they attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>. He described her as `` just an absolutely bizarre lady'' and said `` sometimes she'd wander the halls and try to open doors. <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>, the police chief, said when the woman walked into the school around 10:45 a.m., her first stop was a boys' bathroom, where she shot a youngster. `` She left him and ran into one classroom, telling the teacher there that a boy had been wounded,'' said <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>. `` Then she entered a second classroom, announced she had a gun and opened fire.'' Police recovered a .32 - caliber handgun from the school bathroom and the woman was believed to also have carried a .22 - caliber gun and a third, unidentified weapon, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said the woman then ran through the woods from the school and entered the home, where four members of a family and their maid were present. `` Apparently, she just walked in and confronted the homeowners,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. `` The mother came running out and said, ` There's a woman in my home with a gun.' `` Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and fell over in the driveway,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. The son apparently struggled with the suspect, grabbed one of her weapons, and was shot in the chest, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. The father, maid and grandfather fled by side door, leaving the suspect alone inside, <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. He said he believed the woman had three weapons and police had recovered two of them. <PERSON> Geier </PERSON> said the suspect was believed to have set fire to the home where she worked while a mother and her children were in the basement doing laundry. `` This woman set a fire in the house, trapping the people in the basement,'' he said. `` They escaped, got out, apparently without serious injury.'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> also said Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> apparently had planted a number of incendiary devices in North Shore communities. He said some devices were found in her car in the neighborhood near the house, but he refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> refused to say exactly what the devices were and did not say whether they were planted or found Friday. The fire at the house where she worked was caused by one of the devices, he said. Eight-year-old <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> died of his wounds at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Newtwon </PERSON>. Another 8-year-old boy and the 22-year-old man shot at his home were in critical condition at the hospital, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaracchia </PERSON>. The four children at <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were reported in critical but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>. They were identified as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebourek </PERSON>, 8, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trossman </PERSON>, 6, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 7, said another spokeswoman, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Soohoo </PERSON>. At the school, meanwhile, parents clustered in groups, consoling each other. Village Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON> said children were released in small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their safety.

 A western cold front spawned thunderstorms, high winds and hail over most of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Friday, while the rain-saturated East Coast got still more precipitation. Severe thunderstorms blanketed the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, with clusters of showers over central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, as well as eastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> to southwest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Residents in <LOCATION> Hobbs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, reported seeing two tornadoes touch down Friday. One twister tore part of the roof and a side from a building, uprooted trees, knocked down telephone poles and overturned a pickup truck, slightly injuring the driver. The second tornado destroyed an unoccupied mobile home, and tore off parts of the roofs of two houses, a witness said. The storm system brought golf ball-sized hail at Hunt and <LOCATION> Kerrville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and marble-sized hail near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. Showers over the central High Plains and southern and central Rockies were accompanied by blustery north winds gusting to 40 mph, sending the mercury plunging into the 40s and 50s Rain and drizzly weather continued in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, with severe storms stretching from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> during the afternoon and evening. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where 8 inches of rain have fallen in parts of the state since Monday, a 16-year-old youth drowned Thursday night while rafting with some friends on a rain-swollen creek in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, state police said. The heavy rains have caused creeks and streams to overflow, as well as minor flooding in low-lying areas. Southwestern and eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, parts of eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, northern and western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, northern and central <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the eastern Panhandle of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had all issued flood watches through the evening.

<HEAD>Banks Are Asked to Waive Debtor Countries' Interest Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> suggested Friday that commercial banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries voluntarily give up $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion of interest owed them by 17 heavily indebted countries. In a special report, the bank, which is owned by 151 governments, said interest waivers of about two percentage points on the debt owed by the so-called `` middle income countries'' would generate the same financial relief in the first year as a $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion loan. The `` middle income countries'' in question are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. They have foreign debts of about $ 500 billion. The 42-page report, `` The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the Heavily Indebted Middle-Income Countries,'' did not say how long the waivers should be continued. The same suggestion was made privately last month by <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, the bank's president, to representatives of member countries. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> and government financial leaders including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, have criticized commercial banks for not lending more. The commercial banks, meanwhile, say governments and intergovernmental bodies like the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and its sister body, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, should do more lending. The report said governments of borrowing countries are reluctant to borrow more without some relief. They complain they are already paying out $ 30 billion a year to more prosperous countries, mostly on old debt. `` In many of these countries, per capita income and consumption have fallen considerably over the past five years and are for some countries back to levels that were already attained in the early 1960s,'' according to the report. The average Argentine earned $ 2,350 in 1986, compared with $ 160 for the average Nepalese, $ 17,840 for the average Swiss and $ 17,500 for the average American, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s figures. The report cites <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where 700,000 teen-agers reach working age every year and few jobs have been created since 1981. Unemployment in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> increased by 70 percent between 1981 and 1984, it says. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the largest source of aid money to nearly 120 countries, lending about $ 17 billion annually. That figure is expected to increase to more than $ 20 billion in the 1990s.

 A 2-week-old <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet made an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> last week after a leak spewed fuel into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. No injuries were reported when the twin-engine jet, a wide-body <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A300-600R, landed with one engine operating after losing fuel through a crack in the right engine, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. The flight was en route to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with 90 passengers aboard on May 10, when a fuel pump split in the right engine, he said. The pilot tried to stop fuel flowing to the damaged pump, but the shut-off valve was beyond the crack. He then released fire-extinguisher bottles in the engine to shut it down and diverted to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. He said the jet did not run out of fuel and added that authorities have not determined the cause of the split. After the incident, repairmen from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> _ which manufactures the plane's engines _ flew people to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> to fix the pump, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Venz </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Herndon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The plane was then flown back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and put back into service the next day, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Venz </PERSON> said the 267-person-capacity jet, designed so it can operate on just one engine if necessary, was delivered to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> two weeks prior to the incident.

<HEAD>Police Can Now Wiretap Telephones of Suspected Drug Dealers Under

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> signed a law Friday permitting state law enforcement officers to wiretap suspected big time drug dealers, but officials said the bill wo n't add much punch to the war against drug-dealing street gangs. The law is a long-sought, if partial, victory for police and conservatives, who spent decades seeking far broader powers to conduct electronic surveillance. Outrage over drug-related gang violence overrode concerns about privacy and helped win passage of the bill, but some officials said the powers are too weak to be of much use against gangs. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said most gangs do n't deal in large enough quantities of drugs to trigger wiretapping. `` If you're able to use it extensively for gangs, it would give law enforcement an insight into the structure of gangs,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` They are very smart; much smarter than our legislators, unfortunately.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> also criticized the bill because it only applies to drug crimes. `` It should be used for murders, kidnappings and terrorists. -LRB- But -RRB- we're only using it for narcotics,'' he said, adding that federal investigators can use wiretaps to investigate a greater array of crimes. Beginning Jan. 1, state and local law enforcement agencies may tap telephones in drug cases involving at least 10 gallons or three pounds of heroin, cocaine, PCP or methamphetamine. Police must obtain permission to tap from a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. Officers conducting taps would have to go through special training, could not enter a private residence covertly to install a listening device and would have to report to the judge every 72 hours on the progress of the tap. Unauthorized use of information obtained through a wiretap could result in a fine of up to $ 10,000 or imprisonment. `` The bill is not as strong as we'd like it to be. However, it is going to be an effective tool,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said in signing the law at the Hall of Justice. `` This is not a panacea that will end all the drug abuse in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but it's a small tool we can use,'' said <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Trask </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney and president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Under the federal wiretapping law adopted in 1968, federal investigators can use electronic surveillance in certain murder cases, such as political assassinations and murders-for-hire, drug cases, and other suspected crimes such as bribery, racketeering, treason and sexual exploitation of children, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sander </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. There are no quantity limitations on the drug cases that can be investigated, he added. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved wiretap legislation several times since 1970, but all previous attempts died in the Assembly. Many legislators and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have opposed wiretapping as an invasion of privacy. But aided by the rising concern over gang activities, a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats this year pushed the proposal around a committee that has blocked previous efforts in the lower house. The bill was approved by votes of 31-3 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 49-19 in the Assembly. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> officials did not return phone calls Friday.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. The statement by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> is considered the most liberal of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two autonomous provinces. The ministry statement said the federal military council met on March 25 and concluded that `` dissident tendencies'' in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government But it said there was no discussion at the meeting `` about a plan for action against special warfare in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>.'' The term special warfare refers to subversive actions. The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy. It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>'s military command. The police said `` they had no available data which would justify such evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement. It reported the police also said there were no `` subversive forces behind'' articles carried in the Slovenian news media. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidium also `` expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions,'' said the statement. Some army commanders have been increasingly critical of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s leadership, saying it should act firmly against political dissidents. And Slovenian Communists have frequently criticized the way the federal government is dealing with the country's economic and social problems. <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, the official publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> organization, wrote of possible military intervention in its current issue. It published a letter to <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of `` nonconformist journalists, writers and officials.'' The letter said military units would be used to crush demonstrations that were expected to be called to protest the arrests. It also said the army did not notify <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s civilian leadership of the planned intervention. The plan was blocked by <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s member in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s collective presidency, after they were told about it by Slovenian security organizations, the letter said <PERSON> Svetozar </PERSON> <PERSON> Visnjic </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>'s military command, dismissed the reports of planned military action as `` nonsense and a fabrication.'' He made the comment in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> newspaper.

 A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plans to start random drug testing of all 13,000 federal prison workers, saying the testing of `` law-abiding employees'' posed constitutional problems. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order sought by a labor union against the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, one of the first federal agencies scheduled to begin drug testing under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s September 1986 executive order. `` The program would force law-abiding employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> to submit to testing even though not suspected of any wrongdoing, negligence or dereliction of duty,'' <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> said in his order. The 750,000-member American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, also has challenged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s entire drug testing program, covering 345,000 employees in 40 agencies, in a separate lawsuit. The union chose the federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for both suits because of favorable precedents from the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled against post-accident testing of railroad workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> may resolve the issue in a case scheduled for argument this fall involving the testing of applicants for jobs and promotions in the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON>'s order blocks testing of prison workers, which had been set to start Monday, until at least next Thursday, when a hearing is scheduled on a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. The injunction, if granted, could be appealed to higher courts. <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> pressed a government lawyer, apparently without success, to bypass the preliminary injunction hearing and allow the ban to stay in effect until a full-scale trial of the lawsuit June 16. `` I do n't think the world's going to come to an end because the program is delayed until a full, careful consideration,'' the judge said. But <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON> said the government was unwilling to let the temporary ban, which can not be appealed, stay in effect longer than the 20-day legal limit for restraining orders. At a hearing Thursday, <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> had concluded that even a few days' delay in testing `` would cause a great chance of serious injury, even death.'' Both <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> and a union lawyer questioned that claim. Under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1986 order, federal agencies are to conduct random urinalysis testing of employees in `` sensitive'' jobs, and also test applicants for new jobs and promotions, workers involved in accidents, and supervisors. Workers who fail the tests can be fired if they decline rehabilitation and lesser discipline. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> has declared that all its employees hold `` sensitive'' jobs and therefore are subject to random testing, with 5 to 10 percent of the staff tested each year. The <ORGANIZATION> AFGE </ORGANIZATION> suit contends the program violates constitutional standards for unreasonable searches by allowing testing without individual suspicion of drug use. The suit also claims violations of federal laws forbidding discrimination against the handicapped and requiring employee discipline to be related to job performance. In his order, <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and appellate rulings `` cast serious doubt upon the constitutionality and lawfulness'' of the program. The judge said his order does not prohibit testing of any prison employee based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that impairs job performance. That is the standard the government has been following since 1985, <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Friday that talks between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not be held `` if the aggression continues.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told thousands of supporters in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> district outside the capital that: `` There can not be conversation if aggression continues, aggression at whatever level, whatever magnitude, whether it be psychological or economic aggression.'' He made no reference to reports in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal calling for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in August and stay away until May 1989 when presidential elections will be held. A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters that in return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to drop federal drug smuggling charges against him and give him a role in setting up a transitional government. The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments, allows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays and to go back permanently after the presidential elections, the official said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, in response to questions from local officials about talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said any discussions must be based on `` respect for the president of the republic, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>.'' `` There can not be conversation, there can not be a solution if an exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as psychological aggression,'' he said. `` Neither can there be any solution as long as the popular forces and a militantly recognized government are not part of it,'' he said at the inauguration of a grandstand at a sports complex in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as head of the 15,000-member Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the power behind the civilian government. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed sweeping economic sanctions against the country in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who has been in hiding, as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> dismissed him Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. There are about 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed at 10 installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a democratic country but it is a democracy, `` without the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> label, democracy with the Panamanian tricolor, with the taste of Panamanian soup and with the tone and the tune of the little drum.'' Arrayed on the field before <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were hundreds of members of so-called Dignity Battalions. The volunteer battalions have been formed to confront what the Noriega-controlled government says is the danger of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. About 30 volunteers, clad in T-shirts and blue jeans and carrying World War II-era rifles, ran through an obstacle course, then jabbed or battered a dummy dressed in olive green as a demonstration of their training. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> will be the tomb of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> imperialism,'' said an announcer through loudspeakers as the volunteers went through their paces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said the militias would fight any invaders. `` Those powerful ones who think they can come to this territory without getting a whipping are mistaken,'' he said. The master of ceremonies who introduced the general addressed himself to the foreign journalists gathered below him. `` If there is an invasion, you wo n't be filming Panamanian cadavers, but the cadavers of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers that we will send home to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mothers,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> concluded the list of conditions for a U.S.-Panama solution by saying, `` If I have said nothing, it is because I know them -LRB- the Americans -RRB-, and because I know them, I remain silent.''

<TEXT>
 Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> won approval Friday to form a new government after two other leaders failed during a political crisis over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the country's ban on nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Schleuter </PERSON> had hoped for a clear mandate from May 10 parliamentary elections for full Danish participation in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and against a stronger anti-nuclear ban. However, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s center-right coalition merely kept its 70 seats in the 179-member legislature. The two-party socialist opposition lost ground but still holds 79 seats, making it difficult for <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> to form a new government. <PERSON> Schleuter </PERSON>, now caretaker prime minister, was asked to try to form a new government by Queen <PERSON> Margrethe </PERSON> II. `` It's a hard task and far from certain that I will succeed,'' said <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> on Friday. The socialist opposition pushed a resolution through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> April 14 calling on <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s government to notify each visiting warship of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s longstanding peacetime ban on nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Schleuter </PERSON> said he hoped a new government would be in place for the opening of Parliament on Thursday. The non-partisan chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> both failed to forge a ruling coalition among the eight parties elected to the legislature on May 10.

<HEAD>Demonstration Reported in Port City of St. Marc</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A protest against a customs officer's arrival in the port city of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> turned into an anti-government demonstration by more than 5,000 Haitians on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> station reported. It was one of the first demonstrations reported in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> against the government of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> since he was elected president in January. The station said hundreds of protesters took to the streets after learning that a customs officer arrived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> to enforce a government order to stop illegal entry of imported goods into this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island country. The officer ordered a halt to the unloading of cargo ships in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> harbor, about 55 miles northwest of the capital city of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Demonstrators first turned their wrath on the unidentified customs officer. Armed with machetes, sticks, knives and stones, they set up flaming tire barricades and shouted, `` I am going to eat you! I am going to devour you!,'' the station said. Two hours later, the number of protesters swelled to about 5,000 and they turned on the government, shouting, `` Down with <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>!,'' Radio Metropole reported. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> earlier announced he intended to stop the illegal flow of goods into <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> that has flourished since former President-for-life <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into French exile Feb. 7, 1986. The president said his program was aimed at stabilizing the economy of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the poorest nation in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. Although figures have never made public, the contraband helped drive down prices in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> but cut into government tax revenue. Contraband brought to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> comes mostly on ships from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and includes second-hand clothing, canned food, cigarettes, rice, and other consumer goods. Since then, port cities have been the focal point of the government plan. Goods valued at $ 250,000 were confiscated at <LOCATION> Miragoane </LOCATION>, a port city 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Port-of-Prince </LOCATION>. Imported passenger cars were held at other ports until import duties were paid. Radio Haiti-Inter reported two weeks ago that the military stopped merchants from taking possession of goods at the port of <LOCATION> Cap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haitien </LOCATION> on the north coast.

 The <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> family was horrified when they saw a stranger in the casket at a <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION> funeral home and found out that the man they came to mourn had been cremated by mistake, a newspaper reported Friday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, died May 9, as did <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>, 73, of East Haven. Both men were taken first to the morgue at <LOCATION> Yale-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and then to separate branches of <ORGANIZATION> Sisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> funeral homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, a town about 8 miles to the north, the New Haven Register reported. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> was to have been buried May 13 but instead was cremated. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> was to have been cremated, but his body appeared dressed in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>'s suit in an open coffin May 12 during calling hours at the funeral home in <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper. The Eagans Thursday filed a complaint against the funeral home with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and has hired an investigator to find out who made the error, the newspaper reported. `` There had to be an extremely large number of mistakes made in order for this to have happened,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branford </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s three sons, was quoted as saying. `` I would never want another family to have to go through this.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>, one of the funeral home's owners, blamed <ORGANIZATION> Yale-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and said his attorney was preparing to file a complaint against the hospital, the newspaper reported. `` The tags were wrong,'' he was quoted as saying. `` They released the wrong bodies to us.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Urtz </PERSON>, a hospital spokesman, said Friday that the mixup had to have occurred at the funeral home. `` One was taken to the morgue five hours before the other man arrived in the emergency room. These individuals went to the morgue properly tagged and were properly identified,'' he said. A state medical examiner, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, had signed a certificate which had allowed <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s unintended cremation, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the funeral home did not tell her family what had happened and only asked that a relative identify <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>'s body on May 13 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> said her husband found it strange that <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>'s body was dressed in a stranger's suit `` We did n't know where the suit came from. No one had sent it,'' she was quoted as saying. The Eagans' attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Thursday he did not know who was responsible for the mistake but filed a complaint against the funeral home because `` they're the ones that ultimately made the arrangements.'' <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>'s cremated remains were placed in a casket on May 13 by <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> Funeral Home, which replaced <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> brothers at the family's request, and were buried after a funeral mass, the newspaper reported <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> was cremated and a memorial service for him was held at <ORGANIZATION> Sisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported.

 A hospital worker winced and shut his eyes at the pain of a young, bloodied shooting victim in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>'s emergency room, as the little victims of a schoolhouse shooting began arriving Friday. `` It was a big trauma. Everybody was running around,'' said <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatter </PERSON>, a supply technician who was in the emergency room when ambulance drivers said they were coming from the school in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> with four children, victims of the shooting. Both cities are affluent northern suburbs of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It kind of affected me because I've got kids of my own,'' <PERSON> Hatter </PERSON>, 26, said. He said he was especially moved by a young blonde girl who was shot in the wrist and chest. `` She looked like she was fighting for her life; she was rolling back and forth on the cart,'' Hatter said. `` I had to close my eyes a couple times and listen for my next orders.'' Parents of the wounded children were secluded in a room to await word and to avoid reporters. `` In view of these circumstances, they are doing remarkably well,'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchester </PERSON>, a surgeon who operated on some of the children, said of the parents.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The U.S-backed Contras agreed Friday to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s proposed dates for the next round of peace talks, but the two sides suggested different sites. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, said in a phone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that leaders of the Contra rebels will attend two days of peace talks beginning Wednesday, as the government has proposed. He said the rebel leaders will arrive for talks at the border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, where the agreement was reached in March for a 60-day cease-fire lasting until May 30. But Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said in a note to the rebels that the talks must be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. To hold the discussions outside of the capital, he said, `` is to go back in the advances that, with great difficulties, have been achieved'' in the cease-fire talks. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said earlier that the rebels had not yet responded to a government proposal to extend the cease-fire one month past the May 30 deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, ordered <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> to pull off the air until Tuesday a news program that carried an interview with a rebel chief, according to <PERSON> Auxiliadora </PERSON> <PERSON> Echegoyen </PERSON>, director of the program. She said the suspension notice cited `` an interview which we transmitted with a rebel chief, whose pseudonym is Tigrillo, and which we monitored from another radio.'' She did not say which station had originally carried the interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the station should have cleared the interview with the government. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was one of three privately owned radio stations barred from broadcasting news programs earlier this month because it reported a workers' strike. The Sandinista government and the Contras have been blaiming each other for the faltering peace plan to end more than six years of war. Almost two months after the two sides signed the pact, they agree only on the desire to end the fighting. The government has warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the cease-fire is not extended after May 30 or if no progress is made. The Contras, meanwhile, are suffering from infighting, a move that favors the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. From the government's point of view, the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to self-destruct. Pro-Sandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the Contra bickering. The problems surrounding the cease-fire plan appear to have started almost immediately after the March 23 signing. If all had gone according to plan, the war would just about be over and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be well on its way to full democracy. Because the cease-fire plan has not moved forward, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have not freed more than 3,000 political prisoners nor permitted the Contras to have a say in internal politics. Talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an impasse. The meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of support for the strikers. The government responded by saying it would consider whether future talks would be held. According to the cease-fire plan, the first measures should have been completed by April 15. In exchange, the Contra rebels would have gathered in agreed upon cease-fire zones and been permitted to receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization. The Sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food, medicine and clothes distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. But the Contras rejected that, saying the organization sympathizes with the government. Meanwhile, sources said thousands of rebel troops moved toward the northern border. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is providing supplies to the Contras through <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. A group of rebellious Contras has demanded the ouster of the top Contra military officer, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a former officer under the ousted dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, the Contras' main spokesman, said recently the talk of divisions was exaggerated. Nicaraguan Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Sunday that the Contra infighting puts into doubt future cease-fire negotiations. `` In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> the mercenary forces -LRB- the Contras -RRB- are on the verge of civil war,'' he said. `` The political heads that come here to negotiate have very little influence.''

 Trade ministers from leading industrialized countries have set the stage for what some say will be a crucial year-end showdown over a call by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end public subsidies to the world's farmers. Wrapping up two days of talks on world economic issues, the ministers agreed Thursday to work for `` tangible progress'' in liberalizing global trade in agriculture and other fields.

 Big increases in food, energy and clothing costs sent consumer prices up 0.4 percent in April, an annual rate of increase of 5.3 percent, as the country got its second monthly dose of higher inflation, the government reported Friday. Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six years, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight labor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar, analysts said. The April price increase followed a 0.5 percent May advance, which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January 1987. Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is worrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety of areas.

<HEAD>Walters Art Gallery Reopens After $6 Million Overhaul</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art Gallery closed for a $ 6 million overhaul, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Renaissance palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> envisioned for one of the greatest private art collections in the world. The renovation has created for <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' precious jewels, bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> calls a `` seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history. `` In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the collection for the first time,'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said recently, pointing proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure viewers. `` We direct people directly to the object through the lighting.'' The massive stone building with a marble-columned court fashioned after the 17th-century <PERSON> Palazzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Balbi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, is one of six comprehensive museums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the 22,000-piece collection. The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and poorly lighted rooms <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> inherited when he left an art history post at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and arrived here are gone. In their place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask; polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden for centuries. The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more lie in storage. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who made his fortune with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, left the collection _ along with a $ 3 million endowment _ to his native city `` for the benefit of the people.'' The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving 14th-century Italian perspective paintings called `` View of an Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school of <PERSON> Cimabue </PERSON>, the first <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and one of only 12 known paintings by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Goes </PERSON>. Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights, and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> jokingly calls the project a `` modest calling.'' `` We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said. `` To do that was a special project. The building is a work of art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as ceaseless champion of his world-class museum. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> is satisfied with the effort, financed with $ 1 million in city funds, $ 1 million in state funds and another $ 4 million in contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble columns for a consistent look. Going room to room, <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> marvels at the miraculously preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>; a collection of European porcelains considered second only to the British royal collection at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>; and some of the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to art nouveau. The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a French goldsmith's shop for <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' delicate Faberge enamels, an iris corsage ornament created by <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and an ivory orchid comb by <PERSON> Lalique </PERSON>. The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father, who began the collection, had done More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000 visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened gallery included former employees as well as local visitors seasoned by a lifetime of trips. One after another, they stopped <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> to thank him for restoring the collection to splendor. `` Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right thing,'' he said.

 Tigermania is here. The Grammy award-winning <PERSON> Tigres </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>, the kings of northern `` ranchera'' music, are performing the songs that champion struggling, working-class people. At a recent concert, the outdoor arena in this town in the northern border state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> was so tightly packed with fans that those in the front rows had to brace their arms against the stage to keep from being smashed into it. And fans of all ages struggled through the crowd to hand requests and flowers to the five-man band which has sold more than 20 million albums to date. It's their music, after all _ northern `` ranchera,'' polka-style ballads backed by an accordion, two guitars, a saxophone and drums. And for the past 18 years, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, have been making it famous in Latin neighborhoods throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Grammy award for best Mexican-American performance has opened new doors for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION>, they said. And now they're hoping to be able to perform with artists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They won for their Grammy-winning album, `` Gracias ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... Sin Fronteras,'' or `` Thanks ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... Without Borders.'' Their new album, `` Idols of the People,'' contains two songs sung in English and Spanish, marking their first attempt to reach an English-speaking audience. `` It's part of the folklore of the north. It's strictly northern and we do n't want it to die,'' said guitar player <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> about ranchera music. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION> _ brothers <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, cousin <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> and friend <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivo </PERSON> _ have recorded 18 albums and performed in 12 movies based on their songs in the two decades since they moved from northwestern coastal <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> seeking a record contract. `` Our music was n't accepted here in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, the oldest <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> brother at 37 and leader of the band. `` Nobody would put it on the radio.'' Their lyrics speak of national pride and the realities of their lives: `` I'm proud to be called Mexican, because there is nothing else like it,'' one song says. They now are residents of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and record their music there. Just teen-agers at the time they left <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and without a name for the band, an American immigration agent at the border city of <LOCATION> Calexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, `` baptized'' the group `` <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. From working-class families, only <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> finished junior high school and received some formal musical training. They all play music by ear. Tigres producer, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Frinco </PERSON> writes the lyrics and is the major contributer on the melodies. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION> started out singing songs of drug deals gone bad, such as the 1971 hit `` Contraband and Betrayal'' that launched their musical career. Although the drug theme _ the smuggler always dies _ still is prevalent in their music, they often sing about the status of Mexicans living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as their hit, `` The Other <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' nominated last year for a Grammy. `` Do n't criticize me because I live on ` the other side','' the lyrics say. `` I'm not rootless, I live for necessity. `` Already many years since I came as a ` wetback,' `` my customs have n't changed, `` nor my nationality. `` I'm like so many other Mexicans, beaten by life, working under the sun.'' In `` Gracias ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... Sin Fronteras,'' the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of which they sing is all of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the whole continent, and he who is born here is American,'' the song says. But the song also says: `` I was born the color of the earth. By inheritance my language is Spanish. In the north, they call me Latin. They do n't want to call me American.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION> did n't intend to give the impression that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> no longer has borders, or that the group was thanking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for not having borders. `` It's a little confusing,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who added that fans often request the song `` America Without Borders.'' `` Our idea was to make it known to the people that buy our albums that they should feel American,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigres </LOCATION> said they were kicked out of restaurants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they spoke only Spanish when they first began touring in the 1970s. They say Mexican-Americans still are made to feel like second-class citizens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Our songs tell Mexicans that they can triumph in other countries,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, `` and not just as laborers, but looking for the best opportunities the country has to offer.'' All married and with children, their music in recent years has included the theme of Mexican-American children and their identity with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In `` The Gold Cage,'' the father speaks in Spanish and the child in English. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the best thing about receiving the award is that it's focused more attention on the group. `` To be Mexican and be able to show it to the rest of the world is the best there is,'' he said.

 Are things really that bad? Is the economy ready to swell into inflation and plunge into recession? Are interest rates about to soar? Are we helpless against the enemy? Or are there tools for dealing with problems? During the past week, a cloud of pessimism descended upon those who look into the future. It blotted out the sun and obscured vision, and it induced a lot of people into stating that the dark ages had returned. Good news became bad news. Small, fractional increases in various economic measurements were projected to the extreme. Tools to contain inflation, soften recession or keep interest rates in check suddenly seemed useless. Contradictions were presented as wisdom. If interest rates were to soar, for instance, how could the economy simultaneously turn into a runaway bull? Would n't the sky-high interest rates prevent that? Faith was abandoned. What ever happened, for example, to the notion that growth need n't be inflationary if based on productivity gains? Or that the economy could be influenced by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, albeit with great limits? What became of restraint? Does a small increase in interest rates mean that huge increases will follow and persist for years? Or that the economy will pitch forward into the worst recession ever? A lot has to do with the perspective, and that perspective has been marked for years by wariness, weariness, doubt and probably mean-spiritedness. Economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> says one reason for the gloomy perspective is that supply-side economics was supposed to fail; the recovery was n't supposed to happen and interest rates and inflation were n't supposed to fall. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a securities firm, says that positive events have left so many forecasters with egg on their faces that it is hard for them to be pleased with the economic recovery. It is similar in the securities markets, as described by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION>. He observes that `` two of the casualties of the stock market crash last October were analysis and imagination.'' Rather than assessing the interplay of forces for change and the inertia of the status quo, he says, a `` great deal of energy has been expended in trying to force the present into some historical mold.'' It wo n't fit, he says. `` Chronicling the surface similarities between now and 1929 was an amusing exercise, but it has lost its persuasiveness since the economy has refused to contract. `` Therefore, the hunt is on for another analogy, this time including overheating and inflation. The analysis and imagination brought to bear involve annualizing the last numbers.'' That is, extrapolating them to the extreme. Nobody knows what the economy holds in store. It might be recession. It might be high interest rates. It could mean lower stock prices. And all these possibilities could be faced in the extreme. But if all this happens you may be sure that recovery will follow. If there is one thing known for certain about all industrial economies it is that they are cyclical. Ups and downs precede and follow each other. While today's consensus seems to view the world through dark glasses, you can still find some rose-tinted views, such as this encouraging observation from <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, publisher of the newsletter Investment Horizons. He writes: `` Do not be frightened by bear markets. On the contrary, since they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the shares of good companies at bargain prices you should view bear markets in a favorable light. `` Remember, the only time you want stock prices to be at their peak is the day you plan to sell. In the meantime, you should be glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on sale.''

 The nation's first law making recycling mandatory across a state has forced <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> residents to become more intimate with their trash. No longer can one toss the chicken bones, the baby food jars and the bean cans into the garbage bag and forget about them. Recycling is n't just for Boy Scouts operating Saturday newspaper collections anymore. To 79-year-old <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, this means converting her kitchen into a mini recycling center. She has to collect newspapers, bottles and garbage in separate containers and then remember which day to carry each bag downstairs for pickup. `` Well, for us old folks it's a pest,'' she said, adding, `` I guess we can struggle through if we have to.'' Her resigned acceptance is echoed across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as county governments tackle the logistical difficulties of recycling and residents contend with separating coffee grounds from cans and soaking labels off bottles. `` It's not pleasant, and to tell you the truth, it's a pain in the neck. But it has to be done,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of Fair Haven. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Krulick </PERSON>, an 11-year-old from <LOCATION> Manalapan </LOCATION> whose chores include most of his family's recycling, said he hears many similar complaints from the grown-ups around him. `` They think it's a pain in the neck, but it's worth it,'' he concluded. `` It's a good law because you're throwing away a resource, but it's a lot better to use it again.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s law was the most sweeping in the nation when it was signed by Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in April 1987. It requires every community to compost leaves and recycle three materials, chosing from aluminum, glass, tin, plastic and newspapers. By the end of 1988, all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 567 communities are scheduled to be recycling. Under a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> law that took effect last fall, communities must recycle trash or be charged higher rates at the state landfill. Most towns are planning to avoid the higher rates by refusing to pick up residents' garbage that is not recycled. So far, two of the state's 39 communities have launched pilot programs and 16 more are scheduled to begin by the end of the year. Connecticut enacted a more comprehensive measure in July 1987 requiring nearly a dozen materials to be recycled, but it is not scheduled to be in full force until 1991. In early May, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> signed a mandatory recycling law that requires all communities to recycle by late 1992. Oregon has a law requiring recycling in larger communities, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is considering a similar statute. The state recycling laws have been spurred by the need to ease solid waste burdens on dwindling landfill space. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is probably feeling the pinch of the solid waste crisis harder than other states because of its limited landfill space,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roumpf </PERSON>, publisher of the Oregon-based trade magazine `` Resource Recyling.'' `` Unfortunately, we tend to be crisis-oriented,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, the recycling coordinator in <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, which has faced soaring rates for dumping garbage at landfills as space became more scarce. <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>' pilot program for 220 homes allows residents to mix their glass and metal waste, and bundle their newspapers separately. `` The easier it is for the people, the more cooperation you're going to see By letting them co-mingle the waste, we meet about half the resistance,'' said <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. `` We're trying a pilot because we do n't want to make an 8,000-home mistake.'' Implementation has not been without some hitches. Officials report problems with curbside scavengers stealing valuable aluminum, which is commanding up to 50 cents a pound. Midnight dumpers have dropped unwanted couches and refrigerators at community recycling centers. <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION> communities are gearing up for seasonal problems when vacationers are likely to ignore local recycling pickup schedules. Other towns have encountered problems with waste haulers who get paid by the ton and cart away garbage, even if it is improperly loaded with newspapers and glass. Still others say they have heard of residents bragging that they circumvent the law simply by sticking to plastic bags that ca n't be seen through. State Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Contillo </PERSON>, who created the law, said he wants to revise it to eliminate loopholes and make it easier to go into the recycling business. At the same time, he said, the state must avoid opening the field to organized crime, which controls some waste haulers. Another obstacle has been generating markets for the recycled plastics. The state must report back to the legislature by the end of the year on what steps have been made. Many local recycling coordinators say compliance has been good. But residents continue to grumble. Some complain the new law makes them giftwrap their garbage, and others grow angry when their rubbish is left by the curb because a hauler spotted a wayward glass jar. `` There's always going to be maybe 5 percent of the people who feel you are asking them to do something they should not have to do because they're paying their taxes,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the coordinator in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Roumpf </PERSON> said the resistance is no surprise. She cited opinion polls showing most people support recycling `` like they support apple pie and motherhood'' _ until they are asked whether they recycle or if they would want to.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He's no bird. He's no plane. And in the first issue he makes the mistake of trying to rescue Superman. He's `` The Tick,'' a clumsy, muscle-bound comic book superhero in a tick costume who has escaped from a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> insane asylum to become the protector of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The Tick'' is also the first publishing venture of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION>, a bookstore chain anchored in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that is thriving on a resurgent national interest in comic books. Comic books have come of age along with their readers. Old favorites are being remodeled, and a new generation of adult comics takes chances with art, content and subtle humor. Vivid drawings are richly detailed and often seem charged with an electric current. `` It's exploded,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, a 33-year-old accountant who co-founded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Comics five years ago. `` Comics are being read by more and more of the general population. It used to be you did n't admit you read comics if you were over 13.'' Comic books are proliferating in a way not seen since the early 1950s when readership was estimated at 4 million. But it's not all the same old <PERSON> Superman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> that generated $ 300 million in retail sales last year. `` Wonder Woman,'' for instance, created in 1941 and published by <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION>, recently relocated to intellectual <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and took as her mentor an archaeologist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Her new artist and writer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, is 33 and based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He consulted with former Ms. magazine editor <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> before modernizing Wonder Woman. `` I try to hold on to some fans, trying to ` adultify' her without ignoring our younger reader,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who said Wonder Woman has soared out of a slump to become one of <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION>'s top five sellers. `` Wonder Woman is most definitely a feminist, or a humanist, in no uncertain terms,'' he said. `` Her prime goal in life is to teach peaceful coexistence and equality.'' Other adult comics include <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> Cat Dancer, which deals with male-female relationships, and the Punisher, about a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran whose adventures address such contemporary issues as drugs and white-collar crime on Wall Street. Comic books emerged in 1933 as an evolutionary offshoot of comic strips, neatly reflecting the churnings of American popular culture. In the mid-1950s, comic books were widely read for their detailed and energetic violence and often moralistic messages railing against war and racism. But their very popularity frightened people, and in a <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> era backlash, comic books were accused of causing juvenile delinquency. Senate hearings were held. The industry retreated and comic book publishers instituted self-censorship with the <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Code </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. With comic books tamed, their audience shrank. Comic books began to recover, however, in the'60s when products of the baby boom toddled off to college and found the superheros waiting for them. Like everything else, that revival of mainstream fare also had its anti-establishment variety in underground `` comix,'' with their stories about hippies, long-haired motorcyclists and loose sex. Zap Comics and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers were among the stars of the underground comix market. The future computer scientists, engineers, defense analysts and psychologists who read those comic books still buy them. But their tastes have aged. `` Today's comics readers expect more, they expect depth of character,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, who is earning a doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the history of American civilization and is a student of comics. `` They want earthy realism, like the way <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> blends werewolves with Burger King.'' These grown-up comic books can be read on two levels, he said. `` It's sort of like <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. You can have fun, or you can say this thing is coming down the river and what does it mean?'' Comic books have eclipsed stamps, coins and wine as collectible investments, according to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weist </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> comic book collector and dealer for 28 years. However, while <PERSON> Weist </PERSON> estimated the number of collectors today at around 250,000 million, he said few will make anywhere near the $ 60,000 fetched in the past year by a single mint-condition issue of the first Marvel Comics. `` A lot of it has gotten out of hand,'' he said. `` Collecting is risky. ... Stamps, coins and wines have been around for three centuries and they will outlast comic books.'' <PERSON> Weist </PERSON> predicted that the cheap paper on which comics are printed will not allow them to last, and in 50 or 75 years those precious early copies of <PERSON> Superman </PERSON> and the others wo n't be worth holding on to. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area is thick with stores that specialize in the higher-priced comic books than run from 75 cents to $ 15 and supplement newsstand offerings. That's the story around the country, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, the country's biggest comic book distributor, carrying every one of the approximately 400 titles available. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the average comic book reader is a 20-year-old male, although about 20 percent of comic book fans are older. He estimates there are just half a million regular readers of comics, about 5 percent of them female. `` These are an example of the growing sophistication of comic books as an art form in the past five to 10 years,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` In a way, that may be a result of the fact that the baby boom is growing older. `` Comics today are better than they ever have been. Comics have grown up.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Play Becomes a Movie</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If it bombed in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, will it play in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON> hopes so. At one theater in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the entire audience walked out on <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON>'s new anti-apartheid film, `` Saturday Night at the Palace.'' Now he's looking for a more sympathetic crowd in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` People could n't take it,'' <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON> said of the movie's South African run `` It's kind of like showing a movie of someone dying of lung cancer to an audience who are all heavy smokers. It's so real and so close. The movie is based on a real event _ a rampage by two white men at a black-run roadhouse on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. It was made into a play that ran in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON>, 40, who wrote the successful play on which the film is based, plays <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>, a white racist who winds up at a diner late one night with his nerd of a roommate, <PERSON> Forsie </PERSON>. The black manager of the roadhouse, played by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> Award-winning actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kani </PERSON>, is just closing up for the night. <PERSON> Forsie </PERSON> wants only to use the telephone, but <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> demands that the manager, whose name is September, reopen for business. In a scene that encompasses the last half of the movie, an increasingly ugly confrontation pits the characters, in shifting allegiances, against one another. The movie, produced and directed by South African <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, is a catharsis of sorts for <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON>, who based <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>'s character _ loud, abusive, violent _ on some of the people with whom he grew up in a small South African town The son of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants, he moved to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when he was 3 years old. `` I grew up in a kind of white racist area _ the attitudes were very deep,'' he said in a recent interview. `` And when I went to college -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... I was studying alongside blacks and meeting them socially, and it was a stunning transformation. Because all of the prejudices I'd grown up with suddenly melted away, and I realized I'd been living in the middle of this kind of lie. `` I ca n't watch the movie,'' he said. `` I just slide down in my seat and I'm praying for someone to get rid of this guy -LRB- <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> -RRB-. It's just too much _ it assaults and assaults and assaults. But in a way it's a story that has to be told.'' At one point in the film, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>, the unemployed roustabout, delivers a monologue that frames the movie's political message. Enraged at the stubborn gentility of September, he roars, `` Who's he to be in charge of a roadhouse when I'm out of work? Everywhere you go, all you see is black faces. Bus drivers, bank tellers _ bloody three-piece suits, man!'' Apartheid, says <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON>, `` comes from the soul of that kind of character. It comes from fear _ it's a fear of being swamped.'' `` This character, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON>, has, I think, the central line of the -LRB- film -RRB- when he says, ` My old man said if you let a black man get the better of you, that's the end, you're finished; there's no going back.' That's his belief.'' This is a heady time for Slabolepszy and others in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s artistic community. A series of hit plays have emerged from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> _ `` Master <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> ... and the Boys,'' `` Sarafina,'' `` <PERSON> Woza </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>,'' among others. South African music has become an international rage and there is an emergence of black South African art and literature. `` History is happening,'' said <PERSON> Slabolepszy </PERSON>, who yearns to someday `` make a picture of hope.'' Perhaps, he muses, there will be a `` happy accident'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In the meantime, he finds his drama in turmoil.

 Chinese first came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as cooks and launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they flying in from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and real estate. For the large majority, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is a hedge against <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997 While <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> entrepreneurs find easy entry under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s `` investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> in British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> report an increase the number of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> women who come to have babies because the infants automatically become Canadian citizens Other Chinese come as students and professionals. But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome. `` They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> $ 4 million -RRB- for a house because in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it would be 20 million -LRB- $ 16 million -RRB-,'' said Premier <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. One recent buyer was <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, whose casino and ferry empire in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> makes him one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest men. He paid 5.5 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 4.4 million -RRB- for a 25-room mansion on Bridle Path, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s millionaire's row. Across the country in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ka-shing </PERSON>, whose companies represent 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, won the bidding in April for the right to develop the choice 210-acre site of Expo'86. Through his 25-year-old son, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, a Canadian citizen, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> plans to spend $ 1.6 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into `` Pacific Place,'' a high-rise complex that will consist of a 24-hour global financial center, a 400-room hotel, manmade islands with 10,000 housing units and a 630-berth marina. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and his son also control 52 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 12th largest oil company, and his <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought the ailing <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> this past November. Officials estimate the current flow of Chinese investment at $ 1.6 billion a year, half of it in real estate. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> own one-third of the shopping malls in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, one of three metropolitan Chinatowns. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hou </PERSON>, a Canadian-Chinese community leader, said his real estate company deals with 100 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investors a month. After the first Chinese came for the gold rush and later to work on the construction of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of $ 50 a head on new arrivals. Those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947. Today, 600,000 Canadians are of Chinese descent, including more than 200,000 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and 175,000 in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. At any one time, 18,000 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> students are enrolled at Canadian universities. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has become the leading source of immigrants to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, with 22,100 visas issued last year. `` I came in 1967,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, a 65-year-old <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> real estate magnate who has donated more than $ 5 million to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> universities and the Sun Yat-sen Classical Chinese Garden in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, a replica of the ancient gardens of <LOCATION> Suzhou </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> pulled off the biggest real estate deal in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>'s history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for other <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investors `` Now we're seeing more than just flight capital,'' <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There's a second strata of people, young professionals who see the writing on the wall for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and are afraid.'' The Chinese Communists have agreed to allow <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of sovereignty, but many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> are hedging against that. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is seen as desirable because of its political stability and large <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> population.'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> realtor. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s `` investor immigrant'' program offers a visa in exchange for investment of 150,000 Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 121,500 -RRB- to 500,000 dollars -LRB- $ 405,000 -RRB- in approved businesses. Government figures show <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investment under the program totaled 776 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 628 million -RRB- last year and created 4,500 jobs.

<HEAD>Short Sellers, `Bear Raiders' New Subject of Post-Crash Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the search for stock saboteurs and bear-market villains hiding in the aftermath of the October crash, a new group of suspects has emerged _ the short sellers, investors who bet money that prices will drop. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> have quietly been probing allegations that improper short selling may have contributed to the crash, though evidence of wrongdoing has n't yet emerged. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the over-the-counter market, is considering whether to implement restrictions on short selling. In addition, several companies have raised a post-crash clamor about alleged manipulation of their stock by users of the trading tactic. The head of one such company, <ORGANIZATION> Urgent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is co-sponsoring a conference Monday on short selling, titled `` Is Anyone Really Safe?'' Short selling in itself is n't a crime. In theory, short sellers sell borrowed stock they believe is overvalued, on the hunch the price will decline. Potential profits can be immense. For example, if a short seller borrows 100 shares at $ 1 a share and sells them, he earns $ 100 and uses the money as collateral for the borrowed shares. If the stock drops to 50 cents a share, the short seller buys 100 shares, returns the borrowed stock and pockets $ 50. Defenders of short selling argue that it injects liquidity into the market and helps all investors more accurately determine whether a touted stock is worth buying or not. `` Selling short enables market participants to adjust positions and causes stock to be more responsive,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, head of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think short selling has a lot of positive attributes.'' Critics say short selling can be disastrous to fledgling companies trying to raise capital, especially in the post-crash environment when so many investors already are avoiding the stock market. `` There's nothing illegal about selling short if you think a company is going to be in decline. What's bad is when people deliberately circulate adverse information that may be false for the purpose of causing a stock to go down,'' said <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner and securities lawyer in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bockius </PERSON>. Foes of short selling often recall how the strategy was widely abused after Crash of 1929, when it played a central role in the `` Bear Raids'' in which speculators would relentlessly gang up on a target company, spreading lies about it to drive down the stock price. Such abuses led the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> to implement the short-sale rule, also known as the uptick rule, which theoretically prevents short sellers from mercilessly depressing a stock price. Under the rule, a short sale may be executed only if the previous sale moved the stock up at least -LRB- point, or one `` tick.'' But there are strategies for sidestepping this rule, and a debate has intensified on whether it works. Moreover, the stocks most susceptible to short-selling assaults have n't been protected by the uptick rule, since they are usually small, over-the-counter issues such as upstart high-technology or research concerns. These stocks soared in value in the 1982-87 bull market and became visible targets for short sellers. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urgent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, for example, founder <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> has contended that short sellers tried to destroy his company by spreading vicious rumors about its management. The stock of <ORGANIZATION> Carrington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a drug firm working on a substance that could advance treatment for AIDS, sank after false rumors surfaced that the company was prohibited from testing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>'s management claims short sellers spread the rumors. Still, many investment professionals believe the argument against short selling is n't persuasive and that further regulation would make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock markets less attractive. `` We're not going to try to defend anybody who lies about a company to knock its stock down. That's wrong,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a short-selling strategist who publishes the Overpriced Stock Service Newsletter. `` But 98 percent of the effort in the securities business is aimed at touting stocks. There's far, far more lying pushing stocks up then pushing them down.'' The real effect of short sellers, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> argues, is to expose companies that have serious deficiencies. `` People say short selling is un-American. But it's the reason <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has the best capital market in the world,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` You need to get a lot of opinions into the market.''

 There is something so sad about the rows of graves freshly cut into the bright green grass. Something so wrong about magnolias coming alive in these days of mourning. Spring is a time of rebirth and renewal. A week ago, the children of <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION> were planning their summers, playing ball, practicing the trumpet. But these have been seven days of sorrow. Each day, tears. And one question with no answer: Why? Most of the children, many of them classmates, were buried in the warming soil this past week, seven days after their church bus was hit head-on by a pickup truck heading the wrong way on the interstate highway. The pickup driver, who police said was drunk, has been charged with 27 counts of murder _ one for each of 24 children and three adults. It was one of the nation's worst bus crashes and every parent's worst nightmare In this Army town, next to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, these have been seven days in which faith has been tested, dreams destroyed and pain endured. `` The shock really has n't worn off,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattingly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, which lost 13 members. `` It's going to take a long, long time to heal the hurt.''

 It began as a journey home, the end of a day's outing at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. It ended in the still of the night May 14 on Interstate 71. At 10:55 p.m., the bus was near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, 100 miles from home, heading south when it was rammed by the pickup, driven by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, traveling north on the wrong side of the road. Tests showed his blood-alcohol level was 2 -LCB- times the legal limit. The collision ruptured the bus gas tank, turning the front of the vehicle into a smoky fireball. Screaming, panicked children piled on top of each other in their struggle to escape. With 67 people inside, the front door blocked by flames and just one working door in back, dozens were trapped. Many were saved. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 14, died a hero _ pushing his critically burned brother, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, 13, out a window. `` He loved his family and his little brother,'' recalled <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, wife of the pastor of the First Assembly of God. By the time Trooper <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> arrived half an hour later, helicopters had ferried some of the injured to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, about 50 miles away. `` There was quietness, somberness,'' he recalled. `` There was smoke, the heavy stench of death from the remains. `` Being a father and a parent,'' he said, `` it hurts so much more when you see young people, teen-agers, so many of them dead at one particular scene.''

 For the 27 dead, the trip home finally ended three days later in a procession of gray hearses from <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, traveling the same route the bus would have taken. At the accident site, someone has since placed a cross of pink plastic flowers. The grim task of identification took two days. Dental records were used for most, clothing, shoes and jewelry for others. Most bodies were taken to the <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION> area; others went to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. It took nearly four hours for all the hearses to leave. Departures were staggered to ease the pain. `` The idea of seeing a bunch of hearses in front of the funeral home ... we thought would be devastating to the community,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> funeral director who helped out. `` I can not identify with those families,'' he said softly. `` I have not lost a child. It is normal for them to start thinking about their children burying them in 40 or 50 years. They are suddenly having to bury their own children. ... How can anybody deal with it?''

 Talking. Day and night, people have met at churches, schools and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, where a 24-hour crisis phone line was set up. Seventeen of those killed had some link to the Army post. A sergeant lost his entire family: his wife _ a childhood sweetheart _ and his two daughters. `` If you're in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the job is to do a soldier's work,'' said Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagles </PERSON>, a spokesman. `` That might include getting killed. -LRB- But -RRB- the children have been killed. Everything you've trained for _ all that is out the window. Every day people ask why _ a question with no answer. ` They're confused,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, who counseled students at one middle school. `` They want to know why <PERSON> God </PERSON> let that happen.'' There is anger, too, he said. `` At the same time, that anger is mixed with a feeling of pity for the driver _ human justice will never be able to do anything worse than having him -LRB- live -RRB- with the memory of what happened.''

 They are now names and faces in the newspapers. A week ago, they were sons and daughters, husbands and wives, leading quiet lives. Each has a story. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 10, whose sister and mother were also killed, played her first softball game last week. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 13, a drummer, was to play in his first concert Monday. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, 14, was baptized on Easter last month. And <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, 13, `` just wanted everybody to be happy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>. `` She did n't want anybody to be hurt. And she loved to play her trumpet.'' And then there's <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>, the bus driver who died trying to save his passengers. His 14-year-old daughter was critically injured. Neighbors remember <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> from the child they held in their arms to the man who grew to be a soldier in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> circuit court clerk, member of the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, he was ordained as a minister at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> loved children, attended softball games with his girls and `` would n't have left that bus with one person on it,'' said his uncle, state Sen. <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>. Ironically, he said, <PERSON> John </PERSON> was always the one who consoled mourners. `` He always had the right words to say and was always the person who took over.''

 Praying. All week, mourners have come to the Assembly of God, where scores of arrangements of roses, lilies and chrysanthemums from across the nation are lined up at the altar. The church has received nearly 1,000 letters, some from young children expressing their condolences. Folks here hold fast to their religion. `` This is a time you have to draw on your faith,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON>, whose 16-year-old son escaped the bus. Mrs. <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>'s son also got out safely. `` Someone pushed him out of the back door,'' she said. `` I'd rather say he's blessed than lucky. God just blessed us.'' This week, the funerals will be over. The anguish will remain. `` The worst is yet to come,'' said <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>. `` As families try to get back to their ordinary lives, there's not going to be those friends and that support. They will get over it. Time's the only thing that heals the wounds.''

 Lawmakers are accusing the authors of a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report on financial markets of ignoring the exchanges' wildly swerving behavior and the resulting flight of small investors from Wall Street.

<HEAD>Ministers Set Stage For Year-End Showdown In Farm Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ministers from leading industrialized countries have set the stage for what some said would be a crucial year-end showdown over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call for ending public subsidies to the world's farmers. After two days of talks on trade and other world economic issues, the ministers agreed Thursday to work for `` tangible progress'' in liberalizing global trade in agriculture and other fields. Liberalizing the rules of trade generally is considered a crucial step for ensuring the long-term health of the world economy. A key aim is to suppress tendencies by some nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting brought together trade and finance ministers from the 24 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The ministers said they would try by December to agree on a `` framework approach'' to the trade negotiations, which were launched in September 1986 under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The 96-nation <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which sets and monitors world trade rules, has scheduled a December ministerial meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to review progress in the talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the December meeting must produce agreement on the long-term goal of the farm trade talks, as well as a `` road map'' and timetable for reaching that goal. All major industrial countries agree that government subisidies to farmers have grown too large, but they do n't agree on how to correct the problem. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, told Thursday's meeting that all industrialized countries are guilty of excessive aid to farmers `` We are all milking our taxpayers to force-feed our cows, paying huge subsidies to make two blades of wheat grow where one is more than enough,'' he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, said government aid to farming in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> alone was costing them 3 million jobs _ equivalent to the entire population of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. A main sticking point in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> farm negotiations is <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> resistance to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for phasing out all trade-distorting farm subsidies by the end of the century. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s top trade official, said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, or Common Market, would never agree to eliminate such subsidies, although it favors unspecified reductions. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> believes some government aid is needed to protect farmers' incomes and to keep enough people living in rural areas. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special trade representative, acknowledged differences in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European approaches but said officials from both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> were `` basically on the same wavelength.'' He added that the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> meeting would be difficult if <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> did not agree with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that the December talks should produce tangible results on farm policy reform. Austrialian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said the December meeting would be crucial to the prospects for success in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> trade talks, which are expected to last at least until 1990. `` If there are no constructive results -LRB- in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> -RRB- there could be a great loss of confidence'' among the participating governments, he said. Officials from other countries sought to play down the differences. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting `` found some middle ground that all sides can live with,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s finance minister. `` We're setting ourselves clear objectives for the next few months.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Facing an apparent trend toward unified standards among computer giants, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney is seeking to organize a nationwide coalition representing up to 20,000 corporate computer users to call attention to their needs. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, head counsel for a group of customers of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans a meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with representatives of at least a dozen similar groups connected to other computer firms, including <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed coalition of user groups would establish a stronger voice and greater clout for users concerning development of new software systems, said <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. It also would serve as a liaison between the computer users and the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said. A user group is an umbrella organization composed of companies using the same type of computer system. The members generally use the group to share information and express concerns to individual manufacturers. `` You look at the articles written about the computer industry and there is hardly any mention of users, and users are what it is all about,'' said <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, who also serves as counsel for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` There is no voice now for the users. There are some years of chaos ahead until this issue of a standard operating system is settled. It's time the users should be united.'' On Tuesday, four American and three European computers announced formation of a joint $ 90 million project to create a software package modeled after the Unix operating system by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. Unix, which controls the basic operation of a computer, has been sought by <ORGANIZATION> non-AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T customers because it allows computers from different manufacturers to use the same programs. `` If we're moving in the direction of a standard, then it's vital we make our presence known,'' said <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> `` It would be too costly to have a system we ca n't live with. Leverage is important.'' Others agreeing to attend the Monday meeting include representatives of the user groups for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> would not name the other user groups planning to attend the meeting Several computer industry analysts question the feasibility of a nationwide coalition of user groups. `` It would be noble cause, but I'm pretty skeptical it could succeed because there are too many vested interests among the users,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Djurdjevic </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Annex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` On the other hand,'' he said, `` there is a strong need for the user to speak in unison rather than be led by vendor interest. Users have generally been meek and mild and non-confrontational, and this has actually hurt them right in the pocketbooks.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geran </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the push toward connectivity among different computer systems could unite users in the future, but the variety of needs may pull apart the proposed coalition `` What's good for one user is not good for another at this point,'' said <PERSON> Geran </PERSON>. `` It seems there are just too many applications and needs to unite the users.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cashways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says takeover strategist <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and his partners _ who control 7.6 percent of the building materials retailer and may make a takeover offer _ have `` nothing to contribute to this company.'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sutherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber-Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, disclosed Thursday they had bought about 2.56 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest building materials retailer. With about 33.66 million shares outstanding, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City-based <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> has a market value of about $ 728 million based on Thursday's closing price. <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 21.62 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. The Edelman-Sutherland holdings were disclosed in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, one of the family members who runs privately-held <ORGANIZATION> Sutherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no comment on a block of 519,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> stock that was traded Thursday. If the block went to the investment group, that would boost its stake to about 9.2 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that `` in our view, Mr. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and his group have nothing to contribute to this company or its shareholders, nor do we believe the reported plan to dismantle the company serves any constructive purpose.'' The Edelman group said in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it would consider selling <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> operations as `` going concerns'' in many regions of the country. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> called it a `` possibility'' that his company would acquire at least some of the Payless operations that would be sold. `` Our expertise in management is part of the partnership'' with <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> has 194 retail facilities in 23 states and reported 1987 revenue of $ 1.7 billion. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> board of directors approved a complex shareholder rights plan last week to `` protect shareholders from attempts to acquire control of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> at an inadequate price.'' <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> noted the board said the plan was intended to `` encourage'' buyers to negotiate with the board before attempting a takeover. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said his father has had a business relationship with <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> for several years. He said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, the company's chief executive officer, serves on the boards of directors of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockyards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Intelogic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> along with <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who has large investments in these companies. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has launched unsuccessful takeover bids for a gamut of companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, earning millions in the process. He acquired the restaurant chain <ORGANIZATION> Ponderosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> but is believed to have made no profit when he sold it. National Home Center News, an industry trade publication, recently ranked <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> the third-largest building materials and do-it-yourself retailer in the nation. The magazine ranked Sutherland Lumber ninth, with estimated annual revenue of about $ 650 million. <ORGANIZATION> Sutherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION>'s 86 stores are concentrated in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South. In an investment report last month, <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> noted <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> had been considered a potential takeover target for three years. <PERSON> Sutro </PERSON> contended an acquirer could boost its earnings instantly by closing down a score of Payless stores in the depressed oil patch region, where sales were off 45 percent last year. <PERSON> Sutro </PERSON> also said pieces of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>, such as its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> operation, could be sold at `` substantial premiums ... After some paring, an acquiror could still retain a major national presence in the industry through 125-150 profitable, well-located stores.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks strongly supporting program trading have prompted <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its recent move to halt its use of the controversial strategy, the firm says Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, one of several major Wall Street firms to reduce their program trading activity, will `` re-examine its position'' in light of <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks and other factors, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>' chairman and chief executive officer, said Thursday. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> went further than four other investment firms when it announced last week it would stop index arbitrage _ a major form of program trading _ not only for its own accounts but also for its customers. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> halted index arbitrage for their own accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was at least partly responsible for the stock market's volatility. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee, said Thursday that excessive restriction of index arbitrage would limit market liquidity and tend to destabilize the market. He said `` insufficient arbitrage between cash and futures can be a destabilizing force in a declining market.'' In index arbitrage, traders use computers to buy or sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to help them profit from brief price discrepancies. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that `` reduced arbitrage implies less connection between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across these markets.'' He also said, `` it is a mistake to single out one segment of the broad marketplace as the culprit for large and rapid price movements.'' Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON><PERSON> ' </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said his firm had been `` monitoring closely the action and the liquidity problems of the stock market for the past week.'' He also pointed to other firms' `` suspension of index arbitrage activity for themselves but -LRB- continuation of -RRB- those activities for customers'' as further reason for the firm to re-evaluate its position. `` If we do decide to re-enter index arbitrage, we will consider limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to sell on an uptick in the stocks involved,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said in a statement.

<HEAD>Pressure Off Steel Wages, But Not Work Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new buoyancy in the long-floundering steel industry has eased downward pressure on blue-collar wages, but companies will continue demanding cost-saving changes in work rules, companies and analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union representative told him recently that 1989 `` will not be a concession year. `` I guess with the industry looking better they have a right to say that,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters during the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Even at <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, `` there's not been tremendous pressure from creditors to cut labor costs,'' President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said Thursday. Those remarks and others could hearten <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members who retreated on wages, benefits and featherbedding work rules in two rounds of bargaining since 1982. Contracts at the major producers are due for renegotiation beginning next year. `` If we have a somewhat inflationary labor increase in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. I think the stock market would overlook it,'' said securities analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Plant closings and automation have combined with contract givebacks to help cut labor costs for a ton of shipped steel from $ 262 in 1982 to $ 160 last year That shift lessened the impact of wages on production costs. `` Also we have had fairly fearsome increases in wages abroad,'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said Thursday during a panel discussion. `` In <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year they had a 23 percent wage increase, and the Korean won increased on the order of 10 percent.'' Analyst <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said that with no signs of rampant inflation, wage increases would not necessarily hurt steel companies, which are enjoying a recovery of uncertain duration after five years of devastating losses. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was more concerned about wage hikes and encouraged managers to offer stock or a share of profits to workers instead of `` just another escalation of wage costs.'' <PERSON> Willaims </PERSON> said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> negotiators realize `` we're not out of the woods yet.'' He stressed the need for further work rule changes that would `` foster more efficient job combinations, reduce idle time and allow greater flexibiliy in job assignments.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said each job eliminated through work rule changes saves as much as a 10 percent cut in labor costs for 15 workers. Labor costs _ including wages, benefits, unemployment insurance, pension payments and other costs _ peaked for blue-collar steel workers in 1982 at $ 26.29 per hour and declined to an average of $ 23.70 last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION>. Blue-collar employment fell from about 190,000 in 1982 to 121,000 in 1987.

<HEAD>Beazer Group Says 75 Percent Of Koppers Stock Owned Or Tendered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The investor group waging a $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover offer for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it controls or has been tendered more than three-quarters of the company's outstanding common shares. The group led by the British construction company <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stated Thursday that about 73.2 percent of outstanding common shares and about 68.7 percent of outstanding preferred shares had been tendered as of Wednesday under its $ 60 a share tender offer. The group also extended its tender offer through midnight EDT Wednesday. The common shares tendered, together with 2.1 million common shares already owned by related entities, represent about 75.2 percent of the outstanding common shares, the Beazer group indicated. The group must acquire 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' shares in order to complete the deal under the anti-takeover law in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated. Right now, the group may not purchase <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' shares under terms of federal court injunctions in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It appealed the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ruling to the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but a decision has not been announced. Also Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said he would hold a hearing May 31 on the question of whether the hostile bid violates federal securities rules. The hearing specifically will address whether the $ 540 million of preferred securities that the group plans to issue to <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> in return for $ 540 million of its financing should be considered stock or debt. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said the tender offer as currently structured must be permanently enjoined if the stock in question is found to be a debt security. If that is the case, the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group could restructure the financing to comply with regulations.

<HEAD>Castle &amp; Cooke Raises Stake In Amfac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 807.7 million leveraged buyout apparently was a move to stave off a takeover threat by <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking to sharply raise its stake in the company, analysts say. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> on Thursday raised its holdings in <LOCATION> Amfac </LOCATION> to 7.3 percent from 4.9 percent, and said it had received federal clearance to buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly 17.2 million outstanding common shares. Castle & amp; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> owns another 2.6 percent share of <LOCATION> Amfac </LOCATION>, according to documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> management proposed its $ 41 a share buyout offer on Wednesday to the company's board of directors. The company's stock soared $ 6.75 to $ 45.12 -LCB- a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, indicating speculation a higher offer would emerge. Castle & amp; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> stock closed at $ 24.75, up 50 cents a share. The buyout would be led by <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who has said it would strengthen the company's ability to develop <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> asset base `` in a paced and profitable manner.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified services company with main lines of business in food processing, hotels and resorts, retail, agriculture and property. It had revenue of $ 2.2 billion last year. Castle & amp; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> has operations in food production, through its <ORGANIZATION> Dole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> company </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest pineapple producer; transportation equipment leasing; and real estate development. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s largest landowner, while <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> is No. 2. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, who has made his reputation by buying and turning around failing companies, met with <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> officials in January to talk over a real estate venture <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> did not pursue, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> filing said. <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> proposed merging some of his property into <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for <LOCATION> Amfac </LOCATION> stock. Securities analyst <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Skislock </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Rotan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>'s aim is to control <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION>'s 56,400 acres of Hawaiian real estate and <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout offer is an attempt to prevent such a move.

 Stock market crashes similar to last October's could happen again even if market procedures are changed, say the top-level federal officials who produced a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> study of the nation's financial markets The officials told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee Thursday that their proposals for changing some market procedures could do little about external factors that influence investors. Their report is being criticized by lawmakers for its lack of significant recommendations. `` We can not provide an ironclad guarantee that there will not be another Oct. 19 in our future,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, one of the report's authors. `` Unforeseen economic forces could, on their own, conceivably trigger such an event.'' The White House report, released Monday, focused on the record 508-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of last Oct. 19, and the unusually large price swings that have occurred repeatedly ever since. The report was written by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. The officials recommended instituting a `` circuit breaker'' that would temporarily halt trading on the nation's stock, futures and options exchanges in case the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 250 points in a single day. That has happened only once, last Oct. 19. The report also urged that improvements be made in the credit, clearing and settlement procedures the markets use to complete transactions. But the working group suggested no limitations on computerized program trading, some forms of which have been blamed for adding to market volatility. It also failed to agree on whether to change the margins, or up-front payments, required for futures transactions. Margin requirements are lower on futures exchanges than for stock markets, which critics say causes speculation. The group ignored as well a recommendation made by an earlier <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel headed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, an investment banker, that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> or some other agency oversee issues that affect all markets. The working group's members have cautioned that it would be unrealistic to take steps such as curbing program trading. `` We can not go back to the days of the abacus or mechanical adding machines,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. Lawmakers, however, accused the report of not going far enough to ease volatility and soothe worried investors. `` It is you and your panel who continue to embrace anachronistic regulatory reforms that have been outstripped by new technologies,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. Further criticism came from Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, of which the finance subcommittee is a part He accused the working group of having `` given birth to a mouse'' and of failing to take steps to restore investors' confidence. `` You should not come by my office when people start buying rope and heating pots of tar and collecting feathers to apply to persons ... who have sat idly by ... while the financial situation of this nation erodes,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. The subcommittee has been holding hearings on the market's problems for months, but so far has written no legislation Asked outside the hearing room when a bill would emerge, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said, `` As soon as circumstances permit.''

Workers will return starting with the graveyard shift Sunday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Production work will resume Monday, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougher </PERSON>, vice president of Sunshine's local operations. Both sides refused to release details on the settlement until union members could review it. Workers at the Sunshine Mine downed tools and walked out at midnight May 10 after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer. Medical coverage, pay, job classifications and production incentives were among the unresolved issues. The mine reopened last November after an 18-month shutdown due to depressed silver prices. Union members agreed to return under company-imposed terms while negotiations continued, then struck when the talks broke down. Negotiations resumed Tuesday, ran well into the night Wednesday and returned Thursday afternoon.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate rose to a faster-than-expected 3.9 percent in April from 3.5 percent in the previous month, the government said Friday. Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in April from March, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> said. The index rose 0.4 percent in March from the previous month. The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 105.8 in April, 104.1 in March, and 101.8 in April 1987. Annual increases in local property taxes and rents and water charges accounted for nearly half of the monthly rise in the index, the department said. The department added that most of higher duties on alcohol, tobacco and gas outlined in the budget for the current fiscal year, which began in April, were reflected in prices for that month. Market forecasts had called for April's index to post an increase of between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent from March, and an increase of 3.5 percent to 3.8 percent from April 1987.

The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made its request Thursday, following a finding by an administrative judge that <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>, then called <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, violated federal health and safety regulations overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Ocupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> is appealing <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> citations and the administrative finding to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. While it does, the company faces the prospect that it and individual employees could be found in criminal violation of federal safety regulations. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has the right to seek criminal prosecution for such violations, but rarely has done so during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> found that <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> violations included inadequate inspections for cracks in a pressure tank that exploded, as well as poor training for its fire brigade. In addition to the 17 killed, the July 23, 1984 explosion injured 21 others. After reviewing government and company claims, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> administrative Judge R.M. Child concluded that the company `` failed to adequately inspect for the presence of cracks in pressure vessels, which exposed employees to increased likelihood of fire or explosion.'' Child also found that the company failed to use inspection techniques to determine the presence or absence of cracks and that `` this was a willful failure.'' He said the company `` willfully failed to provide fire-protective clothing to persons required to handle fires'' and `` willfully failed to provide adequate firefighting and education to its shift fire brigade.'' Child rejected one alleged violation and reduced the original fine levied against <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> to $ 22,000 from $ 31,000.

 A new all-natural orange juice has been introduced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to challenge <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s domination of the estimated $ 1.6 billion ready-to-serve orange juice industry. The Minute Maid Premium Choice, which contains no additives, marks Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>'s entry into the not-from-concentrate orange juice market, which surpassed frozen juice in sales in 1986. Vice President of Marketing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would not comment on when the product may be sold in other sections of the country.

 Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, only marginally better than March's 0.5 percent gain, the government reported today. More than one-fourth of the April rise came from a steep 2.0 percent jump in clothing costs, tying March for the greatest one-month gain since price records were first kept in 1947. Grocery prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months, while energy prices were up sharply as well _ reflecting the steepest rise in gasoline prices since August. The April gain meant that for the first four months of 1988 retail prices were up at an annual rate of 4.5 percent. While this was little changed from the 4.4 percent for all of 1987, economists were concerned because much of the inflationary pressure has shown up in the last two months. Analysts noted that the March rise had been the most severe since January 1987. On Thursday, investors set aside worries about inflation long enough to help the stock and bond markets break their recent slides. A number of senators, meanwhile, have reaffirmed the government's pledge to stand behind deposits in the nation's savings and loan institutions after a congressional agency reported the doubling of the deficit in the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L insurance fund `` There is absolutely no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stands behind our deposit insurance program,'' <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., said at a hearing Thursday by his panel On Wall Street, stock prices staged a partial recovery Thursday that traders attributed to `` bargain shopping'' and lessening of recent tension over inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell a total of 56.54 points Tuesday and Wednesday, rose 7.63 to 1,958.72. Broader market gauges were mixed. Bond prices advanced after falling in the first three sessions this week. The price of the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose nearly $ 2.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value as its yield slipped to 9.27 percent from 9.29 percent late Wednesday. In the report on thrifts, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of the accounting and financial management division of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said the liabilities of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> exceeded its assets by $ 13.7 billion at the end of 1987, up from $ 6.3 billion a year earlier. He also said the money available to the insurance fund _ $ 28 billion over the next 10 years _ `` probably will not be adequate'' to restore the industry's health by closing or merging 505 institutions listed as insolvent. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> estimated it would cost $ 30 billion to $ 35 billion to clean up the S & amp; L mess, which is centered primarily in Southwestern states hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets. That estimate does not include an additional 435 `` barely solvent'' institutions, he said. In other economic developments Thursday: _ The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in early May while a narrower measure fell, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported _ The nation's 24 largest investor-owned utilities charged their commercial and industrial electric users an average 6.28 cents per kilowatt-hour over the 12 months ended April 30, down from 6.29 cents a year earlier, a study by the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said _ Assets of the nation's 425 money market mutual funds rose $ 3.70 billion to $ 274.12 billion in the latest week, more than offsetting a $ 3.35 billion drop the previous week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said

 The stock market advanced in moderate trading early today, extending Thursday's rebound, as Wall Street drew some reassurance from the latest news on inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 5.80 points at 1,964.52 at 10 a.m. EDT on Wall Street. Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 2-to-1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 639 issues advancing, 278 declining and 452 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 20.6 million shares in the first half-hour of trading. The government reported today that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, a level that had been widely anticipated by economists and traders. The retail inflation report `` really was right on the money,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the head of block trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everyone felt much better ... People seem to be more willing to bid for stocks today.'' The stock and bond markets have been haunted this week by fears that inflation could be rekindled, and the anxiety pushed the Dow average down a total of 56.54 points on Tuesday and Wednesday. If the April rise in consumer prices had been more than the expected 0.4 percent, many analysts said, stocks and bonds would likely have taken another sharp hit today. Despite today's reprieve, though, analysts said concern about inflationary pressures continues to hang over the market. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all listed issues was up 0.40 at 143.41. On the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index rose 0.38 to 292.17. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 7.63 to close at 1,958.72 after dropping 25 points in early trading. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 843 down, 640 up and 496 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 165.16 million shares, down from 209.42 million shares in the previous session.

 Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April as clothing costs gained for the second straight month and grocery prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months, the government said today. Energy prices were up sharply as well, reflecting the steepest rise in gasoline prices since August. The overall gain, only marginally better than March's 0.5 percent gain, meant that for the first four months of 1988 retail prices were up at an annual rate of 4.5 percent. While this was little changed from the 4.4 percent for all of 1987, economists were concerned because much of the inflationary pressure has shown up in the last two months. Analysts noted that the March rise had been the most severe since January 1987. Last month's 0.4 percent overall gain was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 5.3 percent. `` The general message in this report is that prices have been rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will continue to do so,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fears that people have had about higher inflation are justified.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said that the underlying inflation rate is now somewhere around 5 percent, about 1 percentage point higher than it has been for the last year. The stock market, which had fallen sharply on Tuesday and Wednesday because of worries about inflation and interest rates, took today's report in stride, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average edging up slightly in early trading. Analysts said the overall gain did not prompt a new sell-off because the report was in line with expectations. But they cautioned that financial markets remain edgy about the building inflationary pressures. More than one-fourth of the April gain in consumer prices came from a steep 2.0 percent jump in clothing costs, tying March for the greatest one-month gain since price records were first kept in 1947. As was the case with March, analysts said the more expensive clothing was chiefly the result of higher priced women's clothing lines. Grocery store prices rose 0.8 percent in April, the biggest advance since August 1986. Leading the way were sharply higher prices for beef -LRB- up 2.3 percent -RRB-, fish -LRB- up 2.9 percent -RRB-, and fruits and vegetables -LRB- up 1.4 percent -RRB-. Gasoline prices climbed 1.1 percent last month after a 0.4 percent March rise. Last month's jump was the steepest since a 3.3 percent rise in August. After that, gasoline prices had fallen for six straight months. The gasoline price increases over the last two months largely reflected concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would agree with non-member nations to limit production. But those talks ended in failure and world oil prices have since fallen substantially, leading analysts to believe that retail prices will soon turn downward. The department gave these other specifics on April retail price activity: _ The record gain in clothing costs reflected an average 3.5 percent gain in the prices of women's apparel, a 2.7 percent rise in the prices for children's goods and a 2.1 percent jump in men's clothing _ New car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costs fell by 1.1 percent _ Public transportation expenses, reflecting a jump in airline fares, rose 0.8 percent _ Home heating oil prices rose 0.9 percent, while natural gas and electricity costs rose 0.4 percent The April increase left the overall index at 117.1, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 during a 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 117.10 last month. Unlike the other figures in the report, the overall index is not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. Fears of inflation have stirred up financial markets in recent days and economists. Stocks barely broke a two-day losing streak Thursday after worries about inflation and rising interest rates pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average down sharply Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors have viewed with some alarm a string of seemingly good economic reports in recent weeks. Unemployment in April fell to a 14-year-low of 5.4 percent while the factory operating rate climbed to an eight-year-high of 82.7 percent. While evidence of better-than-expected economic activity, the reports also raised fears in financial markets that the economy is growing too strongly and soon tight labor markets and high factory operating rates will translate into higher wages and rising prices. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration maintained that the concerns about inflation have been overblown. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that the administration saw no reason to change its forecast that consumer prices would rise by 4.3 percent this year. In 1987, consumer prices climbed 4.4 percent. Private economists are in general agreement with the administration's forecast, contending that the inflation worries exhibited by the market would subside once the impact of a spike in oil prices abates. `` The markets discovered inflation and now they are overdoing it,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, director of the economic forecasting project at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Inflation is going to rise, but I do n't see it going above 5 percent even next year.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he was not looking for inflation to get above 4.5 percent this year because of the actions already taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Twice in the past two months, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tightened up on credit conditions and pushed interest rates higher in an effort to dampen economic demand. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tightened and it will tighten more and that will keep inflation in check,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> predicted.

Meanwhile, a walkout by 4,700 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> union workers in six states continues for a sixth day with no contract talks planned. <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, voted in favor of the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> contract on Thursday and workers in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, approved it today, said <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with soybeans slightly higher, wheat slightly lower and corn prices mixed. The higher soybean opening surprised many traders who had expected a continution of Thursday's late sell-off and quieter activity after the exchange increased margins overnight for the second time this week. The price to play the grain futures market has more than doubled since Monday, with initial margins on soybeans now $ 2,000 compared to $ 900 on Friday. For that reason, traders expected small speculators to shy away from the soybean market this morning. Many of the weaker players did take profits on Thursday. But with forecasts calling for continued dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, speculators were still betting that grain and soybean prices will go higher, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There is still very strong support here for the grains,'' he said. `` The market did start steady to easier, but then everybody wanted to buy it.'' In early trading, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.40 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with July at $ 2.18 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with July at $ 1.71 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.69 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with June at 73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .30 cent higher with May at 80.75 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .28 cent higher with June at 53.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .60 cent higher with May at 53.20 cents a pound.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> today urged the family that controls <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to consider splitting the company into two or more publishing and broadcast firms. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who is engaged in a takeover bid for Richmond-based Media General, said at the annual stockholders meeting that his interest `` is not in taking the newspapers away'' from company Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and his family. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and two associates were submitted as candidates for election to the company's board of dierectors. Stockholders will vote on board members today, but the results will not be announced until later, after all proxies have been counted. One item not on the agenda for the meeting was <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s buyout offer. Media General officials rejected <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s original $ 61.50-per-share offer to buy all the company's stock. That offer was made Feb. 29, and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> has since sweetened his bid to $ 70 a share. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and his associates own 10.1 percent of Media General Class A stock, an investment of more than $ 111 million. Members of the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family own 70 percent of the company's Class B stock, which controls seven of the 10 board seats The <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family also owns about 12 percent of the publicly traded Class A stock. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is seeking to have himself, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON> named Class A directors. Media General has recommended that its three directors be re-elected. The days leading up to the annual meeting were marked by charges and countercharges between the two parties. On Saturday, lawyers for Media General and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> aired their allegations of unfair tactics in the proxy battle before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Both sides had filed motions for injunctions to stop the opposition from delivering what they characterized as false and misleading information to shareholders. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied both sides' motions, calling adversaries in proxy fights `` the world's most thin-skinned people'' and saying he found no evidence of irreparable harm by either party. The judge also said the proper time for the parties to assess damages was after the annual meeting. Earlier this week, Media General officials said <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> had offered to end his attempt to land three board seats in exchange for control of the company's cable television franchises in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> strongly denied ever making such an offer, and called Media General's claim `` a desperate move to make it appear as though we are losing the proxy contest. In my opinion, this last-minute trick just wo n't work.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices slipped in light dealings this morning as inflation worries continued to weigh on the market despite a new government report that consumer prices rose only modestly in April. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond edged down -LRB- point, or about $ 1.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value, by midday as its yield rose to 9.29 percent from 9.27 percent late Thursday. As trading got underway today, the government said consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, compared with a 0.5 percent rise in March. While low inflation is usually seen as good news for bond investors, the report failed to inspire any buying in today's market That was partly because the size of the increase had been widely expected, and partly because investors remain fearful that the economy is growing so quickly that inflation may eventually accelerate, analysts said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money market research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the reaction `` is the hallmark of a bear market.'' `` There is some good news in the April statistics that should allay concerns that inflation is accelerating, and the market ignores that. It gravitates to bad news,'' he said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments slipped 1-32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3-32 point and 20-year issues were off 9-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was off 0.07 at 108.68. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.95 to 1,137.11. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.02 at 274.66. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose 10 basis points to 6.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose 5 basis points to 6.60 percent and one-year bills rose 4 basis points at 6.95 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 7 -LRB- percent, up from 6 15-16 percent late Thursday.

 Stock prices were mixed this morning in quiet trading, which brokers described as a brief pause following the market's declines earlier this week over fears of higher inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 1.16 points to 1,959.88 as of noon EDT. Broader market indices were mixed. Gaining issues narrowly led declines on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 652 up, 527 down and 583 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 54.36 million shares in the morning, vs. 78.35 million Thursday morning. The government reported today that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April. Although that level was widely anticipated by economists and traders, it substantiated some anxiety about inflation that has been haunting the market. As with other recent sessions, <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume was partly inflated by trading strategies aimed at capturing dividends of selected stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s most active issue was a dividend trade, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> at 17 ~, unchanged More than 4 million shares were traded.

<HEAD>SmithKline and Nova Pharmaceutical to Market Drugs Jointly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to develop and market a variety of painkilling and central nervous system drugs, pending approval from both firm's boards, Baltimore-based Nova announced. The preliminary agreement, estimated to be worth $ 72.5 million to <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION>, eventually will give Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> an estimated 20 percent stake in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION>, which was founded in 1982. The two firms would be advancing work on a range of drugs Nova has developed, including a class of painkillers targeted at bradykinin, which <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> report plays a key role in relaying pain messages to the nervous system. The findings were reported in the current issue of the Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is quite significant for Nova,'' <PERSON> Arda </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minocherhomjee </PERSON>, a health-care analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Howse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Ragen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said of the joint venture. `` It gives them access to an excellent marketing partner, and, furthermore, it gives them the capital needed to develop their products.'' After the agreement was announced Thursday, <PERSON> Nova </PERSON>'s stock closed unchanged in over-the-counter trading at $ 8.25 a share. `` Nova cut a very attractive deal as far as they're concerned,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartash </PERSON>, pharmaceutical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's very good, and they get <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> to carry some of the development costs.'' `` You need to raise the funds when you do n't need them,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, president and chief executive of Nova, which analysts estimate had $ 2.4 million in cash and more than $ 15 million in available funds as of March 31, more than enough to finance its research and development expenses this year. For the first quarter ended March 31, the company lost $ 1.4 million, compared with a loss of $ 2 million a year ago. Revenues increased to $ 4.1 million from $ 1.6 million. Nova received <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval in January to start clinical testing on an analgesic that blocks the transmission of bradykinins, a powerful pain-producing substance in the body. The company is conducting clinical trials on a nasal spray form of the drug to block symptoms of the common cold and plans to seek <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval to test the drug's effectiveness in relieving inflammation and blocking burn pain. Analysts estimate that the potential annual market for the analgesic could easily top $ 100 million three or four years after it is released. <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> also is developing compounds to treat central nervous system disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. Under the terms of the agreement, <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> would form separate partnerships to develop and market the painkillers and the central nervous system products. As part of the latter agreement, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> would make an immediate cash payment of $ 25 million to <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> in return for 2.7 million newly issued common shares and warrants to purchase 775,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> at $ 9.28 a share. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> has also agreed to purchase by December 1991 $ 24 million worth of Nova common stock and warrants to purchase an undisclosed number of shares at 15 percent above market price at the time of the purchase. The partnership, which is to be 60 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>, would receive the right to license SmithKline's psychiatric drugs, including Thorazine and Stelazine _ which currently account for about $ 40 million in annual revenues _ once the first central nervous system product was marketed. The analgesics partnership calls for <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> to pay an initial $ 1 million and assume $ 21.5 million of debt primarily to commercialize the painkiller. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> would manufacture it and obtain exclusive worldwide marketing rights, while <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> would retain a 50 percent share of control over that partnership and half the profits obtained from product sales. `` We fully expect to take a leadership role in the evolving field of neurobiology,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. `` Nova's exciting research projects, together with our drug development and marketing capability, makes a powerful combination.''

<HEAD>British Rail Reportedly Under Study For Privatization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government is considering selling off British Rail, the national railroad system, the Economist magazine reported in its latest issue. The plan is being worked on by a policy unit within Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office, the magazine said in its May 21 issue, which was made available Friday. Spokesmen for the prime minister, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they were unaware of any plans for the privatization of the railway. A report in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the prime minister's office confirmed that a study of the state company's privatization is in progress but stressed that it was at an early stage The Economist said three options are being explored. The first is selling the entire network as a going concern. But that would be made difficult by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s current troubled financial state, which requires government subsidies for operation. A second option calls for splitting <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> into regional companies. The magazine said this option is under study by <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, a special adviser in the prime minister's policy unit. <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> declined to answer questions about the reports. The third option would be to form a `` track authority'' which would put operation of British Rail's track and signaling hardware up for private bidding, the magazine said. The Economist said plans for a split-up of British Rail into regional companies are also being studied by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a private think tank, which will publish its conclusions next month. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has sold off billions of pounds worth of state assets, including <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the phone company, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, since she came into power in 1979. It currently is in the process of preparing the sale of the electicity industry of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed higher, but below their best levels Friday as an uncertain start to business on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> reduced <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading volume to a trickle. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 9.6 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,770.2. Volume came to 493 million shares compard with 442.3 million shares on Thursday. Equities continued to closely track performances in overseas stock markets. Gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday and in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier Friday, pushed up the 100-share index more than 14 points in late morning. But shares drifted back Friday afternoon as Wall Street surrendered early gains and moved back into negative territory. By the end of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was barely changed on the day. Dealers said institutional activity was light, with selling interest roughly offsetting purchases. `` U.K. institutions really are n't showing direction,'' one dealer said. The market shrugged off news that British retail prices rose a greater-than-expected 1.6 percent in April. Dealers said the inflation figures are frequently distorted by seasonal factors in April, the first month of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fiscal year. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> players kept a closer eye on the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation figures, but they were in line with many economists' forecasts and ended up having little effect on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index gained 0.4 percent in April, compared with an 0.5-percent increase in March. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 7.1 points at 1,415.2 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 5.77 points to close at 1,000.80.

 Twenty years after <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> announced it would build it own atomic reactor, the ill-fated <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> project has become a symbol for the problems that extinguished many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s grandest hopes for nuclear power. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is the first major public power company to seek refuge from its creditors in bankruptcy court, and there remains no assurance that <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, its pricetag now at $ 5.4 billion and rising $ 50 million a month, ever will clear evacuation-planning hurdles and generate electricity. Spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> conceded this week that, with the benefit of hindsight, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would have followed a different course if the decision to build were being made again. `` But that's irrelevant,'' <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. `` The bigger question is, how can we have a regulatory system that after 20 years can not make a decision on a major power project?'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> narrowly averted bankruptcy in 1984, completing a $ 425 million bond sale that was the largest financing in utility industry history. But nuclear disasters _ first at <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Three Mile Island in 1979 and then at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986 _ dealt <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> a devastating blow <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, now the likely 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, cited Chernobyl when he decided to oppose evacuation planning for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities near <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has since become a key obstacle, though <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s evacuation plans also still lack final approval. The environment surrounding nuclear power in May 1968 and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s early experiences with it gave little clue of the troubles that lay ahead. A byproduct of research that produced the atomic bomb during World War II, nuclear power in the 1940s and 1950s was seen by many as `` the key to the world's future,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> wrote in his 1983 report `` Nuclear Power: The Market Test.'' `` It would supply infinite amounts of energy indefinitely and remove many of the constraints under which humanity had struggled for millennia,'' <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON> wrote. Another early claim by nuclear proponents was that it would provide energy too cheap to meter. Energy from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s first nuclear plant, <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rowe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was n't too cheap to meter. But it was only pennies per kilowatt-hour, cheaper than other alternatives at the time. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> owned 7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION>, which cost $ 44 million to build and began operation in 1960 as one of a half-dozen prototype reactors nationwide funded by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. By 1968, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also had investments in other nuclear plants operating or under construction _ <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>. After conducting studies that projected continued strong growth in energy demand, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decided to join dozens of other utilities that were jumping on the nuclear bandwagon. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s largest power company announced on May 20, 1968, that it would build an 860-megawatt reactor on the <LOCATION> Piscataqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was to own 50 percent of the plant, with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> to pick up most of the rest of the tab. The plant was to cost $ 150 million and be operating commercially by the fall of 1974, company Chairman <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> announced. But the federal government squelched the original plan, saying the <LOCATION> Newington </LOCATION> location was too close to <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chose an alternate site on marshland at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> shelved the plans in 1969 after problems arose in financing the plant. Later, utility studies showed a need for a big new power plant, and the company revived its nuclear plans on Feb. 1, 1972. The plans were subsequently revised to include two 1,150-megawatt reactors, the first to be operating commercially in 1979, the second in 1981. The total cost was estimated at $ 850 million. Although the oil crisis of 1973 heightened awareness about energy, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> began running into problems that earlier nuclear plants had not faced. <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> drew a comparison between <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wiscasset </LOCATION>, an 826-megawatt reactor that began operating in 1972 at a construction cost of $ 239 million. `` They went through their environmental -LRB- impact -RRB- hearings in an afternoon,'' <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. `` It took <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> several years.'' Controversy over <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s cooling-water system was n't finally settled until August 1978, causing years of delays and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the plant's cost. By then, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> also had become the target of highly visible opposition. Civil disobedience actions began at the plant site in 1976, months before groundbreaking, and a May 1977 protest that ended with 1,414 arrests _ the largest at any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plant at that time _ made <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> the focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Quiet European Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AMs version expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in lackluster European trading Friday. Gold prices fell. Dealers said trading was extremely thin and quiet, partly because many traders on the Continent went home early before a three-day weekend. `` You could hear a pin drop in the trading room today,'' said one dealer at a British merchant bank. The dollar's slight gains were due to a flurry of buying in the morning after <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, reiterated that his country was at war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and called for an arms buildup. The dollar jumped up on the report. But then it barely moved for several hours until it edged back late in the day, dealers said. One dealer said market players did not take the report seriously but that it gave them something to do. The dollar was not affected by news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in April because the rise was in line with expectations, dealers said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. The pound fell to $ 1.8615 from $ 1.8665 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose fractionally to a closing 124.82 yen from 124.80 yen late Thursday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.85 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.7030 West German marks, up from 1.6990; 1.4195 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155; 5.7560 French francs, up from 5.7542; 1.9070 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9042; 1,263.50 Italian lire, up from 1,262.00; and 1.2420 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2442. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 45 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 458.01 an ounce. Later gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 455.20 a troy ounce from late Thursday's $ 456.90. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 455.50 a troy ounce compared with $ 458.00 late Thursday. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.64 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 6.72 an ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which broke off takeover talks with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, said it still may launch a tender offer for the food giant, government documents show. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it may `` seek control of the company through negotiations with the board of directors and management, through a tender offer,'' or through the purchase of additional shares of Multifoods stock. But the filing, which contained a laundry list of alternatives, also stated the group may simply opt to sell its Multifoods holdings. Last December <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> Partners disclosed in an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it held 10.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding common stock. Earlier, it had sought federal government clearance to raise its stake to as high as 25 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said in its Thursday filing that it has `` contacted several third parties regarding their possible interest in providing financing'' for a takeover of Multifoods. The Canadian group also said it has contacted a number third parties that may be interested in buying certain Multifoods business units. <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which consists mainly of the <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> banking family of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, said last year it might seek control of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multifoods </ORGANIZATION>, an international food manufacturer and distributor. The Minneapolis-based company said Thursday it had received a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> ending the Canadian group's consideration of an acquisition and thus terminating a standstill agreement between the two concerns <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> had agreed not to purchase additional International Multifoods shares while negotiations were under way. The company has said it would oppose any takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Bregman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, and in October filed suit alleging that the partnership had illegally caused speculation in its stock and filed misleading government disclosure statements.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 95 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Facet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock has been tendered into its $ 32-a-share cash offer for the filter maker. The $ 250 million offer expired at 11 p.m. Thursday, and more than 5.7 million Facet shares were tendered by the deadline, the oil giant said. Tulsa-based Facet sought <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> as a `` white knight'' to help fight off hostile bidder <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Facet board rejected a $ 27.50-a-share offer from Prospect and instituted anti-takeover provisions. Prospect dropped its $ 199 million bid shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> came on the scene. Facet is Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s first acquisition since it received $ 3 billion in cash from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as settlement in their four-year legal dispute over control of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> officials have said, however, that the Facet purchase is not part of their strategy for using that money <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> officials will meet next month to discuss further acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, Facet's largest customer, has said it will operate the company from its current headquarters as a separate entity. As part of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> reportedly will assume $ 50 million in Facet debt, which resulted mostly from its $ 67 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year. Facet President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said the company would be in a better position to accelerate its expansion plans under <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> control. Facet is considering acquisitions _ in the aviation and auto filter businesses as well as in the medical and food filtration businesses _ to help boost its annual revenue from the current $ 350 million to $ 1 billion by 1990, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Friday it is laying off 1,200 employees as a result of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s purchase by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, a Cincinnati-based department store group, said 600 employees will lose their jobs in the company's central organization and the remaining 600 will be laid off from the 43 stores and regional organization. <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> has 15,000 employees and operates in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. All of the employees will know their status by June 11, company officials said. Those laid off will be given severance money and benefits and will be offered help finding jobs elsewhere, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> said in a statement. The layoffs are part of a `` streamlining plan'' developed by the <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> management team, the company said. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, public relations spokeswoman for <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, said she could not discuss details of the severance packages for those being laid off. Asked whether there will be further layoffs, Ms. <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> said, `` I have no way of telling that, but this is all that's been given to us.'' `` The reduction of approximately 1,200 associates is due to the uncertain retail environment that the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> has experienced since last October, to streamline structural problems resulting from two mergers and an acquisition, and the need to service the financial cost of the purchase of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> said in its statement. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Canadian businessman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, recently won the right to buy the Cincinnati-based Federated for $ 6.6 billion, ending a takeover battle begun Jan. 25. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based development company, bought <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates more than 650 stores nationwide and had 1987 sales of $ 11 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has said its costs of the Federated purchase, including borrowing money for the deal, will be more than $ 8 billion. Prior to the takeover battle, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> had consolidated its retail operations in 1986 and 1987 by merging eight of its store groups, including <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, into three retail units.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> faces a difficult challenge in attempting to defeat BAT Industries' $ 4.5 billion takeover bid, the insurer's chairman said Friday. The $ 63-a-share offer is `` perhaps the test of Farmers' mettle,'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Farmers' chairman, told about 500 people attending the company's annual meeting here The offer by BAT and its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has been vigorously opposed by management at Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and auto insurance company and the seventh-largest property and casualty insurer <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> warned shareholders against becoming confused by the offer. `` Farmers' record is unparalleled. We are supremely confident we can continue to enhance shareholder value in the future,'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said. Results of a non-binding shareholder resolution proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which urged Farmers' board to negotiate, will not be available for at least a week, <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said. Also addressing Farmers' shareholders was BAT's chairman, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>. He agreed with <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON>'s upbeat forecast for Farmers and reiterated earlier statements that BAT would pay substantially more than $ 63 a share if Farmers would only negotiate. `` We want to buy Farmers because it's a first-class organization that has excellent growth prospects,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` We are pleased with the support that we received from <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on our resolution recommending the Farmers' directors reconsider their refusal to negotiate with us,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said `` We look forward to receiving the actual tally.'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified company whose better-known interests include <ORGANIZATION> Kool </ORGANIZATION> cigarettes and <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> stores, said Thursday about 18 percent of the company's shareholders had offered to sell their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> at the offered price of $ 63 a share. The outcome of the proxy vote may not be known for some days, because anything other than an obviously overwhelming vote one way or the other will have to be independently verified, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulwell </PERSON>, Farmers vice president and treasurer. The battle for control of the company has been spirited, with Farmers criticizing BAT for doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and suggesting its tobacco holdings make it unfit to control an insurance company that gives non-smoker discounts. Louisville-based <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, for its part, has responded by pointing out that Farmers has invested $ 200 million of the money collected from policy holders in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> has committed to maintaining non-smoker discounts, and points out that British insurers owned by <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> have instituted non-smoking rates since BAT acquired them. BAT does less than 1 percent of its business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and subscribes to Common Market guidelines for such businesses aimed at bettering the lot of blacks under apartheid, spokesmen have said. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of <LOCATION> Kool </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Viceroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> and Belair cigarettes, and retailers including <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s.

 Grain and soybean futures closed higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with soybeans up sharply on fears of continued dry weather. Weekend weather forecasts were mixed, but even the most optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only slight moisture to parts of the Corn Belt, analysts said. With soybean stockpiles declining, a poor crop this year could lead to tight supplies next year. `` My weatherman is the market and the market says we're not going to get much rain this weekend, so that's what I'm going by,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But if more rain should fall than expected this weekend, grain and soybean prices probably would plummet on Monday, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` It's a very nervous market,'' he said. At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.46 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.21 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with July at $ 1.73 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 12 cents higher with July at $ 7.80

 Stock prices closed mostly lower today in some of the lightest trading this year, capping a loss-riddled week in which apathy and tension over higher interest rates dominated the market. `` It's just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the public,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, head of equity trading at the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Although the market showed little reaction to a government report that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, the figure helped substantiate existing fear that higher inflation is inevitable. Since inflation means higher interest rates, yields in the bond market rose and became an increasingly attractive alternative to stocks, driving prices lower. MORE

<HEAD>Pilots Say Eastern to Cut Back Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will cut back its operations by nearly 20 percent starting this summer, its pilots union says. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials told union representatives of the plans at an April 29 meeting during discussion of pilots' scheduling, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the 20 percent `` is a speculative figure.'' `` That's from <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` We have n't determined or finalized our flying plans beyond July.'' But Eastern, a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in its most recent quarterly report to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that more cutbacks and losses are imminent. `` In anticipation of continuing losses, Eastern is considering and anticipating a further downsizing of the operations,'' said the report made public this week. Eastern sustained a net loss of $ 30.9 million in the first quarter. The union representing some 3,500 Eastern pilots said they were told by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> that the planned flight reductions stem from a worsening pilot shortage, a huge backlog of pilot vacations postponed by the company to keep planes flying and a `` training logjam'' on A300 and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 jetliners. According to union calculations, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would operate 56,812 block hours this September, down sharply from 78,236 this month. A block hour measures how long it takes a plane to taxi and fly from one airport to another. Flight levels have not been that low since 1968, the pilots said. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said, though, there was no indication that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would lay off more workers to adjust for the cutbacks. The union also said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> estimates it has lost 1,037 pilots since July 1986. A total of 392 will have been hired, for a net reduction of 645. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the carrier has enough pilots to meet its planned schedules. Employment at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been slashed from 40,000 to around 32,000 workers since <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal judge said Friday that he would rule after the financial markets close Monday on <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to block a $ 182 million hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said he would review the case over the weekend before ruling on <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction against the Swedish appliance manufacturer. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> produces lawn mowers and bicycles. A five-day hearing had focused on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cromwell </ORGANIZATION>, which represented <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> in its $ 48-a-share offer made May 6. But the firm also offered advice in 1987 to <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on strategy for fighting takeovers, testimony showed. In closing arguments, <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> contended that the huge <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> benefited from inside information provided by <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the law firm was privy to sensitive information about <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, including financial projections and takeover tactics. He said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cromwell </ORGANIZATION> partner advising <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> on the takeover, knew that his firm had confidential information about <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> in its files, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> then told <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> vice president, of the existence of the information and then advised the Swedish company on what price to offer for <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> -RRB- was being told how to bet by one who knew,'' he said. But <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> said his clients were `` innocent bystanders.'' He said that no witness, including those from <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, testified about any specific insider information being given to <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, he said thousands of pages of files produced for the hearing offered no evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> ever used confidential information to analyze <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for the takeover. The analysis was based on public sources, he said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> had any inside information ... you would think some of it would be documented somewhere,'' he said.

 Income tax payments in April helped shrink the federal budget deficit, but the monthly surplus was less than a year ago, leaving government red ink so far this year 24.6 percent higher than 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The April surplus of $ 13.9 billion, representing the difference between what the government took in and what it spent last month, helped hold the deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal year to $ 105.0 billion. But that figure was much higher than the $ 84.3 billion in red ink during the first seven months of fiscal year 1987, when the total annual deficit eventually amounted to $ 150.2 billion. Economists say the April report indicates the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will have a tough time meeting its goal of a $ 146.7 billion deficit for fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, or even the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> projection of $ 157 billion. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of an economic forcasting service in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the April report indicates the deficit for the year will be between $ 170 billion and $ 175 billion. `` April's the big month. After that, it's all arithmetic. ... The belief that it was going to stay below $ 150 billion was just pure fiction,'' he said. The 1988 deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law is $ 144 billion. Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that an across-the-board cut in federal programs, which would occur in October under the law, was `` perilously close.'' The April surplus, bolstered by $ 53.3 billion in individual income tax payments, was about $ 5 billion less than expected by private economists. They had been waiting for the report to see what effect the new income tax law would have. Some had thought the new tax law would provide a small windfall. However, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the average, median taxpayer enjoyed a tax cut. `` People who used deductions and shelters paid more than they did the year before, but the rank and file paid less,'' he said. April income tax collections were 25.8 percent less than the same month a year earlier, which was inflated by the rush to take capital gains in 1986 before the favorable rates on that kind of income disappeared under the new tax law. Personal income tax collections of $ 237.6 billion for the first seven months of the fiscal year are running 2.7 percent behind last year. However, that has been offset somewhat by corporate income tax collections of $ 50.6 billion, 8.4 percent greater than last year. In April, all government revenue totaled $ 109.3 billion, 11.0 percent lower than April 1987. Spending totaled $ 95.4 billion, 13.6 percent ahead of the same month a year earlier. For the first seven months, revenues totaled $ 522.1 billion, up 3 percent over 1987, while spending was $ 627.1 billion, up 6.1 percent from the same period a year ago. As usual, the largest spending categories in April were the military, followed by Social Security, other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and interest on the national debt. Military spending totaled $ 26.1 billion last month and $ 168.4 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.3 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled $ 16.3 billion last month and $ 121.3 billion for the past seven months, up 5.7 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is exempted from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and most months has been showing faster spending increases than the other categories. The other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 15.7 billion in April and $ 93.2 billion so far this budget year, a 6.5 percent increase over 1987. Interest on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt totaled $ 14.9 billion last month and $ 120.1 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.5 percent over the same period last year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> selected four contractor teams Friday to develop a new type of high-speed, gallium arsenide computer chip. The three-year contracts, ranging in value from $ 49 million to about $ 69 million, call for each team to design, fabricate, package and test the same type of computer chip.

 Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> retirees marched outside <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders meeting Friday to protest changes in health-care benefits they say discriminate against salaried workers. `` We retirees all retired with what we thought was an implied, a moral and a legal contract that we would have our health insurance benefits for life,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON>, a retiree who lives in Grand Blanc. `` What right does <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> have to discriminate against salaried <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees?'' he said. Of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 309,000 retirees, about 84,000 were salaried workers. Hourly workers' pensions and other retirement benefits are negotiated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, which does not represent salaried workers. In July, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will change its health care plan for salaried workers _ both active and retired _ to encourage the use health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations over <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> health insurance by forcing users of the traditional plan to pay deductibles and half of each monthly premium. Single salaried workers will be required to pay $ 200 deductibles, families will pay $ 250, and both pay 20 percent of the next $ 2,500 in medical charges. Workers who opt for HMOs and PPOs pay no deductibles or premiums and only 30 percent of charges for each office visit, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s general director of employee benefits. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also moved vision and hearing care from separate plans that covered all costs into its optional comprehensive coverage, which has deductibles and premium cost-sharing, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> made similar changes in 1984. Only 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> salaried workers now participate in managed health care plans. None of the changes affects hourly workers. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the company made the changes to stem costs and halt abuses. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 2.9 billion on employee and retiree health care in 1987 and faces higher costs in the future as its work force ages and the number of active workers supporting each retiree shrinks. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> increased salaried pensions by $ 850 a year. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the increases will total $ 3,400 by 1990, while the changes in the health care plan could cost salaried workers and retirees $ 750 a year. `` We are No. 1 in benefits literally in the world by almost any measure,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said the retirees' anger `` would be an easy thing to fix ... next time it comes around, we do n't put the money in cash, we put it back in the benefits. But that means the people who do n't use the benefits are going to get hurt and the people who do use them, or abuse them, are going to be better off. That's what we tried to avoid.'' A typical <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> salaried employee who retired at age 65 in 1985 receives about $ 40,400 a year in pension benefits and Social Security payments, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> retirees earn more than 66 percent of active workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a news conference after the nearly five-hour meeting, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also told reporters <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 3 billion on buyer incentives in 1987, which helped improve <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicle market to 37.4 percent in first-quarter 1988 from 33.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he believes any savings from eliminating incentives would be overcome by resulting lost sales. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has n't decided whether it will need additional plant closings to shrink the company's production capacity to fit its market share, which is still well below the 45 percent <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> held several years ago.

 Stocks crawled to a mixed finish Friday in the lightest trading of the year, capping a loss-riddled week in which investor apathy and concern over higher interest rates dominated the market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks spent part of the day barely ahead but weakened by late afternoon and finished with a 6.13 point loss to 1,952.59, bringing its decline for the week to 37.95. Broader market indices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 120.6 million shares vs. 165.16 million the previous session. It was the most lethargic pace since a 111.58 million-share day Dec. 29. Without the inflating influence of dividend-capture trading in selected stocks, the volume would have been substantially lighter. `` It's just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the public,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, head of equity trading at the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The government reported that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April. Although that level was widely anticipated by economists and traders, it substantiated some anxiety about inflation that haunted the market all week. This concern pushed yields on the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond to the 9.34 percent Friday, the highest of the year, making bonds an increasingly attractive and less risky alternative to stocks. `` The market has said something loud and clear: I'm going to attach myself to the tail of the bond market,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shobin </PERSON>, a vice president and market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Shobin </PERSON> said he saw the potential for a stock rally, arguing that fears over inflation are highly exaggerated and that any further substantial rise in interest rates is unlikely. `` I think the market has very little vulnerability here,'' <PERSON> Shobin </PERSON> said. `` The level of fear is very high right now, but fear is very fashionable. The market rarely rewards what the Street considers fashionable.'' Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3-to-2 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 841 issues up, 605 down and 514 unchanged. Among the most prominent <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 ~ to 45 | on reports that the company was considering a restructuring plan that would reduce the 14.8 percent stake of its largest shareholder, takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> Other notable blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- to 50 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- to 80 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 to 109 -LCB-; <PERSON> Merck </PERSON>, down 1 -RRB- to 149; and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- to 18 | Interest-sensitive stocks such as banks and utilities were widely higher, suggesting that concern over higher interest rates may be peaking. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 26 |, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> rose -LRB- to 23 -RCB-, Manufacturers Hanover rose -RRB- to 26 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T rose -LRB- to 26 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 52 Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 142.40 million shares.

 Investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, apparently conceding that his $ 1.8 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has stalled, on Friday suggested splitting the communications firm into two or more parts. Speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> also played down the bitter proxy fight he has waged with Media General Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> over the election of directors to the company's board. `` The questions that I have are not based on personalities,'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said. `` It's time to get down to business ... Let's meet together. Let's talk together.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, whose family owns 71 percent of Media General's powerful Class B shares, presided at the meeting but did not respond to <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s offer to negotiate. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has said the family's stake in the company is not for sale. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who controls about 10 percent of the company's Class A shares, initially offered $ 61.50 a share, but later boosted his bid to $ 70 a share. Subsequently, he and two allies have challenged three directors seeking re-election to <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-member board. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> told the stockholders that his slate would be fair to the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION> and would seek to split the company's assets in a way that preserved the family's publishing concerns. `` My interest is not in taking the newspapers away'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION>, he said. In addition to the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and other daily and weekly newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> owns several television stations and cable television operations. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, meanwhile, received a lengthy ovation from the crowd of about 400 shareholders when he read his own name for re-election to the board. Because of delays in counting proxy votes, the tally on the election of directors will not be released until May 27. But Media General President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, said `` based on the proxies that we have received, we believe the incumbent ... directors have defeated <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and his dissident slate.'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, however, said after the two-hour meeting that he believed the vote was nearly even. `` I think you'll find I was not the only shareholder who voted for our slate,'' he said. But several shareholders said <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s proposal to split the company indicated some doubt about his chances. Still, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said his $ 70-per-share bid still stands. Media General closed Thursday at $ 42.62 -LCB- a share. `` Look at the disparity in those numbers,'' he said. The stock dropped $ 1.12 -LCB- a share Friday to close at $ 41.37 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> criticized the two-tier stock arrangement and said he was seeking congressional action to eliminate such structures. Last month a federal district court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s challenge to the system Like several media companies including the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> has two classes of stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few. While there are fewer Class B shares outstanding, those shares are more powerful than the Class A shares. Under Media General's arrangement, the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family controls the election of a majority of the board through its Class-B shares. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is chairman of the California-based <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which produces `` The Dating Game'' and other popular television game shows and the South Carolina-based <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a cement company.

<HEAD>Platinum Surges As Inflation Signals Strengthen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices jumped more than $ 11 a troy ounce Friday, leading other precious metals higher as key indicators reinforced ideas that inflation is worsening, analysts said. On other markets, most livestock and meat futures gained; the pork markets received some startling news about supplies; grains and soybeans advanced; energy futures were mixed; and stock index futures retreated. A combination of inflationary signals and indications of economic growth have made platinum the leader of the precious-metals complex because platinum is used as both an industrial metal and a hedge against inflation, analysts said. Friday's government report showing a 0.4 percent increase in consumer prices in April supported the metals rally on Friday. But the real boost came late in the day when a sudden surge in soybean and grain futures prices propelled the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s price index of 21 commodities up sharply With Friday's 1.31-point gain, the CRB index for May delivery ended the week at 246.11, up 6.81 points from the previous Friday's close on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> `` That's really a fantastic move,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, metals analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All these things _ commodity prices, strength of the economy _ they're all feeding into why the metals are beginning to move. Platinum settled $ 11.10 to $ 11.20 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in July at $ 568.60 a troy ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold was 50 cents to 70 cents higher with June at $ 458.70 a troy ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 7.9 cents higher with May at $ 6.69 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher in light, pre-weekend trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But a government cold-storage report released after the close prompted predictions that pork futures would open lower on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the number of hams in cold storage nearly doubled during April to 51.6 million pounds. That compares with 24 million pounds on April 1 and 11.3 million pounds on May 1, 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the total amount of pork in cold storage was up 82 percent from last year, including 102.5 million pounds of frozen pork bellies, the third-largest May 1 total ever, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analysts in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The large stocks of frozen pork wo n't have an immediate impact on futures prices but will begin exerting heavy price pressure in July, when demand for pork products typically outstrips the supply of fresh meat, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent higher with May at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at 53.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent lower to .37 cent higher with May at 53.25 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures closed higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with soybeans up sharply on fears of continued dry weather. Weekend weather forecasts were mixed, but even the most optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only slight moisture to parts of the Corn Belt, analysts said. With soybean stockpiles declining, a poor crop this year could lead to tight supplies next year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in a six-to-10 day outlook issued after the close, predicted warm temperatures and normal rainfall for most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the latter half of next week and the Memorial Day weekend. Wheat settled unchanged to 5 \ cents higher with July at $ 3.46 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.21 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.73 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 11 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.78 -RCB- a Energy futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the contract for June delivery of crude oil expired at $ 17.17 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude settled unchanged to 8 cents higher with July at $ 17.70 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent lower to .11 cent higher with June at 47.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .12 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 52.36 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .20 point lower at 252.70

<HEAD>Judge Grants Limited Extension in Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY MITMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday granted <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> at least four extra months to come up with a reorganization plan, and may grant another two months after that. After a seven-hour hearing, Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> said he doubted he would grant the utility the eight months it had requested. But he said the utility was entitled at least to a four-month extension because `` the first 120 days have been used for organization in a rather unique case. `` Realistically, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is only now in a position they would be in the first few weeks of a normal case,'' <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> said. Federal bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for protection from creditors. The exclusivity period for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ the state's largest electric utility and main owner of the stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant _ ends May 27. It had asked for an eight-month extension, citing the complexity and uniqueness of the case. <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> said he would consider lengthening the extension later if he was assured that parties involved in the reorganization had adequate access to information needed to develop and negotiate a plan. <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> said he either would grant a four-month extension with a hearing in September to consider more time, or would grant a six-month extension with a hearing in September to be certain that necessary information is being made available to all involved. Several lawyers representing other parties to the bankruptcy had proposed shorter extension periods. But <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> said he was not convinced that it yet was appropriate to open up the reorganization process to other proposals, although he noted that `` one way to make things move is to make them concrete, put them on the table.'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection because of financial problems stemming from its 36 percent share of the $ 5.4 billion Seabrook plant. It blames its woes largely on political opposition to <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> and a state law barring the company from charging customers for the plant until it operates commercially, which had forced the company to borrow heavily.

 <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has repurchased 15.2 million shares from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 23 each, or about $ 350 million. A statement from the companies said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has a one-time option to request additional payment for the shares over the next two years if <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> stock rises above $ 23 a share, with a ceiling of $ 28 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired its interest in <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> in 1975, was the largest shareholder in the metals, oil and gas company. Analysts said the move highlights <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in focusing on its basic oil businesses. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estra </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warbug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` What it really means is <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> is focusing its effort back to its basic businesses and its interest in diversification is diminished.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Born </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>, said the company will have to borrow to finance the repurchase, but he expected the funds to be repaid from the current year's cash flow. `` <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> has completed a number of major steps to improve its profitability and potential and is experiencing significant improvement in its operating results,'' Born said. `` This share purchase will not dilute the earnings of <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining shareholders. `` We are currently expecting <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>'s net income in 1988 to be in the order of $ 4 per share and with this purchase of shares, those expected earnings should increase to about $ 4.25 per share,'' he said. The repurchase represents <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s total holdings in <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>.

 Workers at four <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plants approved a contract settlement, among them a key 2,500-member local union in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> that had rejected an earlier contract proposal, a union spokesman said Friday. Voting by six union locals is scheduled through Monday on the tentative settlement reached by <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union shortly before a noon strike deadline last Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> represents 15,000 workers at 11 of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s 42 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants. Meanwhile, a walkout by 4,700 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> union workers in six states continued for a sixth day Friday. <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the union's president, <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, has asked negotiators to return to the bargaining table in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> on Saturday. The talks will be the first in a week. Firestone spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> confirmed that talks would resume. <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, voted in favor of the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> contract on Thursday and workers in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, approved it Friday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Workers in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, rejected the offer Thursday with 54 percent voting against the proposal, he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did not release vote totals. The approval by the Union City local could be a key to its ratification nationwide because of its size. Under URW bylaws, ratification must be made by a majority of the locals representing a majority of the membership. Firestone workers went on strike Sunday after union negotiators rejected <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s offer, saying it did n't match the first agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, which was intended to served as a pattern for Firestone. Firestone officials contended their latest offer was equal to the Goodyear pattern. The Akron-based <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> represents Firestone workers in <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, Akr.; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> and the union reached its first tentative settlement on April 21, but it was rejected a week later.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion in cash in a deal that would create one of the nation's biggest supermarket concerns, both companies announced Friday. At the same time, <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> said its board terminated an April 28 agreement to merge with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.35 billion in cash and stock. The three principals said they agreed to dismiss all pending litigation involving the four-month takeover battle. Lucky said it would pay <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> a $ 20 million fee plus expenses for breaking the pact. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, Lucky closed unchanged at $ 64.37 -LCB- Friday while <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1 to $ 53.25. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> said it has received written commitments from commercial banks for all financing required. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> offer expires at midnight EDT June 1. `` We are extremely pleased that an agreement has been reached,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.S. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>. `` American Stores has always considered Lucky to be the leading supermarket chain in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is enthusiastic about the combination of our <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- grocery store -RRB- operations with those of Lucky.'' Under the agreement, any Lucky shares not purchased by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive $ 65 in cash in a merger between Lucky and a subsidiary of American. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> had raised its bid for Lucky to $ 65 a share, following the earlier <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> offer of a leveraged buyout that would pay $ 61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of Lucky's outstanding shares. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> would also have issued preferred shares valued at $ 7 a share for the remaining shares. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' second bid followed the disclosure of confidential information by Lucky to American, under the stipulation that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would either sweeten its offer or end its hostile bid. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> initiated the bidding with a $ 45-a-share offer that Lucky rejected in March. Lucky also turned down an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' proposal to increase the bid to $ 50 a share in a negotiated acquisition. The company stated at the time that it considered both offers inadequate. In 1986, <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> underwent a series of restructuring moves designed to thwart a takeover bid by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>.
