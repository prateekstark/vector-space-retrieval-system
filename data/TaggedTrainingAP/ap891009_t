 Some might think a television show about home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry. But PBS' `` This Old House'' has long since proved that Americans love to watch other people fix up fixer-uppers. Now `` This Old House'' has this new host: <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an eclectic blend of <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. PBS officials hope that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 36, an expert sailor, carpenter, world traveler and writer, will dispel the whiff of scandal that hovered over the show when its original host, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>, left over a conflict of interest. The popular <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> began as co-host of the show with master carpenter <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> 11 years ago. He left after last season when an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s commercial endorsements. The show is produced at <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and is broadcast more than 500 times a week by 315 PBS stations across the country, reaching 15 million viewers and standing as public television's highest-rated half-hour show The new season of `` This Old House'' premiered in some parts of the country last weekend, and will be seen in other places later this week. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s departure prompted a flurry of more than 400 videotapes and resumes from people vying for the job. About half the applicants were television professionals. Others had little more than rudimentary carpentry credentials and a pickup truck. A concert pianist and a brain surgeon were among those interested. But the man who won the job never applied. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who had almost no on-camera television experience, was in northwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> researching his new book on the Arctic during the search for <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s successor He had returned to the 1836 Colonial revival house he shares with his wife and 3-year-old son on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> and was in the middle of his own renovation project _ constructing skylights _ when he got a call from <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON> was calling about <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' film `` The Last Navigator,'' which aired on PBS stations in July. But during the phone call, she mentioned that <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s job was open and suggested <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> apply for the job. Ten days and one screen test later, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> _ who combines <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON>'s sailing zeal with <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s philosophical self-reliance and <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s telegenic good looks _ had the job. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the grandson of a missionary who worked with Eskimos in isolated Point Hope, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, appears to have inherited the hardy stock of his forebears. Since graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has built boats, worked construction, skippered ships across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, studied ancient celestial navigation with a master navigator, written a book and helped produce a PBS film. His latest project is a book about the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region where his father was born called `` The Wilderness of Ice and Mind.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is fairly modest about his accomplishments. `` Basically, I'm a bum,'' he said in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, where he and <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> will be dismantling an 1835 barn for most of this year's show, turning it into a single-family home. `` I've done a bunch of different stuff. There are those who would say I've never had a regular job.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has supported himself since college by avoiding the office and desk grind. He grew up in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he learned to sail and surf early. He also learned home renovation firsthand from his father, who fixed up houses and sold them. After college, he sailed and raced extensively around the world. During a 1979 voyage between the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Marquesas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the remote <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> without electronic navigation instruments, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> lost the nautical equivalent of an odometer and had to rely on his eyes to measure the speed of the boat. `` I found I could do it accurately,'' he recalled. `` I decided I wanted to become completely self-reliant.'' His desire to learn ancient navigation led him to a master navigator in <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> who spoke only Satawalese. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> learned the language enough to understand the navigator during a yearlong apprenticeship. He later wrote `` The Last Navigator'' about the experience. It became a segment for PBS' `` Adventure'' series. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he spent a weekend considering the `` This Old House'' job _ and whether or not `` they'd even want me for it.'' Once he was hired, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he stuck close to the show's creator and producer, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Morash </PERSON>, and operated on `` fear and adrenaline. He has done eight shows so far and said he has grown more comfortable in front of the camera. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morash </PERSON> talked about a `` 10-year commitment and that sounded fine to me.'' He calls the job, with its July to March shooting schedule, ideal for a writer and craftsman. `` I have a tremendous respect and admiration for true craftsmanship, the way a person unites his craft with the rest of his life. It's pretty amazing you can communicate something you feel deeply about _ and that's part of this job.''

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> never doubted her husband had been scarred in mind and body by his <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> captors, that he was a tarnished and troubled war hero. The night nearly 20 years ago, when her sneakers seemed to drive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> berserk, was all the proof she needed. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> told her later that his captors used to wear sneakers when they came to his bamboo cage to beat him and urinate on him, and that the enemy soldier he strangled when he escaped also was wearing canvas shoes. Then there was the manuscript her husband left when he died this summer at the age of 46 of self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning _ 449 pages of vivid <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experiences. But <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> had never been to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, let alone been a hero. Misled by <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, his therapist, Dr. <PERSON> Corydon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, had concluded that he suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome and was `` very much a casualty of the Vietnam War.'' A letter <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> wrote after <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s death included a general account of what he believed was his patient's <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> war experience _ 15 days of torment as a prisoner of war after the USS Ranger-based F-4 fighter on which <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> was navigator was shot down in early 1966. `` He was clearly depressed, guilt-ridden, angry, alienated from people and viewed the world in a very negative manner as a result of his military service experiences, particularly as a prisoner of war,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> wrote. But Fife's heroic identity was adopted to cover a lifetime of failure. His image, maintained through 23 years of marriage, was shattered only when his widow tried to have his name included on the state's Vietnam War memorial, using the letter from <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> as part of her evidence. The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Era </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided last month after some debate to place <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s name on the granite and marble structure, to be dedicated Saturday. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s would have been the last of 390 names on the memorial. But while an artisan was preparing to engrave <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s name, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who had searched unsuccessfully for veterans who served with the dead hero told Mrs. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> that her husband had lied. `` I feel like I've been raped,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> said after being told of the deception revealed by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records. After a great deal of anguish, she decided to tell the truth to her 21-year-old son and her 19-year-old daughter. `` Intellectually I know I have the right to be angry,'' she said, `` but even with all of this I first need to understand it all.'' <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> did n't usually talk much about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but his wife had accompanied him to his first session with <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> in 1986, when he used the old fiction to try to justify his life. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> had acquired a certificate, purportedly from the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, listing the medals he said he had burned at the time to protest bad treatment of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. They included the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the service's highest award for valor. Lt. J.G. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, after 130 missions over enemy territory, was `` one of only four naval aviators to escape from enemy prison camps,'' according to the certificate, which appeared to be signed by Admiral <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorer </PERSON>, retired chief of naval operations. At the reporter's request, <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Awards and Special Projects Branch, tracked down <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s real <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records They showed he enlisted in September 1965 and was discharged eight months later as medically unfit because of bones broken in his right foot during childhood that had n't mended properly. His only medal was the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Award _ given to everyone. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> wanted to be remembered as the hero in his manuscript, not as a man obsessed by the circumstances of his birth. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> never knew his father and blamed his mother for making him `` a bastard,'' said a sister, <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Turcsanski </PERSON>. His wife, who met him in the months following his brief naval service, knew him as a pornography addict who spent hours alone with his erotic trove. Friends and relatives knew <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> as unreliable, angry, a dreamer, a failed businessman who gambled away $ 172,000 of a partner's money, a sometime truck driver, a would-be writer <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, co-director of the sex and marital therapy clinic at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not entirely surprised to learn <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> was no hero. Assuming the identity of a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran was assuming a disability that would excuse his deficiencies and gain him sympathy and understanding, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` He was what we call personality disorder, meaning very nonconforming, rebellious, somewhat anti-social,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` I suspect the manuscript may have been a sort of last-ditch effort at salvaging a little bit of self-esteem.''

 A first-term state representative and physician is in the center of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s abortion storm this week because he's the only legislator who performs abortions, making him a lightning rod for protests. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> even gets hate mail. `` They need something to marshal their forces around,'' he said of abortion opponents. The obstetrician-gynecologist's <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> women's clinic drew a raucous demonstration Saturday, three days before the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> was to begin a special session on abortion called by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` They were frustrated by the -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. They decided to make me the target, an ideal situation with the legislative session coming up,'' <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said Monday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week cited the state privacy law to strike down a 1988 statute requiring minors to get parental consent for abortion, uphold a woman's unrestricted right to abortion in the first trimester, and emphasize individual privacy rights in abortion decision-making. The governor acted within weeks of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 ruling upholding <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> state restrictions on abortions, making <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> the first state since then to call a session devoted to abortion. At Saturday's demonstration, <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said several of his patients, none there for abortions, were jostled by a 200-strong crowd and others were scared away. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> says he performs two or three abortions a week and only as part of his practice. The Rev. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion group that demonstrates at clinics, was arrested and charged with assault on a police officer, obstructing justice without violence and trepassing. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> called Operation Rescue `` a terrorist organization'' and said he will seek a restraining order against the group and damages. His office has been picketed before. But the latest protest was perhaps the most strident, he said. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, among many legislators who opposes holding the special session, said his mail has gone in recent weeks from evenly split to mostly anti-abortion. `` There have been more gory pictures -LRB- of fetuses -RRB- and more hate mail,'' said <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, a German-born Jew offended by packets with pictures of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and fetuses that contend aborting fetuses is comparable to the Holocaust. `` Someone wrote: ` It's too bad <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> did n't finish off your family,''' he said. Thousands of activists on both sides of the abortion issue are flocking here this week but <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> is confident legislators will be protected by Capitol and local police, who have set up command posts and video monitors and trained a 40-member riot squad. Being in the middle of demonstrations is n't the role <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> wants to play. `` I'd like to be there to cut through the propaganda, be available to ask questions and answer questions, and make sure the facts come out in an intelligent manner,'' <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said. Last month, he circulated `` A Legislator's Guide to Abortion Issues.'' <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said his 27-page handbook has been positively received, although anti-abortion forces say he should n't necessarily be considered an expert Said state Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Banjanin </PERSON>: `` I think every member of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is very knowledgeable on this issue. I think abortions are the murder of unborn children.'' `` I question whether he can approach this issue objectively, considering that he has a profit motive involved in what can come out of this session,'' added <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, political director for <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, 41, in practice for 12 years, said he initially opposed abortions, which were illegal when he entered medical school at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said abortions are only a small part of his practice and that many are performed on older women whose health could be jeopardized by pregnancy. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, married father of daughters ages 18, 17 and 12 years, has proposed a statewide study panel. `` Everything's not black-and-white on this issue,'' he said. `` Now we're talking about a three-day session where we're going to solve all these complicated questions. It's unrealistic.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> opens its season today not with the works of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> or Puccini but with a tale of the Crusades written by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, former drummer for the rock group <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` Holy Blood and Crescent Moon'' is bona fide opera, a love story with arias, choruses, grandiose sets and sweeping gestures, drawn from <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s research and observations on Holy Land history and current situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who spent six years with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> before going on to score movies and television shows, said Monday he does n't put himself in the same league as the masters but did use the qualities found in traditional opera. `` The music is definitely very brooding,'' he said. `` It's very bombastic. I use the orchestra to its fullest.'' The opera, which took four years to write, is the result of <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> making good on a flip remark during a 1984 press conference after he had written music for a ballet to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> When asked when he would write another ballet, he said it would be `` after I finish my opera.'' The son of Cleveland Opera General Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamberger </PERSON> heard that remark and urged his father to commission <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who had ventured from rock music to write scores for the movie `` Rumblefish'' and the TV series `` The Equalizer.'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, 37, said he knew little about opera when he agreed to write one, and he had to learn to love the dissonant voices and grand drama. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, whose father headed the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and who grew up in the region, said elements of the same story are in the war-wracked <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> of recent years It tells the tale of <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON>, prince of the Franks, and <PERSON> Dahlia </PERSON>, daughter of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ruler, who help each other despite the wars their people wage in the name of the land.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Communist government is holding a big bash this year for the 2540th birthday of Confucius, the philosopher once reviled for his reactionary ideas. The old sage, while still taken to task as a father of Chinese feudalism, has now entered the party pantheon as a thinker who embodied such socialist virtues as harmony, stability and obedience. New Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, in a meeting with Confucian scholars Sunday, described Confucius -LRB- 551-479 B.C. -RRB- as a `` great ancient thinker of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> as adding, `` it is necessary to select the essence while discarding the dross from his thought. The good side of his thought, in particular, should be used to educate the younger generation in helping them inherit and carry forward fine national traditions.'' Some 300 scholars from 20 nations are holding a symposium on Confucian thought in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and Confucius' birthplace of <LOCATION> Qufu </LOCATION>, 300 miles to the south. It is being co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, Science and Culture Organization. An exhibition on Confucius' life and work also opened at the Capital Museum, a former Confucian temple. Sacrificial rites were observed, the first time <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has staged a large-scale ceremony in memory of Confucius since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in 1949. <LOCATION> Qufu </LOCATION> is also holding its first Confucius Cultural Festival to mark the Sept. 28 birth of the sage whose ideas on filial piety and social order still wield considerable influence in such <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Much of the hoopla has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to revive its flagging tourist industry and develop <LOCATION> Qufu </LOCATION> as a tourist town. But it also reflects the new appraisal of the old thinker. The Confucian tenets of loyalty, stability, sacrificing oneself for the social good and obedience to one's masters have won favor from the current Communist government, which is now seeking to reassert control after crushing the pro-democracy movement this spring. Confucianism, which through Chinese history gained religious status with its own temples, was often been a target of Chinese progressives. Leaders of the May 4th Movement of 1919, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student-led campaign for democratic reform, said it represented agrarian feudal values, denigrated women and showed excessive respect for precedence, creating an obstacle to progress. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s revolutionaries, with their determination to overturn traditional class order, rejected Confucius while seizing the same `` mandate of heaven'' the scholar once bestowed on the imperial family. In 1973 the Cultural Revolution government launched a massive anti-Confucius, anti-Lin <PERSON> Biao </PERSON> campaign, linking <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s heir-apparent who died in a plane crash after failing to assassinate <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in 1971, to Confucius' reactionary ideology The movement assailed those trying to restore `` feudalism, capitalism and revisionism'' and accused Confucius of advocating the establishment of a slave society. After the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution ended, <PERSON> Confucius </PERSON> was rehabilitated. `` For centuries, people have either exalted and glorified him, or disparaged and belittled him,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in an article on the `` profound influence'' of Confucian ideas on contemporary <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` But none can add to or detract from his position in Chinese history as an outstanding thinker, statesman, educator and classicist, deserving to be called a cultural giant of the world.''

<HEAD>Prices Steady as Crude Oil Supplies Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unusual autumn rise in retail gasoline prices has slowed nearly to a halt because of abundant oil supplies and volume discounts to sellers, an industry analyst said. The biweekly <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations nationwide shows the average price, including taxes, for all grades of gasoline was $ 109.56 a gallon _ up 0.13 cent a gallon from two weeks earlier. The usual pattern of rising spring and summer prices, with fall reductions based on slower consumption, was turned on its head this year, analyst <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. `` They rose in spring, fell in summer and rose in the fall. At any rate, the situation seems to be returning to normal,'' she said. Rising insurance and other costs to retailers have made it important for them to sell in high volume, something oil companies are pushing by offering volume discounts, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. At self-service stations, the latest <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> shows regular leaded at 96.87 cents a gallon, regular unleaded at 98.49 cents and premium unleaded at $ 1.16. At full-service pumps, regular unleaded was $ 1.26 a gallon, regular unleaded was $ 1.27 and premium unleaded was $ 1.40.

<TEXT>
 Nearly five centuries after <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> set sail, scientists still debate whether <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> explorers unleashed the scourge of syphilis on the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. A study says it might have been the other way around. Research by two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> anthropologists cites studies of skeletal remains that they say show forms of syphilis existed in the New World before <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and his crew landed. In contrast, the researchers said studies from the pre-1492 Old World show almost no evidence of syphilis. Doctoral candidate <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Professor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armelagos </PERSON> base part of their conclusions on an apparent epidemic of syphilis in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 1500s. Their research was presented in an article, `` The Origin and Antiquity of Syphilis,'' which appeared in a recent issue of Current Anthropology. An opposing theory holds that venereal syphilis was present in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before it was transported by the explorers to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but at the time the disease was not distinguished from leprosy. Another theory suggests the disease has occurred independently in both continents. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> researchers cite one case of a skull showing signs of syphilis from a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cemetery. But they note the cemetery was used between 1197 and 1537, and it is impossible to date the bone exactly. Another case from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> could be pre-Columbian, the researchers note, raising the possibility that Norse explorers brought the disease back to their country. Explorers led by <PERSON> Leif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ericson </PERSON> are acknowledged to have landed in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> a little more than 500 years before <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Syphilis is detected by such marks as lesions on bones and marks on skulls, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. It is usually transmitted sexually and, if untreated, it can lead to the degeneration of bones, heart and nerve tissue. Several skeletons marked by syphilis have been excavated in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> but the dating is uncertain, the study said. A handful of possibly pre-Columbian syphilitic bones have been found in southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but that is compared to hundreds of discoveries in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Whether a European epidemic of syphilis occurred after the sailors' return is n't entirely clear. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armelagos </PERSON> conclude it did after reviewing documents, studies of bones and numerous ordinances passed throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1490s concerning the disease. Opposing theorists say the outbreak merely reflected the recognition that syphilis was distinct from leprosy. The various explanations of the origin of syphilis have fascinated scientists for two reasons _ sex and politics, says <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesolowsky </PERSON>, managing editor of the Journal of Field Archeology at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` First, syphilis is a venereal disease and so anything connected with sex often has an interest in and of its own,'' he said. The question also has political implications in light of a growing awareness that Native Americans see 1492 as an invasion that led to their exploitation and devastation by imported diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis, he said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on American Indian Affairs, said the disease could have been circulated from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and from there to the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. But he professed little interest in the debate, and said his agency is working on the more pressing issue of halting excavation and public display of Native Americans' bones. <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said a bigger issue than the origin of syphilis is the way <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' travels have been characterized. `` The conclusions of the Incan and pre-Incan civilizations, their importance and their sophistication has really been minimized,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> dominated in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> until the Spanish conquest. <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said there were an estimated 30 million Indians in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> in 1492, and just 400,000 in 1900. `` That's the story of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Along a dimly lit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> thoroughfare apartment dwellers wave sparklers, cheer and applaud from balconies, urging on thousands of people demonstrating for democratic reform. In a crowded, smoke-filled bar, a young man shouts `` Happy birthday police state'' and his companions assail the repressive policies of the hard-line Communist government. They jeer at weekend celebrations marking the state's 40th anniversary. In the most dramatic show of public dissatisfaction in more than three decades, East Germans have sent a clear message to the aging leadership: they want reform and momentum for change is growing. At least 50,000 East Germans gave up hope that the orthodox Communist government was capable of change and have fled West since mid-September in the largest such exodus since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961. For many left behind, anger over the government's intolerance of change and dissent came into full force as authorities trumpeted four decades of achievements in elaborate ceremonies. Public discontent translated into massive street protests in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and at least five provincial cities on a scale that had n't been seen since a 1953 workers' revolt was crushed by Soviet tanks. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders -RRB- have ignored and underestimated just how many people are fed up with this lousy system,'' said a 30-year-old East German woman who asked not to be identified because she feared reprisal. Hope for change has taken on new urgency as democratic reform sweeps the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. East Germans hope Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can help bring change to this country of 16.6 million. But East German leaders have rejected the need for change and routinely suppress fledgling opposition groups. Prominent opposition activists are frequently expelled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Open dissent has traditionally been suppressed swiftly and brutally by security forces, but the weekend crushing of street protests was the most violent in recent memory. `` The only people who are satisfied here are people who reap party privileges,'' one man said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls most aspects of everyday life and although East Germans enjoy a higher standard of living than their East bloc neighbors, the atmosphere is clouded by gloom and a sense of powerlessness. Many complain of the severe restrictions imposed on travel to the West. Even within the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was the only country East Germans could travel to freely. Then, last week, that border was closed. The mass emigration of East Germans that helped stir the recent protests is a principal topic of conversation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` It's not easy to give up everything and leave friends and family behind,'' said a 24-year-old waitress. Others weigh the achievements in some spheres against life in a repressive state. `` Most East Germans would say that they are proud of many of the social benefits socialism has brought to the people,'' said a 27-year-old university student, referring to free day-care and medical treatment. `` But a joyless, restricted life is the price we're paying for it.'' Those who have decided to stay and work for change are buoyed by new opposition groups and the spontaneous support for the pro-democracy demonstrations. `` I still have hope,'' said a 35-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man who said he was fired from an adminstrative job after openly defending a human rights group. `` This is only the beginning.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> prepared to start the countdown for the space shuttle Atlantis today despite the promise of anti-nuclear activists to sit on the launch pad if necessary to block a payload that carries radioactive plutonium. Pending a federal judge's approval, <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> is to lift off at 1:29 p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to explore the planet Jupiter. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> decided to begin the count on schedule this morning even though a decision is pending on a lawsuit by three citizens' groups seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the launch. The groups contend that an explosion on liftoff could spread cancer-causing plutonium particles over a large area of east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials say the two nuclear-powered generators aboard <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> have been thoroughly tested and that flying them poses minimal health and environmental risks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> scheduled oral arguments on the suit for Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. This is the first time anyone has gone to court to stop a space launch. The space agency said it could stop the countdown at the 11-hour mark for several days to await the judge's decision, if necessary. The activists have said that if they lose in court, they will attempt to block the flight by infiltrating the launch area Thursday. `` We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the groups that filed the suit. More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to stop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by helicopters and boats. `` They indicated to us and to the press an intent to do some back-country-type activities to try to stop the launch,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>, deputy director of the space center's security office. `` We are postured to try to prevent that.'' There is only a 10-minute launch period available on Thursday, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is concerned the time could be consumed if protesters penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or on foot in the final minutes of the countdown. The astronauts who will fly the mission were to arrive here this afternoon from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. All five said they are not concerned about flying with plutonium. `` I have absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The generators, each containing 24.7 pounds of radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide, were installed Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe stored in Atlantis' cargo bay. Officials said without nuclear power, spacecraft could not function at distant planets like <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> because they are too far away to draw energy from the sun. In a brief filed last week, the citizens' groups said the government underestimated or covered up the danger of plutonium contamination from any shuttle explosion like the one that destroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> responded that the organizations were spreading a `` tale of horrors,'' and that tests show the generators would survive a Challenger-like explosion. The agency said similar generators have flown on 22 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe accidents _ two rocket blowups and a fiery re-entry through Earth's atmosphere The probability of a release of plutonium in a launching accident is less than 1 in 2,500, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The opponents put the odds at 1 in 430.

 A case involving an unwitting jailhouse confession by a murder suspect could change the scope of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s Miranda ruling on the rights of criminal suspects. The high court last week agreed to review a ruling by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appellate court. The state court said the confession should be suppressed because it was made before the suspect was advised of his right to remain silent and have an attorney, both guaranteed under the 1966 Miranda ruling. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 24, thought he was confiding in two inmates in a county jail in 1986 when he allegedly admitted to a drug-related slaying. But one of the `` inmates'' was an undercover police officer, planted in jail to quiz <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. Prosecutors say the confession is the cornerstone of their murder case against <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, who could face the death penalty if convicted. `` We ca n't win without it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON>, state's attorney in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> But the appellate court, in a 1988 ruling, declared that <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' statements `` were not given through a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights, but were in fact the questionable product of an intentional subversion of those rights.'' The court rejected the prosecutors' argument that <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> applies only in those situations where a figure of authority directly interrogates a suspect. `` There is no authority in these circumstances for the police to do indirectly what they may not do directly,'' the court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year refused to hear the case. Defense attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said he does n't think the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling is likely to have a widespread impact. `` Nobody has ever tried to any great extent having undercover cops in jail,'' he said. But <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said that could change with a favorable <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. He said law-enforcement officials have tended to back away from such investigative techniques when they believe they already have a strong case against a defendant and do n't want to jeopardize it. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities had no suspects in the November 1984 killing of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> until early 1986. Then <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, an inmate at the <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, told police that <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> had admitted to killing someone in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area two years earlier. At the time, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was the prison on a theft charge. Authorities obtained a court order for <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>'s release from prison to assist in their investigation. In 1986, police planted undercover officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> as escaped convicts; <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was at that jail awaiting trial on an unrelated charge. <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> renewed his acquaintance with <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> and introduced him to <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, and the three began plotting an escape, according to prosecutors. Police said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> told <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> that a man had paid him $ 5,000 to cripple <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> because <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> owed the man money for drugs and had been having an affair with the man's wife. Court documents did n't identify the man who allegedly hired <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. Prosecutors say the confession should be allowed as evidence because <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> could not have thought he was undergoing coercive police questioning at the time. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> is currently serving a 30-year sentence in the <ORGANIZATION> Menard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on an unrelated aggravated battery conviction. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials can not hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in custody to make incriminating statements. The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _ handed down two years before <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> _ that barred government agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation.

 Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was somber as the 135-mph winds of Hurricane Hugo roared outside, wrenching the tin roof off <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s antebellum City Hall. `` All we can do now is pray,'' he said quietly to a handful of staff and reporters gathered in his candlelit office to ride out the storm. From that dark hour, the 46-year-old mayor emerged as a symbol of the determination with which residents are digging out from the Sept. 21 hurricane, the worst storm to hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in a century. He organized a relief effort which brought tons of supplies and hundreds of thousands of dollars to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, much of which was sent to storm-ravaged areas miles from the city. He also imposed a curfew to prevent looting and took quick steps to prevent price gouging. `` He was there the entire time. He was in the shelters and he was always there with the people,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, a paralegal. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, an administrative secretary at a law firm, agreed. `` He was totally in charge,'' she said. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> worked 18-hour days through the clean-up effort and fielded hundreds of questions daily from the media. He was sharply critical of the federal response to the disaster, blasting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for what he said was an inadequate response. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials blasted <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> back, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, defended <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts. `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is providing everything the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> needs. We're talking about one of the most devastating storms in recent history. It's being done,'' he said. That storm has mostly passed. Now, the mayor is spending much of his time urging tourists to return to the 319-year-old city. He said the city has bounced back. In an interview last week, he wore a T-shirt proclaiming `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, Going Strong.'' Scattered around room were cards and letters from people moved by <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s plight. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who has served as mayor for more than a decade, had urged residents a day before <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck to evacuate low-lying areas. He directed his staff to contact mayors of cities hit by hurricanes in recent years to pick their minds about preparations. Hurricane Hugo toppled dozens of buildings in the city and damaged about 80 percent of the roofs. But <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said the miracle is that so few lives were lost _ only one in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Seventeen other deaths across the state were attributed to the storm. `` This hurricane had blood on its mind,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Throughout the ordeal, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said his most enduring impression of the storm was the courage of his fellow Charlestonians. `` People who lost homes say they're lucky to be alive. People who lost a roof say they're lucky to have a house. The people are courageous, and thankful and spirited,'' the mayor said.

<TEXT>
 Six climbers were found dead in the northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> today after the season's first snow and two others from the same group died later after being evacuated by helicopter, police said. The eight _ six men and two women _ were members of a 10-member party from western <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION> and neighboring towns who started a climb Saturday and planned to return today, said <PERSON> Toyama </PERSON> Prefectural police. The climbers, who ranged in age from the late 40s to 60s, may have died of exposure after getting caught in a sudden snowstorm in light clothing, local press reports said. It was the most people killed in a mountaineering accident in <LOCATION> Japoan </LOCATION> since March 1982, when 12 climbers were killed in an avalanche in the central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>. A local police officer said six climbers were found dead when rangers arrived this morning in mountains near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Masago </LOCATION>, a 9,438-foot peak in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Two others found wandering near a ridgeline were conscious when the rangers arrived but died at a hospital later after being evacuated by helicopter, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said rangers found two other members of the group wandering near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Masago </LOCATION>. One was taken by a police helicopter to a hospital in <LOCATION> Toyama </LOCATION>, 160 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and the other was under treatment at a nearby mountain hut. Their condition was not immediately known. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, one of the two rescued, as saying one of the group's members fell ill Sunday afternoon during the hike to Mt. <PERSON> Masago </PERSON>. They were caught in season's first snow, the police officer said.

 Churches around the country can help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> rebuild by adopting a family victimized by Hurricane Hugo, Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` This long-term recovery process is going to take long-term support,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> told about 300 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Citadel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Sunday. `` Many families have lost everything. They are not going to bounce back from those circumstances,'' he said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 24 counties and 1.8 million people were affected as <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> rolled through the state Sept. 21, killing 18 and causing damage estimated at up to $ 5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> has held several news conferences since the storm, but Sunday was the first time he spoke about the storm in person to a formal gathering of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> residents. Services at the 134-year-old church in downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, which itself suffered some $ 250,000 in roof, window and other damage, were taped for broadcast on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> used the opportunity to promote the Adopt-A-Family program announced last week as a means of linking individual congregations with families affected by the hurricane. He urged all willing churches to contact their <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counterparts, which in turn would put them in touch with troubled families. The churches are needed, the Republican governor said, to provide `` spiritual, material and moral support `` for up to a year. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s wife, <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, who conceived the plan, said church leaders are supportive. But she said many congregations would consider the program for the first time Sunday and it was too early to tell how many congregations will participate. `` We'll be back,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> told his audience. `` With the spirit now in this state, with the help of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and with the help of God, we'll rebuild, and we'll reestablish and we will endure.'' Meanwhile, about 3,000 of <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas' 132,000 Charleston-area customers remained without power Sunday, said company spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lide </PERSON>.

 The dollar eased slightly against the Japanese yen Monday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> gained ground. The dollar closed at 142.23 yen, down 0.22 yen from Friday's close of 142.45 yen After opening at 141.60 yen, the currency moved in a range of 141.60-142 .28 yen On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 313.64-point loser Friday, won back 167.00 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 35,376.35.

 Police found the bullet-riddled body of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> army commander's private secretary stashed in a car just hours after the president swore in a new justice minister and two other Cabinet officers. <PERSON> Nury </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> was kidnapped Friday in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine center, and her body was found Sunday 10 miles to the northwest, in <LOCATION> Marinilla </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility for the slaying. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> army brigade has been active in confiscating properties allegedly belonging to traffickers. The confiscations are part of the government's 2-month-old crackdown on the country's cocaine barons <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s new justice minister, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON>, is the ninth to serve under President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. He was sworn in along with Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> and Communications Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Danies </PERSON> <PERSON> Rincones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, replaces <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, 32, who resigned after death threats from drug traffickers during the 70 days she served in office. Shortly after taking office, <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> told reporters he did not fear traffickers, who are thought to have killed former Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> in 1984. He reiterated his pledge to carry out `` firmly and fairly'' the extradition of Colombian drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where many face trafficking and money-laundering charges. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, drug barons have operated with relative impunity by paying off or intimidating judges. The new justice minister faces the difficult task of pushing forward the unprecedented government crackdown, which <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared a day after traffickers assassinated the leading presidential contender. In retaliation, traffickers declared war on the government. Since mid-August, 148 bombings and arson attacks have killed 10 people and injured 164 in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital, and <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. In commencing the crackdown, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> issued emergency decrees allowing the extradition of cocaine barons and the seizure of their property. He has said he will not negotiate with traffickers, who want to hold talks with the government on its new extradition policy. But in newspaper interviews published Sunday, a former interior minister said he carried messages from the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> _ the world's largest drug trafficking organization _ to a top aide to <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> as saying that although there were no direct negotiations, the president's general secretary, <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, did not discourage indirect contacts with traffickers. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, who apparently acted on orders from <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION>, was willing to consider negotiations if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to participate. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government opposition made talks impossible, <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said. In a communique, <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said his decision to meet with <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> was a personal one and that he told the former interior minister a dialogue between the government and the cartel was impossible. Also Sunday, an explosion and fire killed seven people and injured eight on a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> bus. Police initially said they thought it was caused by an incendiary bomb but later said that theory was in question. The radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> quoted a policeman at the scene as saying the fire originated from a five-gallon plastic container filled with gasoline that had been carried by a passenger. Three children were among the victims, who struggled in vain to climb out of the burning bus, police said.

<TEXT>
 Wildlife specialists have squared off for a bitter fight over how to keep <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s endangered elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys and chess pieces. Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet through Oct. 20 at the biennial conference of the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>. There were strategy sessions Sunday, but the conference formally opens today. Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, the salmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species, attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory. By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, for many an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoos by the turn of the century. `` When we talk about halving the population in 10 years, we're talking about disaster,'' <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON>, a widely respected expert, said in an interview from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Western </PERSON> of Wildlife Conservation International, who commissioned the last census, said: `` Numbers are dropping so fast elephants may be exterminated in most areas within 20 or 30 years.'' Overall, he said, just more than 600,000 remain in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, compared to estimates ranging from 1.3 million to 4 million a decade ago. Each year, poachers kill at least 70,000, often spraying gunfire at females and calves along with the few old tuskers left. In <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> alone, fewer than 17,000 are left of the 165,000 elephants counted in 1970. The convention's rulings become non-legally binding agreements that rely on international pressure for enforcement. A convention member may abstain from a resolution, but risks being branded an environmental bad guy. Delegates must find common ground between the East African demand for an ivory ban, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s push for trade in culled tusks. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> argue that careful management has increased their herds and that ivory finances anti-poaching measures. `` We have a very healthy elephant population that must be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' <PERSON> Bosman </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> earns $ 9 million a year by selling ivory from herds estimated at 52,000. `` You do n't ban something valuable, you protect it,'' said <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of the Save Endangered African Wildlife, which works in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nduku </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s director of parks and wildlife said, `` It's not fair to treat <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as if it was a small country.'' But a broad coalition of experts and environmentalists, including <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, say that exceptions to a ban leave doors wide open to abuse. `` These arguments are based on a pack of lies: the numbers, the level of poaching and the ability to control trade,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON> of the Washington-based Monitor Consortium. Elephants and poachers ignore orders, experts say, and trade in wildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking. Documents are easy to falsify. For example, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> lost its last elephant, an old bull, years ago, but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons per year of ivory. In 1986, the convention granted a blanket amnesty to 89 tons of ivory in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> as the start of an African quota system. Since then, convention officials admit another 87 tons of ivory _ the tusks of nearly 15,000 elephants _ have appeared in the nation. The ban lobby is countered by well-funded traders, mostly based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, who fear an end to a billion-dollar industry in carvings, jewelry and personalized name stamps used widely in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. African elephants fall under the convention's Appendix Two for threatened species. Controlled trade is allowed in that category. Shifting them to Appendix One, endangered species, would mean a ban. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON>, secretary-general of the convention, has recommended a split-listing placing elephants on Appendix One but allowing those countries with controlled legal trade to continue. He said a total ban might force some member countries to declare reservations, allowing them to bypass convention guidelines. Western said he favors a ban but with accommodation for southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, under strict control. He is working on a method of tracing tusks based on genetic `` fingerprinting.'' But many specialists express concern that complex exceptions could lead to the end of elephants in the wild. Experts note the southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> group includes <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where lingering civil wars have decimated wildlife. Mozambican rebels and Zambian poachers frequently penetrate Zambian reserves. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, author of `` Elephant Memories,'' said, `` <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> is wearing blinders. They can not stop the poaching.'' Van Note testified before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year that poaching is rampant in parts of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A few recent incidents suggest serious problems. Last month, South African newspapers reported a plane that crashed on takeoff from an <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> rebel camp was overloaded with ivory. The Portuguese pilot, <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON>, owned a truck found earlier in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> with 7 tons of tusks. The plane was carrying three <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> legislators, including <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, son of President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, who had visited the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> was badly injured. Last year, after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups accused <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> of helping <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> finance its rebellion by trafficking ivory, a South African board of inquiry denied any large-scale military involvement. But the board said the army did help <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> transport tusks from 1976 to 1979. Two South African army officers were among six people indicted last year in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on charges of smuggling rhino horn, skins of endangered animals and assault rifles into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Voters Rejects Plans Intended to Increase More Black Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan designed to elect more black judges has failed in part because of voter concern over a grandfather clause that would have protected the jobs of mostly white incumbents, analysts said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, an attorney for blacks who challenged the current election systems, said Sunday voters did n't support the proposals because `` there are ... people in the state not interested in providing equal opportunity to black candidates.'' `` In addition,'' he said, `` those ` no' votes were joined by people who are interested in giving opportunity to black candidates, but are not interested in giving special opportunities to white, male incumbents.'' Two proposed constitutional amendments _ one dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and another covering district and appellate judges _ were turned down overwhelmingly in every parish. The proposals received the most negative votes among 13 constitutional amendments decided Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> plan was rejected by 69 percent of the voters, while 70 percent opposed the other plan. In heavily black Orleans Parish, the propositions failed by 3-1 margins. The secretary of state said only 31 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. There were no major campaigns either for or against the propositions. A couple of other items on the ballot fared better. Voters overwhelmingly approved a 4-cent boost in gasoline taxes to finance a $ 1.4 billion highway improvement program; a special fund for coastal restoration projects; and a tough property confiscation measure aimed at drug dealers. The judicial propositions were drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in response to two suits alleging that the current election system for judges illegally dilutes black voting strength. Voter rejection probably will result in federal courts carving out new plans, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said Sunday he would meet with judges in hopes that the system can be revised without federal intervention. Currently, there are no black <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. There is one black among the state's 52 appellate court judges and five black district judges out of 192. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ordered a new system for district and appellate court judges. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> upheld the current <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> system, the decision is being appealed. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, additional district and appellate judgeships would have been carved from election districts. Although the judges would be elected on a subdistrict basis, they would have served the entire district. Also, 35 district and appellate judges who would be displaced by the new plans could opt for senior status, under which they would keep their jobs at full pay for eight to 10 years. `` I think the creation of senior judges was instrumental'' in the defeat, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Renwick </PERSON>, a veteran <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> political analyst. `` The people are n't going to fund that in an era where the funds are n't available -LRB- for -RRB- the basics.'' According to legislative estimates, the plans would have cost an additional $ 5.5 million over the next two years.

<HEAD>Ballots Printed For Riveredge, But No One Lives There</HEAD>

 Voter turnout is n't likely to be very good in <LOCATION> Riveredge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> next month. Ballots will be printed and a polling place has been designated _ but no one lives there anymore. `` Unless we hear from the courts or some other governmental body that it no longer exists, we still maintain it as a voting place,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cuyahoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>. The township is adjacent to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and once was the site of a 256-home trailer park. The last resident left in 1986. `` I lived there, my parents lived there, and my grandparents lived there, but there is n't any town there anymore,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullrich </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The ballot will have four spots _ three for township trustees and one for township clerk _ where the words `` No candidate filed for this position'' will be printed. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said election records showed the township has seven registered voters, all of whom either have died or moved away without notifying the board since 1985 _ the last time someone in Riveredge actually voted. `` It is bizzare, but we have to go through the motions,'' she told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the cost of holding the election will be minimal. `` We've put the polling place in conjunction with a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> precinct, so we do n't have to hire separate booth officials for Riveredge,'' she said. `` Provided anybody shows up, they will of course take care of the voters, but we kind of figure that <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> precinct can handle it.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen today, contributing to a gain by the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index. The dollar closed at 142.23 yen, down 0.22 yen from its close of 142.45 yen last Friday, when it rose 1.40 yen. The dollar opened today at 141.60 yen, its low for the day, and ranged as high as 142.28 yen. Currency dealers said the dollar's decline followed a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent in September from 5.2 percent in July and August. They said this might encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates, which would tend to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors. But a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar was expected to keep its strength in the long run. `` Now that the incentive to buy the dollar is calming down, it is uncertain whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> will continue to put upward pressure on -LRB- Japanese -RRB- interest rates,'' said the dealer, on condition of anonymity. He said the announcement of the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index later this week likely will give the market a direction. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 313.64-point loser on Friday, regained 167.00 points, or 0.47 percent, closing at 35,376.35. Securities dealers attributed the rebound to the dollar' easing against the Japanese yen. `` Investors were reacting favorably to the strengthening of the yen today,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, on condition of anonymity. Another dealer said, `` the environment is sound, but with a national holiday the next day, we ca n't really expect much market activity today.'' Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where major shares are listed, was estimated at 700 million shares. Banks, government offices, foreign exchange and stock markets and many businesses will be closed Tuesday for Sports Day, a national holiday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 CAP-PELE, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A logging truck crashed into a wagon that was taking relatives at a family reunion on a hayride, killing 12 people and injuring 45, many of whom were pinned or crushed by logs, witnesses said. Several of those injured in Sunday's crash were in critical condition and five of the dead were children, according to a hospital spokesmen in <LOCATION> Moncton </LOCATION>, 25 miles west of <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>, where the accident occurred. About 50 people were involved in Sunday's outing, part of a traditional family reunion in <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON> each Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Most were riding on the hay-covered wagon, which was being towed by a tractor when it was hit. Others were traveling behind in two pickup trucks, both of which were also hit by the logging truck. One tipped over and dumped its riders into a ditch. `` The logs ended up on the people when the truck failed to negotiate the curve'' on a two-lane highway, said a local resident, <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Leger </PERSON>, another local resident, said the tractor-trailor jack-knifed and fell on the hay-covered wagon. He said one man lost three members of his immediate family. `` The worst thing was that it happened only about 100 yards from the hall where the family reunion was being held,'' said <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogen </PERSON>, who works at a gas station in <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>. Stricken family members, many in tears, stumbled around the accident site desperately looking for relatives, a police officer said. The accident occurred on Highway 945 near <LOCATION> Cap-Pele </LOCATION> in the southeastern part of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, an eastern Canadian province. Some victims were pinned under the bales of hay. The driver of the tractor-trailer had to be pried from the wreckage, witnesses said. `` It's a terrible thing because everybody knows everybody around here,'' said <PERSON> Cecile </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>, an ambulance worker. `` They celebrate every year, and I guess ... it was not the right time this year.'' People on hayrides have been involved in several accidents in recent years, but none has been as serious. In September 1984, four youths died during a hayride near <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. A car hit them while they were changing hay wagons.

<HEAD>New Housing Agreement Called An End To Painful Chapter In Race Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City and civil rights leaders lauded an anti-discrimination housing settlement, but they disagreed on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s progress in overcoming the racial strife that flared in the mid-1970s with court-ordered busing. The settlement announced last week stemmed from a 1988 suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. It alleged that more than 2,000 minority families were discouraged from applying for housing in predominantly white developments or were denied such housing. The agreement provides up to $ 2,500 for families who were passed over. It also affirms a housing plan adopted last year to give priority to those who were discriminated against in tenant selection. In addition, a `` community benefit'' fund, estimated at $ 500,000, will supply grants to encourage integration and multicultural activities in the city's public housing developments. <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> officials said the settlement was a landmark agreement, since those who suffered discrimination will receive financial compensation. `` It was designed to show that if you do wrong, you're going to pay for it,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, the national executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the pact would end a painful era. `` This is the last barrier that remains that goes back to the turbulent 1970s and'80s,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully this will wipe the slate clean and everyone will be on a level playing field for housing.'' But others said the legacy of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s racially troubled past, when the city erupted in violence over school desegregation, was still alive, just not as obvious. `` What you're having is fewer rocks being thrown and there are n't demonstrations and rhetoric, but underneath it all there still is the cause,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a back leader and professor of community development at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Hooks said the root cause for housing inequity `` is pure and simple racism.'' He added, `` I'd like to think there was a change of heart, but that I do n't know. But at least in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> they're willing to uphold the law.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said much of the housing problems can be blamed on the failure to implement a policy adopted in 1978 that was intended to provide open housing for minorities. Officials did not follow through on the policy, he said, `` because they could not ensure the safety of minorities moving into neighborhoods.'' Just four years earlier, the busing of black students into predominantly white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> prompted protests, rock throwing and the flight of white students to private schools. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>, head of the housing committee for the local <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, agreed with city officials who said people's attitudes toward racial issues seemed to have changed. She said under the remedial housing arrangement affirmed in the settlement, blacks have been moving into predominantly white housing projects since last year, and `` those people are living a peaceful existence.''

<TEXT>
 Members of a Latvian nationalist movement have voted nearly unanimously to work to achieve not just autonomy but outright independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Delegates at the second annual congress of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latvia </ORGANIZATION>, voted late Sunday to approve a program aimed at preparing for independence _ though without specifying just when that might come. There was only one vote against the 126-point program from the 1,074 delegates, who carefully discussed the nuances of each clause in a debate that stretched into early today. The vice chairman of the Latvian state planning commission said the independence call could create problems in negotiating more economic freedom from the Kremlin. `` There is a direct link between the political situation and economic negotiations,'' <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Aboltins </PERSON> said. `` The more radical the slogans, the more difficult it is for us the day after in the corridors of power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' However, Sunday's debate was fairly free of the fiery rhetoric that would upset <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucrats, he said. The program calls for human rights, competing political parties and private business in a free-market economy. It is designed to build an independent economy and social structure before the republic secedes. On the autonomy clause, the delegates approved a declaration saying the front's goal `` is to restore the independence of the Latvian state by creating a democratic parliamentary republic.'' `` <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s social and political life has changed radically,'' the draft said. `` The possibility actually exists that an independent <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> can be renewed through non-violent means.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> annexed <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and its Baltic neighbors <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in 1940. In the past year, movements for autonomy have gained strength in all three republics, which have adopted measures calling for greater freedom from the Kremlin. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has voted itself the right to veto Soviet laws, made Latvian the official language and restored schools for ethnic minorities. The People's Front has gained the support of a leading Communist, Latvian Premier <PERSON> Vilnis-Edvins </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresis </PERSON>. He told the congress it should strive for `` real power for the people, with the fate of our native <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> determined and governed by the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bresis </PERSON> said he believed the republic's most urgent task is wresting control of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> economy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He did not explicitly back independence. He also warned that <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s reforms must not move too far ahead of countrywide efforts to overhaul the economy and political system, championed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claims 300,000 members among the Baltic republic's 2.7 million people. Its program was carefully worded to ensure wide support. The congress dropped a direct complaint about the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and wording that could have been interpreted as a threat to voting rights of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and other non-Latvian immigrants, who comprise half of the population.

<HEAD>Jewish Students Attacked By Gang in Brooklyn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A gang of youths shouthing ethnic slurs set upon three young Jewish men emerging from a party at a Jewish student center and beat them severely, leaving two in serious condition, authorities said. The police department's bias unit was investigating the incident, which took place on the eve of the solemn Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, said Sgt. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubler </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The attack prompted an immediate outcry from community leaders. `` They came out of a fraternity party and were set upon by about 15 white youths who called them names and then beat the daylights out of them,'' said city Councilman Noach Dear of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` They were beating up anybody who was n't of their kind,'' he said. Two <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> freshmen were beaten just after midnight Saturday when they emerged from a party at the <ORGANIZATION> Hillel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Jewish student center near the college campus, <PERSON> Kubler </PERSON> SAID. A third man was beaten when he came upon the gang and told them to stop, <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> said. Dear identified the two students as <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON>, both freshmen at the college. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> visited the students at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Dear said <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> had a fractured skull and <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> had a ruptured spleen, which was removed, a broken leg and injuries to one of his knees. Police said <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> was listed in serious condition. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> was in stable condition. The third victim, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Eilat </PERSON>, did not need to be admitted to the hospital, police said. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement for Jews, started at sunset Sunday. Dear said the young men had been told recently by their parents not to wear their yarmulkes, or religious skullcaps, late at night because of the possibility of attacks. `` It's unbelievable. We're living in a society where you have to hide your religious beliefs,'' <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> said. `` That reminds me of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. If I have to hide who I am, this is a terrible society.'' `` I knew I was n't supposed to wear the yarmulke, but I thought: Why not? I'm going to <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, that's my home territory,'' <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Jane's Says Soviet Tanks Have Edge on West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 New weapons and equipment have given the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an edge in tank forces that has allowed it to withdraw thousands of older tanks from the front line facing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, a new study said today. The Soviets no longer need so many tanks because their latest models are superior in some cases to those of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in armor, mobility and firepower said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>, editor of the 1989-1990 edition of the respected `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Armor and Artillery.'' <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> wrote in his foreword to the volume describing the world's armored vehicles and towed guns that the past year was dominated by the Soviet decision to withdraw some of its conventional forces from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without waiting for similar concessions from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> He said that what many observers failed to realize was that the quality of Soviet tanks had become superior. `` The introduction of the T-64, T-72 and T-80 main battle tanks gave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a quantum leap in that they introduced new tanks with significant improvements in armor, mobility and firepower over their earlier T-54, T-55 and T-62 tanks,'' <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> said. No <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> main battle tank has automatic gun-loading, which all three new Soviet tanks have, enabling them to carry as few as three crewmen, the editor said. Fire control systems for armored fighting vehicles throughout the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact have also been improved with a laser rangefinder replacing optical systems to give gunners a greater chance of hitting a target on the first shot, he said. New armor on Soviet tanks `` has made the vehicles virtually immune'' to penetration by shells from any <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tank, <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> said. `` The Soviet tank fleet consists of well over 50,000 vehicles of some five basic types excluding heavy tanks and World War II vehicles still held in reserve,'' the editor said.

 Most workers who take up an offer of early retirement from their bosses are happy with their decisions, according to a new study. `` The bottom line of early retirement is that if you're in good health and have enough financial resources to keep you going, you're likely to be happy in retirement,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, associate professor of human development and family relations at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>. Blank and two researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, a professor of social relations, and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, a professor of education _ surveyed 115 recent retirees. They had planned to study the problems people had when they took early retirement _ like alcoholism, depression and boredom _ but say they had trouble finding anybody who was miserable. Fifty percent of those surveyed were very satisfied in retirement, while 15 percent were dissatisfied. The rest were as happy as when they held their job. The unhappy retirees tended to feel they'd been forced out by an employer who no longer wanted them, <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The researchers advertised in a <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, newspaper for recent retirees to participate in the survey, and collected data for three years, from 1986 to 1988. They are continuing to analyze data and looking for a publisher. Ironically, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> have retired since the study began. Respondents said the thing they missed most about work was feeling useful and having a sense of responsibility. But <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said most respondents found other channels for those needs. About half do volunteer work and 40 percent work part-time, many as consultants for their former employers. The average age of those surveyed was 59. Seventy percent had planned to retire between the ages of 60 and 65. Most had worked for the same employer for the last 25 to 30 years in jobs ranging from high-level managers to administrative assistants. Corporations started using early retirement as a way to save money in the late 1970s and early 1980s when they discovered they were top-heavy with managers earning hefty salaries, <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said. Since then, a number of states have followed the private sector's lead. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, 62, spent more than two decades in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations office. He thought he'd retire at age 65. But the state, struggling to help close an $ 800 million budget gap, made <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> and other workers an offer: If they opted for early retirement, they'd receive a bonus and medical benefits. `` I thought putting all these things together would probably be to my benefit and to my family's benefit,'' said <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, who has made two picnic tables, redone a bathroom, refinished some furniture and written long-overdue thank-you notes in the month since he left work. `` I did it _ I left Sept. 1, and I love it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dispute Looms at Conference on Antarctica's Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Atop the agenda for officials from 39 countries gathered to map <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s future is the question of whether to leave the vast continent in pristine splendor or mine it for mineral wealth. The biennial review of the 1959 <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> Treaty, which opens today, will also consider issues such as the disposal of hazardous wastes and controlling the wave of tourists visiting the continent. But the question of whether to allow mining on the frozen continent is expected to be the most vigorously debated. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, whose policies have changed to reflect growing public concern for the environment, are pitted in the dispute against countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that generally favor regulated exploitation. In the past 15 months, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have reversed their positions on an international convention reached in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, that would open <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to carefully regulated mining. Thirty-three of the 39 nations adhering to the <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> Treaty initialed the accord in June 1988. `` Mining in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is not compatible with protection of the fragile Antarctic environment,'' Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said in a joint statement issued Aug. 18. Because the <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> Convention required unanimous agreement, their decision torpedoed the accord for the foreseeable future. The decision by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a country not known for its environmental policies, was a surprise to many diplomats. But, French officials said, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has realized that environmental problems such as global warming and the thinning of the earth's ozone shield require a global response. `` The mounting concern about the environment is indisputable,'' one Foreign Ministry official said in a background briefing. `` We feel it here in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and our partners undoubtedly feel it as well.'' Some countries, such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, fear the collapse of the <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> Convention will weaken the good will among nations that has kept the continent at the foot of the world a place of peace and scientific cooperation. A voluntary moratorium on mineral exploitation remains in place, and few diplomats said they were worried about a rush to dig and drill in the absence of the convention. To fill the legal void, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have proposed that <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> be declared a `` wilderness park'' where mining would be prohibited and other human activity carefully controlled. This ambitious proposal, which was to be debated in the corridors during the 10-day <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting, has the support of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, Australian diplomats said. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also has voted to not sign the minerals convention. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is shared by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which is heavily dependent on foreign oil imports. These countries say the stringent controls in the mining convention assure the protection of wildlife, habitat and marine resources. `` This agreement establishes environmental principles which are very important,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. Besides, he said, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not a single-interest constituency. There are economic interests who say, ` We are not interested in mining now, but we can not exclude the possibility.' These interests are politically significant.'' <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> said that deciding <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s future `` on the basis of emotions rather than facts is a bad precedent.'' But, environmentalists say, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position may be in flux. They point to a resolution introduced last week by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., to prevent ratification of the minerals accord `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is responding to a shift in American attitudes'' on the environment, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'd say the administration is out of touch.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude toward development in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> may be influenced by the recent oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> that fouled the state's pristine coastline. Nearly 11 million gallons of oil spilled from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> after it ran aground on a reef March 24 shortly after the tanker pulled out of the harbor at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the southern terminal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will change their position on mining in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. But the two countries have their own plans. `` We will go slowly,'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told the French news magazine <ORGANIZATION> L'Express </ORGANIZATION> in August. `` These ideas have to incubate a little while for there to be a meeting of the minds.''

<HEAD>Burmese Students To Be Tried In Thailand</HEAD>

 Two Burmese students who hijacked an aircraft to demand democracy in their military-ruled country will be tried in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and not sent back to their homeland, a senior <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> official said today. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirisunpan </PERSON> told a news conference that while they faced a maximum penalty of death he expected the two students, who hijacked a domestic Burmese flight on Friday, would be dealt with leniently. `` We will not send them back to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> who persuaded the hijackers to give up peacefully after they diverted the plane to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the 83 people they had held hostage were released unharmed after more than 10 hours of negotiations. <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> said the students _ identified as <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ha </PERSON>, 25 _ could not request political asylum in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> or any other country until after legal proceedings against them are completed. The students, who initially threatened to blow up the plane with a homemade explosive, demanded a return of democracy to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and the freeing of all political prisoners. <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> said the Anti-Terrorist Committee he heads was `` very sympathetic'' to the two students but added that `` we ca n't ignore what they have done.'' He said the two have been charged with criminal acts related to hijacking under both Thai law and three international conventions which <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has signed. The deputy prime minster said they would be handed over by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy to police in <LOCATION> Sattahip </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <LOCATION> Sattahip </LOCATION>, located southeast of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, is near a navy-controlled air base to which the hijacked plane was flown. The plane has since returned to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A Burmese student rebel group said today that they had received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for the hijacking and asked the group to support the two student hijackers. The <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said it received the letter on Saturday. The front said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was founded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in April but that but little else was known about it. The Front is the major representative of students who fled the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> interior to fight for democracy from camps along the country's borders. It has denied involvement in the hijacking but expressed sympathy with the hijackers' aims. A massive, pro-democracy uprising in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was brutally crushed in September 1988 following months of demonstrations and violence. A military junta wields martial law in the country today and has in recent months arrested several thousand dissidents, according to Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Rail Strike Reported Despite Ban on Stoppages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defying a nationwide ban on transport strikes, Azerbaijani railroad crews stopped desperately needed supplies from reaching rival <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in the latest episode of a dispute over territory both republics claim. Azerbaijani activist <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON> said, `` Our drivers are striking and demanding guarantees of their safety,'' in response to gunfire and stoning attacks on trains late Saturday in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reported idled on main lines in the southwestern region. There were conflicting reports over how much food, fuel and building supplies managed to reach the Armenian republic. The republics are feuding over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a fertile predominantly Armenian enclave that has been part of Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. Ethnic feuding over the region in the past 19 months has left 117 people dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes and apartments destroyed, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. On Tuesday, the Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on strikes in key sectors such as transportation and energy. The move followed a warning from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that stoppages could ruin the economy and lead to anarchy. Lawmakers also ordered security forces to restore rail traffic between the feuding <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics. Troops moved in to protect the trains, and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media said Friday that the two-month blockade that crippled <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was over. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> denied that train traffic was halted Sunday. `` The trains are running, but the attacks on them are also continuing,'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON> said in an interview from the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported late Sunday that 37 trains were dispatched from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> over the past day and a half, and `` extremist forces are still hindering the normal functioning of the route.'' In the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, five people were wounded in clashes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with dark malice and suppresses their reason,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Airlifts `` are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has a predominantly Armenian population of about 160,000, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Ungathered grape crops rot in the fields, there are armed attacks against villages, and ambulances do n't have enough gasoline, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, a highway bridge on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, was blown up early Saturday, the agency said. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> still faced food and fuel shortages. He said the few shipments making it through to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were sabotaged and contained either damaged materials or cisterns filled with water instead of fuel. `` Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in an interview from the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. `` That the blockade was stopped at all is a myth.'' About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted reconstruction work on Armenian areas destroyed by a massive earthquake in December that left 25,000 dead. Gadzhiev accused Armenians of plotting their own blockades on <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. He said Saturday's bridge explosion in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was aimed at a nearby Azerbaijani village. The power supply to part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> also has been interrupted by unrest in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON> said from the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hopes to recruit spies and lure defectors with advertisements it has placed in a Russian-language newspaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has begun running daily ads in <LOCATION> Novoye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russkoye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slovo </LOCATION>, or New Russian Word, asking readers to tell the bureau what they know about Soviet spies operating here and abroad, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` Replies will be kept in the strictest confidence,'' the ad states. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has received six calls since the first ad ran Friday but would not disclose what the callers said, the Times said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, told the Times the ad is designed to capitalize on the influx of about 150,000 Soviet emigres since 1975. About 50,000 emigres settled in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. The American intelligence community has always presumed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> smuggled in agents along with the emigres, and the newspaper ads are aimed at catching those spies, according to the Times. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials also want to collect information about Soviet criminal gangs that operate in the emigre community, especially in the <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the Times said. The ads, which are costing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> $ 300 a day, are scheduled to run daily for two weeks and then appear intermittently, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> told the paper. The Russian-language newspaper, published in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has a circulation of more than 50,000 nationwide, largely in emigre communities.

 East German authorities tried and sentenced to jail many of the hundreds of protesters arrested during weekend anti-government demonstrations in a half-dozen cities, West German television said today. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> began letting Western tourists back into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after keeping them out since Thursday during ceremonies marking the state's 40th anniversary, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> officials said. On Sunday, riot police used clubs and dogs to attack thousands of demonstrators rallying for democratic reform outside an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> church in a second day of protests against their Communist government's intransigence. The peaceful protesters shouted `` We want freedom'' and `` No violence,'' as security forces broke up a sit-in after a vigil at the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, beating demonstrators and chasing them into side streets. Police seized between 30 and 100 people, according to <ORGANIZATION> Hessische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Several people were injured. The latest arrests came after hundreds were detained in protests Saturday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> and Plauen. Some estimates put the number arrested at more than 1,000 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> alone. `` Many of those arrested have been given summary trials and sentenced to prison terms of up to six months,'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television said today. It did not give a more precise estimate. <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said demonstrations had also occurred in <PERSON> Karl-Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON>. East German officials gave no reports of arrests or injuries. As it marks its 40th anniversary, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is in the throes of the most serious street demonstrations since Soviet tanks and troops put down a workers' revolt in 1953. This time, however, the demonstrators are looking to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a model of liberal reform. On Sunday, West German television showed Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saying that many East Germans have `` strong sympathy'' for his liberalizing of the Soviet political system and economy. He said democratic changes in the Communist world were the main topic of his talks Saturday with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 77-year-old hard-line leader, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Saturday after spending two days in East Berling for anniversary celebrations. Sunday night's violence in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> began when riot police beat protesters as they left the Church, where about 5,000 people had gathered for a vigil. After negotiations between church officials and police, most protesters left, but some joined 2,000 others who were staging a sit-in nearby on Schoenhauser Allee street. Police used clubs and trucks with steel-mesh barriers welded to the front to chase the protesters into side streets, witnesses said. One man who watched the violence from his apartment window said, `` It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocks and Molotov cocktails are going to fly.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency accused Western news media of aiding the weekend protests, calling the demonstrators `` troublemakers.'' Authorities refused to renew the visas of dozens of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists who were in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the anniversary festivities. Reporters were told to leave the city when their visas expired at midnight Sunday. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network on Sunday showed an interview that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> apparently gave Soviet television immediately after his meeting with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. `` After many talks I have the impression that the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s citizens, the veterans, the middle-aged and especially the young, have strong sympathy for our perestroika policy,'' he said referring to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reform program. `` These are fiery fans, there is strong support.'' East Germans are considering `` what to change and improve, not only in the economy and in social respects, but also in the political and societal institutions,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies have made him popular among many East Germans. Protesters chanted his name and called for his support during his visit. The anniversary celebrations were to illustrate the success of Communism in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which despite being a tightly controlled society is in better economic shape than its East bloc partners. Instead, world attention focused on the protests, which were in part stirred by an exodus of about 50,000 disgruntled East Germans through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since Sept. 10, when <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> opened its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Despite the growing unrest and exodus to the West, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> reportedly told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> he would stick to his conservative course. Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheons repeatedly charged demonstrators in the capital Saturday and early Sunday. Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged away the protesters, roughing up Western journalists as well. At least two Western reporters were detained in separate incidents for six hours. Also Sunday, activists demanding reform said they had formed a <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to promote a `` rigorous democratization of state and society.'' The party's charter was signed by 43 people in <LOCATION> Schwante </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The Communist government recently banned a prominent reform group, New Forum. The group says its membership has grown from the original 30 members to more than 11,000.

 While most <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> residents enjoy the turning of the fall colors, people in <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> hold their noses as the ginkgo tree turns rank. The ginkgo dates back 200 million years to the era of dinosaurs. And, residents say, every fall it smells like it. `` It smells just like a baby's dirty pants. Really!'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> McNairn </PERSON>, a member of the Friends of <ORGANIZATION> Dorsch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. `` I smelled it for years.'' Since 1865, a ginkgo has been standing in front of the Dorsch library in this town 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The female tree, which originates from eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, bears an edible fruit whose hull emits a strong odor into the fall air. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s annual Ginkgo Mania festival, which began last week, includes a contest to determine what day the <PERSON> Dorsch </PERSON> tree's leaves will fall.

<HEAD>Four Charged in Probe Linked With Assassination of IRA Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police investigating security leaks arrested 28 members of the army's <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> in raids on their homes and four were charged with unspecified firearms offenses. The soldiers allegedly leaked files identifying <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members some of whom were targeted for assassination by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists, police said. Some of those detained in the raids early Sunday were later released, and it was not clear whether others would be charged. Police said they found security documents, ammunition and weapons in the raids. The four charged with unspecified firearms offenses were to appear in court today. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and consists of soldiers who belong overwhelmingly to the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 180 members of the regiment in its fight to end British rule and unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Members of the regiment and police officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> allegedly colluded with outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> groups by giving them copies of lists of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspects. <PERSON> Loughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON>, 28, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> father of four who was on one of the leaked lists, was assassinated Aug. 25 and two members of the regiment have been charged in his slaying. The killing was claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group, which claimed <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday's arrests came after an inquiry by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a regional police chief brought in from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His probe was triggered by the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> giving security details of <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON> and other persons to the press. A British soldier, brought from his base in <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, has already been charged with leaking information. Early today, a man was killed by a gunman who pulled up alongside him in a car and shot him at point-blank range, police said. The man, whose name was released, was shot in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. The victim had no connection with the security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman on condition of anonymity. In another development, police said they foiled a planned breakout of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> prisoners from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Crumlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> jail on Saturday night. They said four pounds of plastic explosives were found at the prison and a 500-pound bomb was defused on a construction site outside the facility. Rioting in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Saturday night appeared designed to keep officers busy while the escape proceeded, police said. They said seven stolen cars were left at the prison with ignition keys inside. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curren </PERSON>, a councilman for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, was shot and wounded by unidentified gunmen Sunday night in <LOCATION> Lurgan </LOCATION>, 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Earlier Sunday, police superintendent <PERSON> Alwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 51, was killed by a bomb when he started his car in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility. The killings brought the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> death toll since the first killings in 1969 to 2,759, according to police count. The dead include 264 police officers, 597 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> and 1,899 civilians.

<HEAD>Fiery Crash 15th This Year For Indian Air Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An air force jet plunged to earth and exploded during an air show after the pilot apparently misjudged his altitude and tried an extra maneuver. The flier was killed and dozens of spectators were injured fleeing the fiery wreckage. The crash Sunday was the 15th this year for the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> air force, which has the world's highest accident rate, defense statistics show. The Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed at Indian Air Force Day celebrations. The pilot, <PERSON> Ramesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, the 39-year-old commander of the Mirage squadron, was killed instantly. Dozens of panicked spectators suffered sprained ankles, bruises or broken bones while running toward or away from the giant fireball. Four people were hospitalized in serious condition with burns over 50 percent of their bodies, military officials said. The silver delta-winged aircraft was completing a stunt known as a `` Vertical Charlie,'' the finale of a 20-minute display of the air force's supersonic fighters, transport and training aircraft. Air Marshal <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suri </PERSON>, vice chief of the air staff, said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> was only scheduled to perform three rolls but instead attempted a fourth. Unable to complete the roll and pull out of its rapid descent, the plane hurtled to the ground as 2,000 military and civilian dignitaries and other guests attending the 57th anniversary watched in horror, only 300 yards away. The plane slammed into the ground and exploded, igniting a huge fireball as the wreckage bounced through fuel tanks on the ground. Chunks of burning debris hit several vehicles in the parking lot of the military section of <LOCATION> Palam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suri </PERSON> said the pilot may have miscalculated his height because the sky was hazy. When <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> started to pull up, the plane was about 18 feet from the ground, they said. In 1987-88 alone, officials reported 46 crashes of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> air force jets, most involving the Soviet-made MiG-21 or MiG-27. Defense officials said that averages 2.4 crashes per 10,000 flying hours. Neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had a 1.2 average, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 0.8 and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 0.65 in the same period, the statistics showed. The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 mph hour at an altitude of 65,600 feet.

 Americans <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize in medicine today for their discovery of a family of genes that has helped scientists understand how cancer develops. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, 49, work in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I was stunned,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, who lives in Belvedere, outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said he was sleeping when he heard the news on the radio. `` I did n't know if it was a false alarm or they got my name confused, not having talked to anyone directly,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` As we say in science, I needed confirmation of the information.'' The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest medical university, cited the researchers `` for their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes.'' Their 1976 work on oncogenes, which control the division and growth of cells, helped understand how malignant tumors develop, the citation said. The discovery also `` widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said. Oncogenic virus was discovered as early as 1916, although it was not known as such until nearly 50 years later. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> `` published the remarkable conclusion that the oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene but instead was a normal cellular gene, which the virus had acquired during replication in the host cell and thereafter carried along,'' the citation said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichard </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said, `` They have clarified how cancer genes work.'' `` The great importance of the discovery is that we have a completely different view on how cancer can originate, and through that we hope to be able to use this practically later on,'' he said. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> called the scientists' work a `` cornerstone in understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer.'' `` The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its origins in genes that normally do us some good. But after they become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer.'' He and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> will share a $ 469,000 cash prize. It was the third time the Nobel Prize has been awarded for research in connection with this field of research. <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rous </PERSON> was first given the prize after his 1916 discovery of a tumor-inducing virus, which was then called the Rous virus. In 1975, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulbecco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Temin </PERSON> were awarded the prize for discovering the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cells. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and Vermus were added to a long list of Americans who have dominated the medicine prize over the last 20 years. They were the 30th and 31st <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winners since 1969, compared with 19 laureates from all other countries combined. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> on Feb. 22, 1936, studied at <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and worked in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He spent time in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before moving to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where he was born Dec. 18, 1939. He studied at <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and earned his masters degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1962, the same year <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> earned his medical degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> received a doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1966. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> also worked at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> as a clinical associate before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. The assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> never announces a list of candidates for the prize, but officials say about 250 scientists are considered each year. Many are nominated repeatedly. The medicine prize was the first of four Nobel awards being announced this week. All are worth 3 million Swedish kronor, or about $ 469,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> will disclose the economics prize winner Wednesday, and the laureates for chemistry and physics Thursday. The date for the literature prize has not been announced. The Nobel Peace Prize was given Thursday to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the exiled spiritual and political leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, for his non-violent struggle against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rule of his Himalayan country. Last year's medicine prize went to Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON>. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and to Americans <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>. They were cited for developing principles leading to new drugs that have been applied against leukemia, AIDS, heart disease and other lethal illnesses. The prizes were first awarded in 1901 from the estate of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the inventor of dynamite.

<TEXT>
 The following is the text of the citation from the Nobel Assembly announcing the winners of the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. The Nobel Assembly at the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1989 jointly to <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> for their discovery of `` The Cellular Origin of Retroviral Oncogenes.'' The discovery awarded with this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine concerns the normal growth and division of cells. Disturbances in one or some of these so-called oncogenes can lead to transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell and result in cancer. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> used an oncogenic retrovirus to identify the growth-controlling oncogenes in normal cells. In 1976 they published the remarkable conclusion that the oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene but instead was a normal cellular gene, which the virus had acquired during replication in the host cell and thereafter carried along. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>' discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes has had an extensive influence on the development of our knowledge about mechanisms for tumor developement. Until now more than 40 different oncogenes have been demonstrated. The discovery has also widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> began a visit to the world's largest Moslem country today and said <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s tiny <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority seeks unity with all Indonesians. The pope's remarks came amid controversy over a scheduled stop in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1976. The pope arrived after a weekend visit to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The pontiff knelt and kissed the tarmac, wet from a tropical rainstorm, in the sticky 90 degree heat. Soldiers lined the 10-mile motorcade route from the military airport to the palm tree-ringed presidential palace, where <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s pro-Western president, <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, greeted the pontiff. There have been several reported threats on the life of the pope from Moslem extremist groups. In a country made up of 13,766 islands and about 200 ethnic and religious groups, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> governments have stressed the need to maintain unity. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> immediately sought to make clear that his visit posed no threat to unity in this nation of 5 million Catholics and 157 million Moslems. During a Mass at a sports stadium, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said he came as `` a friend of every <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> in our common humanity and our common concern for the development and peace of the world in which we live.'' He expressed his `` cordial esteem'' to `` our Moslem brothers and sisters, who are so numerous in this country.'' `` I extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our common belief in the one God, our creator and merciful lord,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, speaking in English. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Catholic Indonesians were deeply proud of their country. `` We must be fully <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and fully <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` These words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of the nation.'' The stop in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, scheduled for Thursday, has drawn protests from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has said the visit does not imply <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> recognition of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s annexation of the territory. He said last week that skipping the territory would be an `` offense'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s Catholics, nearly 80 percent of the island's 690,000 people. The 69-year-old pontiff is to spend five days in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and visit four cities in addition to the capital. During his two-day visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, he encouraged people to work toward unifying the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was the first stop on the pope's 10-day Asian tour. He also is to visit the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Oct. 16.

 Police said today that two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials kidnapped last week are being held by radical Palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group has denied taking part in the kidnappings. `` We have established that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s men carried out the abduction. We believe the hostages are held in a base east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. He said the base was `` between the villages of <LOCATION> Majdalyoun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bkosta </LOCATION>,'' three miles east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The area is controlled exclusively by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group,'' the spokesman said. Masked gunmen grabbed the two Swiss men, <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Christen </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Erriquez </PERSON>, 23, in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on Friday, bundled them into the trunk of a car and drove off toward the <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Hilweh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southeastern outskirts. The police spokesman said the kidnappers drove through <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON> to their base east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON> is controlled by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is at odds with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidals </PERSON>' breakaway faction. Asked whether police would attempt to rescue the hostages, the spokesman said: `` We do n't have the necessary force to do that. We have investigators, but not a strike force.'' Government and police authority power been severely eroded by 14 years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, leaving power largely in the hands of militias. Asked about <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s reported involvement in the abductions, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidler </PERSON>, chief delegate of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` We have no new information about our missing colleagues.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Saturday condemning the abductions and offering to help free the men, but police and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have said they do not take the denial seriously. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> is the nom de guerre of <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, who broke away from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction in 1973. His faction has been blamed for a score of terrorist attacks, including the December 1985 attacks on the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports. Friday's kidnapping prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to close its orthopedic center in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, which provided artificial limbs for civil war and car bomb victims. About 50 amputees in wheelchairs and on crutches, all of them patients at the center, demonstrated outside the building Sunday, condemning the abductions and demanding the release of Christen and Erriquez. `` We had to close it because our two abducted comrades were the backbone of the clinic's operations,'' <PERSON> Sidler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen last week accused <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group of the kidnappings, linking them to a Shiite Moslem militant, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, who is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, 22, is reputed to be a member of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 18 hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Eight of the hostages are Americans. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group, which is bankrolled by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, has a record of cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. After <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s capital April 15, 1986, the bodies of three Western hostages were found two days later near a highway in the central Lebanese mountains east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers said at the time that the three victims, who had been held by pro-Iranian militants loyal to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, were turned over to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group to mete out vengeance for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first time has refused to accept 70 Chinese illegal immigrants being returned from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said Monday. The immigrants were scheduled to be repatriated to the neighboring <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> on Sunday, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials refused to accept them at the border checkpoint, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 French oceanographer <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, famed for his TV documentaries, sank half of a `` Today'' discussion on <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> issues today by refusing to yield his seat to an American guest awaiting his turn on the show. The incident occurred at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s facilities in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Delegates of 39 nations are meeting in that city to discuss an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> treaty. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> is part of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> delegation, which wants the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> made into a world park. Before his appearance, <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, who opposes any <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> development, refused to discuss the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> issue on `` Today'' with <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the conference, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation favors regulated development of the region. However, she said, <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> had told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> officials that he would leave after his interview so that <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, awaiting his turn in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> studio, could be interviewed about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. But after `` Today'' news anchor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> concluded her interview of more than two minutes with <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, `` he would n't leave,'' thus blocking <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>'s scheduled appearance, <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON> said Viewers did n't see <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> staying put. Nor did they see <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> awaiting his turn. `` We're having a little difficulty getting Mr. <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> hooked up there in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> told viewers as the off-camera problem, of which she also seemed unaware, began across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. After a few seconds, she reported that `` we are having some difficulty with our feed there in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and we will not be able to talk with Mr. <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' side.'' `` Our apologies to him and our apologies to you for not being able to give you the other side of that discussion. Our thanks, though, to Capt. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.'' Immediately after a station break, though, <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> was back on the air, offering `` a little explanation as to how strong the feelings run on this <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> issue. Capt. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> refused to move over so that we could talk to Mr. <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, who was sitting right there, waiting.'' At that point, co-anchor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> smiled and said, `` <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>'s feelings run strong, too.'' <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> did n't say if <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> gave an explanation for his action. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> `` never said why he was n't leaving,'' Hubble said later.

 Police are playing down speculation that a serial killer is stalking <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s prostitutes, but the slayings of six women in a little more than two months have spread fear on the streets. `` We're all a little scared,'' said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who said she had worked <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s streets for 11 years, `` but not scared enough'cause we're still out here.'' Police Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said it was too early to talk about a serial killer, pointing out that about 10 prostitutes are killed in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> each year. Still, he admits that six deaths in such a short time is unusual, and the possibility of a single killer is n't being ruled out. Six young women with police records for prostitution and drugs have been killed, although there has been no clear pattern to the deaths. One victim was hanged, two were beaten and three were shot. Three were black, three white. Some of the bodies were naked, some clothed. The naked body of the latest victim, 23-year-old <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, was found hanging from a walnut tree in a neighborhood park Thursday. Police are investigating the Sept. 20 death of a woman in <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Candlestick Park, to determine if it is connected to the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> slayings, said <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> homicide investigator. The victim was a suspected prostitute, he said. One prostitute said she had warned two of the victims about a man who attacked her on Aug. 31. One of the women died Sept. 20, and the other died five days later, about two blocks apart. The woman, who would not give her name, said she had been raped and robbed by a customer who claimed he `` hated whores and that all women are whores.''

<HEAD>Ceausescu Tours Bucharest Markets, Promises Better Food Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has toured poorly stocked markets in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and promised better food supplies, a news agency reported Monday. <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, whose unexpected visit of food outlets in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s capital on Sunday came just a day after returning from celebrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, announced improvements in government-sponsored food programs. There has been growing criticism of food shortages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, as well as recent unofficial calls for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to step down. `` The programs of good supply to the population should be extended and developed,'' the report said, without elaborating. Under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s centralized economy, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> _ once the breadbasket of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ has faced rationing of staples such as meat, flour, cooking oil and bread, while fresh vegetables and fruit have been hard to find even in spring and summer. Sugar has been rationed to 2.2 pounds per person per month and cooking oil to one quart per person a month. Last month, the government announced that starting Oct. 1, oil and sugar supplies would be augmented by 20 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Most of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s farmland is owned by state collective farms and only 10 percent is tilled privately in small plots or gardens around farmers' houses. `` The visit and the analysis that followed disclosed the steadfast preoccupation of the ... leadeship with the ... rhythmic supply of ... markets ... to the planned extent and at an appropriate level of quality,'' Agerpres said. Delegates to a <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress scheduled for next month have been urged recently to denounce <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> for incompetence and oust him as party leader. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, was unanimously proposed by the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the summer to be re-elected at the Nov. 20-25 congress Addressing a party meeting of economic experts last week, he made clear that under his hard-line rule, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> would never adopt economic and political reforms under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In an unusually harsh criticism, the government daily <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Libera blamed transportation problems, bad organization and careless administration for the food shortages. `` A large crowd was waiting in line at the vegetables counter of Titan market, although nothing was on sale,'' the newspaper said. Asked about the absence of fresh vegetables, market officials said `` only 19 metric tons of potatoes were delivered out of the planned 25 tons, while deliveries of carrots, eggplants and greens remained only on paper.'' `` Only once we received pears -LRB- from state-owned farms -RRB- this summer,'' the officials told <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libera </LOCATION>. `` After you tour 10-15 markets you can conclude that ... distribution is wrongly done,'' it said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet bound from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> made an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, after one of its four engines failed early today, airline spokesmen said. Flight 156, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, landed at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, about 3:20 a.m. EDT. No one was injured, but hotels were unavailable and all but two of the 203 passengers spent the night at the terminal or aboard the airplane. Those two chartered a private jet, while the others continued their trip aboard a substitute 747 that left Gander at 10:30 a.m., said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. The original flight, with a crew of 17, left <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> about 9:50 p.m. Sunday. Near Gander `` they experienced an engine vibration and a stall and the No. 1 engine was shut down,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. While a 747 can fly on three of its four engines, normal procedure in such cases is to land at the nearest airport. The pilot declared `` a routine, precautionary emergency'' to gain priority to land at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> said. The plane descended from about 33,000 feet in what <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> called `` a deliberate descent'' but not a disruptive one. The plane landed safely and passengers departed by portable stairs, he said.

<TEXT>
 The failed Panamanian coup last week is forcing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers to reexamine the restraint that has kept the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from intervening more forcefully in smaller nations. For 15 years, concern about becoming bogged down in `` another <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' has influenced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders' decisions about intervention. And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to openly assist the attempted coup against Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> showed he was not prepared to risk <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lives and prestige in a military operation that had neither clear public support nor a clear chance of success. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, armed anti-Communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other nations where leftist governments had come to power following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. While members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have welcomed diminished <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration support for Nicaraguan guerrillas, the confused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> brought calls from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ from both Democrats and Republicans _ for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be bolder. `` Failure is the father of about 100 hawks on Capitol Hill now. Suddenly, everyone is fluttering around the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, saying, ` let's use military force,''' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter. `` I find it ironic that many of the same people who have imposed some restrictions on the administration by deed or word, suddenly now want to use <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> force,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` I think it is an opportunity for all of us to finally lay it out: Do the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by virtue of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, really support the use of force to take out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> either overtly or covertly? We've got to know that,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Another Republican, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, however, called the administration's handling of the coup `` an incredible stain on us'' and said White House statements were a `` weak-kneed explanation for failure.'' And Democratic Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't think it's right for this country, for a great country, to go out and encourage people to take action, put their lives on the line, to imply by encouraging them to take that action that we're going to help them, and not be there.'' A poll released by <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend showed support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach. While 60 percent of those polled thought it `` very important ... to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> give up power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' 45 percent said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement was `` just about right.'' Thirty percent said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> played `` not enough'' of a role in the coup attempt and 9 percent said `` too much.'' The poll of 750 people, conducted last Thursday and Friday, had a 4 percent margin of error. The issue is broader than whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should use force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, say administration officials as well as lawmakers who criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervene militarily in other nations after the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> withdrew its army from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and signaled that it would not block democratic moves under way in such Soviet bloc countries as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>? Or, as formulated by one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most outspoken critics, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., what would <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies think if the administration had used troops from American military bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` International considerations come into play here. We ca n't have ... tunnel vision on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We can not ignore the repercussions,'' of using a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base for aiding or launching a coup, said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, referring to lease renewal negotiations for two key American military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` What we do in countries where we have bases has a direct bearing'' on such negotiations, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said last week. The disclosure on Sunday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides had been laying plans for covert action to grab <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during the coup clouded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. The administration, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, `` has not ruled out the use of military force'' against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in a coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would set off alarm bells all over <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including among American allies in the war on drugs, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Face the Nation.'' `` If you are actively involved and using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force to topple governments of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you're going to have a lot of trouble getting the Colombians and Peruvians and Bolivians and others to agree to have military training teams, for example,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` The way that you use the military effectively in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to help the Latin Americans help themselves, not use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to topple Latin American governments.''

 Despite a string of record profits, hundreds of commercial banks and the government insurance fund that guarantees their deposits are far less healthy than they seem, analysts say. The warnings are making members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nervous just two months after they enacted a $ 50 billion, three-year bailout of the savings and loan industry. Legislators remember all too well the reassurances they heard from regulators and industry executives while the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L business was crumbling, and how quickly hints of trouble mushroomed into the most dire financial crisis since the Depression. Two well-known banking economists, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank, and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumbaugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, report that commercial banks, though better off as a whole than S & amp; Ls, may be heading for trouble themselves. <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week, warned that about two-thirds of the reserves in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s bank fund will be needed for banks that are weak or already insolvent. At the end of June, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s bank reserves totaled $ 14.5 billion. But <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brumbaugh </PERSON> say their analysis of bank data through March shows that $ 9.5 billion of that is needed to cover losses at banks that are insolvent or close to it, leaving only a thin $ 5 billion layer of protection before taxpayers would be called on to bail out the fund. A post-Depression record of 221 banks failed last year. So far this year, 167 have closed or required government assistance to stay open _ 116 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> says he expects failures for all of 1989 to be slightly below last year and to decline further in 1990. However, a study by analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, casts doubt o that. He said that 443 banks of 13,000 nationwide have been losing money consistently from 1987 through the first quarter of this year. `` In spite of the high reported earnings of the banking industry -LRB- overall -RRB-, the picture is not as rosy as it seems,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` If present earnings trends for these -LRB- 443 -RRB- banks continue, this group will run out of capital by late 1990 or early 1991.'' The banking industry disputes its critics. `` Skeptics make a living peddling a different tune,'' <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> banker C.G. <PERSON> Holthus </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` We think they're exaggerating the problem. By many measures, commercial banks, unlike savings and loans, are flourishing. Banks earned a record six-month profit of $ 14.3 billion in the first half of 1989, on top of the record annual profit of $ 25.1 billion last year. And their three most pressing problems have all eased: _ The nation's largest banks have added to their loss reserves, putting them in a better position to withstand a deterioration of shaky Third World debtor nations to repay the banks' loans _ The string of <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> bank failures has subsided with the recovery of the farm economy _ The economies of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other oil-producing states, where most of the failures are concentrated now, appear to have bottomed out Moreover, the savings and loan bailout bill passed this summer nearly doubles the insurance premium paid by banks. That will provide an added $ 1.5 billion a year to help the fund recover from its first-ever loss in 1988. `` Simply put, the condition of commercial banks is not a thrift crisis in sheep's clothing,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an analyst who expresses more optimism than some of his colleagues. Replied Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., `` I'm not sure I'm reassured ... It's a little bit like saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is better off than <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., has been voicing similar worries and last week asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing arm, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, to conduct a comprehensive study of the deposit insurance fund and the condition of banking `` Although federal regulators paint a rosy picture of the industry, certain industry experts cast doubt on this assessment. I am deeply troubled over the concerns raised by these experts,'' he said in a letter requesting the study. The analysts identify two areas as the likely causes of the next banking crisis: large banks' growing involvement in financing leveraged corporate buyouts and community banks' decision to follow thrifts into real estate lending. Bank real estate loans have soared 75 percent from $ 364 billion in 1984 to $ 636 billion in 1988, according to consultant <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Softening property values in northeastern states are particularly ominous. `` Real estate lending has become the Achilles heel of banking,'' he said. `` ... Some of the growth unfortunately financed speculative excesses which will take time to absorb.''

 Hundreds of students returned to campus Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> reopened after being closed for six months, its longest shutdown since the sectarian civil war began 14 years ago. `` The whole family's back,'' said <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawlawi </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION>, the alma mater of the Arab world's elite and once the most admired university in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The cafeteria was packed with students, who hugged each other and renewed friendships. Others jammed the campus post office, checking their accumulated mail. <PERSON> Mawlawi </PERSON> said the campus was hit several times by artillery fire, causing `` extensive damage ... that has now been repaired.'' `` Everything's in place. The faculty and students are here,'' he said. Syrian troops and Lebanese police in red berets checked student ID cards at the three gates of the tree-lined campus overlooking the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s life is throbbing again now that the university has reopened,'' said a policeman who strolled through the campus. It was not known how many of the 5,000 students returned on Monday. <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheib </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem architecture student, said: `` I'm very happy to be back. Let's hope it'll last.'' Many students and other residents of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> share her doubts about the durability of a cease-fire that began Sept. 22. The truce, arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, stopped an artillery war that began March 8 between the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and a Moslem alliance led by Syrian soldiers. More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded in the artillery battles, among the most savage of the civil war. Closure of the university, founded 123 years ago by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> missionary <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, made it impossible for students to take examinations. `` I hope this semester wo n't be interrupted, because I have to begin my master's degree next semester,'' said <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahtan </PERSON>, 27, an agricultural student. Ms. <PERSON> Khatan </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, has endured many interruptions in her education because of the war, in which more than 150,000 Lebanese have been killed. `` I hope I'll graduate this time,'' she said. `` Let's hope this cease-fire's genuine.'' <PERSON> Marleen </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavernier </PERSON>, a 29-year-old Belgian doctor studying public health, said: `` I've been waiting for this day. I only need two more months to finish my master's.'' The reopening coincided with resumption of classes at scores of schools that were forced to close because of the shelling. Education officials estimated 800,000 children university students and returned to school Monday. American Univerersity of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has produced at least three <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> presidents, 10 prime ministers, more than 100 Cabinet ministers and ambassadors, and several guerrilla leaders. It is chartered under the laws of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The 400-bed university hospital, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest, stayed open through the fighting.

<HEAD>Aquino Refuses Compromise on Marcos Burial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Monday she would not compromise her refusal to let <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, her exiled predecessor, be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the former president's widow, as suggesting terms be negotiated for allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be buried in <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, his home province <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Sept. 28 in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> at age 72. Two senators urged <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> to reveal details of an alleged plot to kill Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in connection with a coup by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> forces. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since a civilian-military uprising drove him from the country on Feb. 26, 1986, after 20 years in office. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> cited fears of civil unrest in refusing to allow the return of the body or <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> relatives. In a statement Monday, she said: `` The position against the return of the remains of former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is based on considerations of national interest and security, so it can not be the subject of compromise.'' Cabinet officials said last week the ban was based in part on intelligence reports of a plot to assassinate Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The government has not released details, but congressmen briefed on the contents have warned of a serious threat to stability if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body is returned Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> should reveal the reports public because of their seriousness. Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the former defense minister and an opposition senator, endorsed <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>'s request, to which the government did not respond. <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspaper, quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as suggesting discussions about the burial could begin when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November. `` I have always been open to this,'' she was quoted as saying. `` We have initiated it and we will not tire to initiate such a move because of our obsession with what is right.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has asked the government to respond by Friday to a petition by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters asking that the ban on the body's return be nullified. An 8-7 court ruling last month found <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be a security threat, but loyalists hope the justices will reconsider now that the former president is dead. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told a business group Monday forgiving the Marcoses would undermine public faith in morality. `` The spirit of reconciliation has been extended to the blind forgiveness of those who fronted for the dicatorship and who have yet to make restitution to the nation,'' she declared. `` My critical attitude toward this development has been called vindictiveness. ... What worries me about this is not so much that the guilty are escaping censure, but that the millions of innocent Filipinos will lose faith in the value of morals.'' Several <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers reported from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> was trying to mediate between the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family and the government. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, who left for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on Friday, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987 as an opposition member, but later joined the governing coalition. He is a former actor and served as mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> presidency.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Set to Hear White Rape Convict's Complaint of Jury
Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A white man's claim that a lack of black jurors denied him a fair trial on charges including rape is among the cases the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to consider this week. In arguments scheduled Wednesday before the court, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s lawyers plan to argue that white defendants should be accorded the same constitutional right granted to blacks to challenge racial bias during jury selection. Prosecutors say race was not an issue and contend that <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s case could lead to unworkable quotas for juries An all-white jury in the suburban <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> convicted <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> in 1981 on charges of rape, sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery in the abduction of a 17-year-old girl and her boyfriend. The victims were driving home from a party when their car had a flat tire. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> offered them a ride, then pulled a knife, threatened the girl and ordered the boyfriend out of the car, according to court documents. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> then drove to a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> apartment complex, raped the girl several times and took about $ 60 before fleeing, the documents show. He was arrested later that morning and tried by a jury selected from a pool of about 40 people, two of whom were black. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s conviction was overturned on other grounds by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but reinstated later by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. His appeal puts the spotlight on a legal tradition that allows lawyers to reject a certain number of potential jurors without giving a reason, using what are called peremptory challenges. In <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s case, prosecutors dimissed the two blacks and eight other people without a reason, but said race was not an issue. Prosecutors are barred from using peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from juries for racial reasons under a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. But the high court has held that only minorities have a right to challenge racial bias during jury selection. `` White defendants have no comparable weapon to fight racial bigotry,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, wrote in arguments filed with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` There can be no image of a fair jury in the eyes of the community if the process of selecting it sanctions discrimination.'' <PERSON> Inge </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryklund </PERSON>, supervisor of criminal appeals for the state's attorney's office, contends that <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s lawyers are trying to twist the constitutional right to an impartial jury into a mandate that all juries be representative of communities from which they are selected That would be `` unsound, unworkable and unnecessary,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fryklund </PERSON> argues.

<HEAD>Government Begins Telephone Switchover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is switching to a new long-distance telephone network designed to provide 1.3 million federal workers with state-of-the-art voice, data and video communications. The move, which officials say will save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, comes after five years of study, wrangling and complaints by losing bidders. The changeover began during the long Columbus Day weekend at 31 government buildings nationwide. Ultimately, more than 1,300 locations in 90 federal agencies will be tied to the network when it is fully installed in mid-1990. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is overseeing the mammoth switchover with the two prime contractors that won a fierce bidding war for the project, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Known as FTS2000, for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2000 </ORGANIZATION>, the contract may be worth as much as $ 25 billion over 10 years to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> estimates FTS2000 will save taxpayers between $ 15 million and $ 20 million a month for regular telephone service _ or as much as half of the government's $ 400 million annual phone bill. `` The government's phone bill is going to be going down substantially, beginning this weekend,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> deputy commissioner for telecommunications services, said in a recent interview. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T says a five-minute call between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> will cost about 70 cents under FTS2000, compared with $ 1.40 on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's regular long-distance service or $ 1.35 on the government's existing network. FTS2000 replaces a phone system that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T installed in 1963. The old network provided only voice commmunications and low-speed data transmission. When FTS2000 is fully in place, federal employees will be able to communicate with new speed and efficiency over crystal-clear, digital fiber-optic phone lines that transmit information on beams of laser light. AT & amp; T and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> are banking on federal agencies buying additional services such as videoconferencing, high-speed facsimile service or systems to link large numbers of computers. FTS2000 is a 10-year, fixed-rate contract that gives the government special low rates to use Sprint's existing public network and new AT & amp; T lines essentially dedicated to FTS2000, <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said. Under the contract, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began considering in 1984 and <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> awarded in December, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will serve 60 percent of federal government and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> 40 percent. The two companies will re-bid for 40 percent of the other's share of the contract during the fourth and seventh years of the agreement. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 2 long-distance company behind <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, lost the bidding and has battled in court and at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the contract. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> claimed that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's FTS2000 prices discriminated against <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s regular customers and that the prices were below <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's costs The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s claims. The new system will make it easier for the government to protect secrets by using fiber-optic cable, which are buried in the ground. Because they do n't use electromagnetic signals, they ca n't be `` tapped'' by normal means.

<HEAD>Museum Reveals Van Gogh Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell two <ORGANIZATION> Picassos </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Monet </ORGANIZATION>, a Renoir and three other paintings from its permanent collection to get <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s portrait of the postman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The portrait, painted in 1888-89, arrived at the museum from a bank vault in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> on July 31. Now, details of the deal that brought it here have been made public. For much of this century, the painting was in the <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> collection in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. It was bought in 1987 by the most recent owners and placed in the bank vault. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, estimated recently that `` Roulin'' would be worth roughly the same at auction as <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises,'' which brought $ 53.9 million in 1987. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Varnedoe </PERSON>, director of painting and sculpture at the Modern, told the Times the museum got `` Roulin'' for substantially less than that because the unidentified owners wanted it to hang in a museum. Still, he said, the price was `` not a raging fire-sale bargain.'' At first, <PERSON> Varnedoe </PERSON> said, museum officials did n't think they could afford the van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>. But `` because of changes in the art market, pictures we had available were worth more than we had thought they were worth, and so it now seemed possible.'' In August, the museum, in exchange for `` <LOCATION> Roulin </LOCATION>,'' gave four paintings and an undisclosed amount of cash to Swiss dealers <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyeler </PERSON>, who represented the owners. The dealers received a <ORGANIZATION> Monet </ORGANIZATION> titled `` Corona -LRB- Water Lilies -RRB-,'' from around 1920; <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s `` Reclining Nude,'' 1902; <PERSON> Wassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandinsky </PERSON>'s `` Autumn Landscape, <PERSON> Murnau </PERSON>,'' 1908; and <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Striped Bodice,'' September 1943 To reimburse the Modern for the cash it paid _ and, <PERSON> Varnedoe </PERSON> hopes, provide some extra profits, as well _ three other paintings will be sold at auction on Nov. 15 at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They are <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirico </PERSON>'s `` Evangelical Still Life,'' 1916, which has a presale estimate of $ 2 million to $ 3 million; <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondrian </PERSON>'s `` Blue Facade -LRB- Composition 9 -RRB-,'' 1913-14, estimated at $ 3 million to $ 4 million; and <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Studio in a Painted Frame,'' April 1956, estimated at $ 2 million to $ 3 million. The donors of the works granted permission to sell them. <PERSON> Varnedoe </PERSON> said the paintings that were relinquished had mostly languished in storage for years and were not considered crucial representations of the collection. Even so, he said, the <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> merited a considerable sacrifice. `` We feel <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s portraits are the starting point for a whole vein of 20th-century art,'' said <PERSON> Varnedoe </PERSON>. `` They had influence on <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON> and many others, the whole concept of revealing a personality not by appearance but color had a profound influence, and we were not telling this part of the story of modern art without the portrait. It was a missing chapter.''

<TEXT>
 The nation's top educator has announced the beginning of a nationwide study of American Indian schooling that he hopes will help change decades of disappointing academic performance. `` You may say, ` We've been studying this problem for 200 years. Why another study?''' Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said Sunday. `` But you have to start thinking about what we do n't know. Just by calling attention to it, hopefully, we can bring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to focus on this problem. `` With luck, maybe, by the turn of the century, we'll start turning the corner.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> spoke at the kickoff meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 21st annual conference, scheduled through Thursday. About 1,400 American Indian educators from across the nation are attending. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the study is vital because the nation has no comprehensive statistics on American Indian school achievement. But what is known is enough to suggest that a need for extra attention, he said. He noted a 90 percent unemployment rate on some Indian reservations and a school dropout rate double the national average of 25 percent. He said 75 percent of the American Indian students who make it to college fail to finish. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> titled the study `` Indian Nations at Risk,'' borrowing from the 1983 `` A Nation at Risk'' report on the country's ailing public education system.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said Monday the Western allies must use aid to support political change in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which he called test cases of the alliance's strategy `` The windows have been opened in the closed societies of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the allies do not intend to let them slam shut again,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a consultative organization of legislators from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. He said the flight of 50,000 East Germans to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the decision to give <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a new name and platform, strikes by Soviet miners and the `` joy of the Poles as they greet their first non-Communist prime minister in 40 years'' demonstrate that the peoples of the East have not become accustomed to their political leadership. `` Even if the alliance does not have responsibility for specific aid programs, only <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> can harmonize and coordinate the efforts of the member nations as a whole on these herculean tasks; only <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> brings the combined resources of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to bear on them,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. He said the aid efforts should concentrate on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> because they are taking steps to move closer to democracy and give reform a chance. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are the two test cases,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. `` If reform fails, the lessons will not be lost on the hardliners in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But if reform succeeds, that success will generate irresistible presures for similar change throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should use its limited influence to support change by backing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and others in their reforms promoting more openness, pluralism, human rights and human contact. `` The postwar period has come to an end. We are seeing the profound transformation of the European political and security structure. This offers us opportunites which we should and will not miss,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. But he cautioned the Western allies against making unilateral moves that he said weaken the alliance. `` I will not hide my concern at a tendency that I observe today in most of our member nations which are starting to unilaterally reduce their defense efforts,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. `` It is wrong and it's dangerous.'' The Soviet response to allied proposals at the conventional arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> has been encouraging, he said, but the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> retains an overwhelming superiority in conventional arms. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must base its security on Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact potential, not on announced intentions, said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>.

 Jury selection began Monday for the trial of the first of a series of lawsuits filed by former patients who allege they were victims of sexual abuse and battery at camps for troubled children. The first lawsuit, with five plaintiffs, is being heard in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where more than 100 potential jurors were given questionnaires to fill out Monday. Attorneys estimate the trial could take a month or longer.

The lawsuits name a total of 31 defendants. The non-profit Anneewakee program, which provides long-term care and wilderness-based therapy for teen-agers with psychological problems, has treated hundreds of patients since it was founded 27 years ago. Allegations of abuse of patients surfaced in 1986.

<HEAD>China Acknowledges Worsening Drug Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police acknowledged Monday that farmers have been found growing opium poppies in the southwestern border areas, and that drug addiction has become a problem in the region. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wen </PERSON>, director of criminal investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not know the number of addicts, and all poppy crops found have been eradicated. Both problems were byproducts of a growing transit trade in drugs from southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, through southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at the end of a five-day conference on drug law enforcement in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, organized by <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting, closed to reporters, was `` an important conference of practical significance,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. He said the 79 delegates from 32 countries and regions adopted a 10-point resolution calling on their governments to make anti-drug efforts a top priority and strengthen international cooperation, including financial assistance for underdeveloped countries fighting drug trafficking. They also called on <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> to study the possiblity of setting up a drug law enforcement training center in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s drug problem remains relatively small. But <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongyuan </PERSON>, deputy director of criminal investigation, said the number of drug trafficking cases discovered in 1988 reached 268, up from just 56 the year before. He said police seized 525 pounds of opium in 1988, nearly double the 1987 amount, and 365 pounds of heroin, nearly four times the 1987 amount. Partial figures for 1989 showed continued increase, he said. `` After eliminating drugs for 30 years, many people -LRB- in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- are not prepared and are not paying enough attention _ including police and customs officials,'' he said. `` They can not recognize heroin and opium.'' Opium addiction was one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most serious social problems in the early part of the century. After taking power in 1949, the Communists executed drug traffickers and `` re-educated'' users. For decades the government said drug abuse had been wiped out. Yuan blamed its re-emergence on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s increased foreign contacts since 1978, and especially the relaxed policy on allowing <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents to enter the mainland. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have been convicted in several drug smuggling cases in recent years. One was executed in February after being convicted of recruiting three mainland Chinese in a smuggling scheme. Opium and heroin are brought into southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, and on to <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for sale to the West. Most of the conference participants were from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The only Western countries to attend were <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who meets with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next week, said Monday he hopes for stronger ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he scolded dissidents for their anti-American attitude. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said anti-American acts such as flag-burnings and violent protests have contributed to anti-Korean sentiments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he urged `` the small number of extreme radicals to change their attitude.'' `` I have reports that American feelings inside and outside the government towards our country are worsening as some -LRB- South Korean -RRB- forces have shown fierce anti-American sentiments and also committed violent acts,'' he said in a weekly nationwide radio address. Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority, have staged demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radicals allege <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a puppet of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and have called for his ouster. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen have proposed cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops strength in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> can afford its own defense. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> have said the troops would remain as long as both sides feel they are needed. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Oct. 16-18 to talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on topics ranging from bilaterial security issues to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for a larger access to the Korean market. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said he planned to discuss `` the direction in which our country and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can advance as cooperative partners toward common ideals.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said trade frictions between the two countries and controversy over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> miltiary presence reflect <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s growing economy and new sense of nationalism <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which buys about 35 percent of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s exports, stood at $ 8.6 billion last year. He said friction over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its markets and to appreciate its won currency against the dollar have fueled the anti-American sentiment. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, like any other county, is seeking its national interest. He said huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits are a factor threatening the stability of the world economy and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economy, heavily dependent on exports, could suffer if the world economy falls into trouble. He said, however, that this does not mean <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should comply with all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests in opening its markets. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has threatened to retaliate if <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> refuses to increase beef imports and complained that <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> failed to protect American intellectual property rights. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence helps maintain peace and stability in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and deters an invasion from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s revamped ruling party today adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the nation and then chose the head of the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as their leader. Delegates told reporters they chose <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after key reformists reluctantly shelved their reservations to avoid a possible split within the party. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, who is considered a moderate, will lead the party during the campaign for the first free national elections in 41 years. The selection was expected to exacerbate anxieties among some reformists who want a clean break from the past and who worry that the new party will not differ substantially from its predecessor. Tension was reported following a decision by delegates Sunday to continue allowing party politics in the workplace. It has been a common practice for communists to hold meetings and conduct political courses for employees in the workplace. Reformers associate it with the indoctrination practices of traditional Marxist-Leninist communist parties. Along with <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the top candidates to lead the new party were Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, both reformers. Unlike Nyers, they supported keeping politics separate from the workplace. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was disbanded Saturday at the congress and replaced by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Founding documents describe the new party as one with Euro-Communist and Socialist leanings, committed to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy. In a vote today earlier taken by a show of hands, delegates overwhelmingly approved a manifesto calling for `` a constitutional state based on a multiparty system, where the source of power is the will of the people expressed in free elections.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was described as `` an organization in the Marxist spirit ... totally committed to democracy.'' All members of the old party are automatically members of the new one and can continue to remain so by stating their agreement with its democratic principles. The document creating the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it supports the concept of private and state property and `` the development of a ... multiparty parliamentary democracy.'' The move was the latest of a number of bold reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is in the forefront of democratic reform in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. But the initial euphoria of reformers seeking to create a party with wide popular appeal was dampened when the congress endorsed keeping politics in the workplace. Of about 1,200 delegates present for Sunday's balloting just 107 _ including <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> _ voted against the measure. There were 34 abstentions. Free national elections are to be held by June, and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will remain in power at least until then. But the new tensions could create a conflict between the party and the government, which <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> leads. A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> `` are n't talking to each other.'' Even before the workplace vote, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Medgyessy </PERSON> had urged the new party to stop interfering in government business pending the national elections. In other developments Sunday: _ A ranking Communist conservative, former Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, defied Saturday's decision by the congress to create a new party. He said the old party should should continue to exist until the rank and file decides on its fate. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribanszki </PERSON>, another opponent of change, said he planned to organize a plebiscite among the party's 720,000 members. _ Officials at the congress said the hard-line <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> leadership _ embittered over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s decision to allow East Germans free passage to the West _ had expressed its congratulations at the party's transformation. Spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> refused to elaborate, telling reporters the text of the East German message would be published today, along with one from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, a Soviet bloc country that has previously condemned Hungarian reforms. He also did not say whether the Soviets had sent congratulations.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> says his first reaction was disbelief when he was awakened by a radio interviewer this morning and told he had shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. `` I did n't know if it was a false alarm or they got my name confused, not having talked to anyone directly,'' said <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, 49. `` As we say in science, I needed confirmation of the information.'' He and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, 53, a colleague at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, won the Nobel for their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes. Their 1976 work on oncogenes, which control the growth of cells, helped explain how malignant tumors develop, the Nobel citation said. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said he was `` stunned'' by the news and called his situation this morning `` surreal.'' Later, at a news conference at UC <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> declined to speculate about the proximity of a cancer cure. `` That's an imponderable at the moment ...,'' he said. `` Certainly we have a better image of what's wrong with the cancer cell at the moment.'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said he did n't think at the time that his work would lead to the prize. `` I do n't go to work thinking about the Nobel Prize,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. `` I go to work thinking about the next experiment.'' `` Obviously, in the last few years when you look back and see that it had an impact in the field, then it becomes a possibility,'' he said. `` But it's a possibility surrounded by the incredible work of others who would also be deserving of it.'' There has been so much work in related fields in recent years that `` I was beginning to think we had gotten lost in the blizzard,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said at the news conference. He called the original work published in 1976 a `` cornerstone in understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer'' `` The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its origins in genes that normally do us some good,'' he said. `` But after they become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer.'' `` We have the seeds of cancer in our own genetic dowry,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said, adding that even so, it does n't mean that cancer is always inherited. The award includes a $ 469,000 cash prize to be split by the two. Does <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> have any spending plans? `` I need a new compact disc player,'' he responded, adding that his wife is lobbying for a built-in dishwasher. Both <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, who wore blue jeans to the news conference, and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, who was dressed in a suit and tie, said immediate plans included attending the fifth game of the National League pennant race beween the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> had showed how much he is a baseball fan by quizzing <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakuma </PERSON>, one of the journalists gathered at his doorstep, when he leared <PERSON> Sakuma </PERSON> had just come from photographing the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s return from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. He interrupted his interviews and asked <PERSON> Sakuma </PERSON>: `` Hey, what do you think of -LRB- <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON>?'' But he also showed his enthusiasm for his research, saying he hoped the publicity would give the public `` some feeling for the excitement and the beauty of understanding how cells work and the hope that we think _ we hope _ we generate by beginning to understand in very specific terms what goes wrong when a cell becomes a cancer cell.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> on Feb. 22, 1936, studied at <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and worked in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He spent time in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, before moving to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. He said he was 30 years old before he decided what direction to take with his medical career, and credited a general practitioner in rural <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who `` took me under his wing.'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where he was born Dec. 18, 1939. He studied at <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and earned his master's degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1962, the same year <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> earned his medical degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> received a medical degree from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1966. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> also worked at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> as a clinical associate before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. He said he abandoned plans to become an English professor after considering the advice given to writer <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> `` that medicine opened all doors.''

<TEXT>
 The lines are being drawn in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for coming battles over animal-protection bills. On one side is Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., who says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs a `` common-sense voice'' to combat the efforts of animal-rights activists <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> recently started recruiting like-minded collegues to join a group he tentatively calls the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have a broad concern that the use of animals for legitimate purposes ... is being unfairly projected to the general public and vilified to the general public in a way that ulitimately could have an impact on the quality of life of a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. On the other side is <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, wife of Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. She is helping him and Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, organize the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, which has already sponsored a tour of an Army laboratory in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> has enlisted three other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members so far, including Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> livestock subcommittee. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s opponents have received responses from 15 colleagues to a `` Dear Colleague'' letter announcing the new group and expect to sign up 30 to 40, Mrs. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. The caucuses plan to serve as forums for debate and clearinghousses of information on a mounting number of bills facing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Among the bills several that would make it illegal to break into laboratories and destroy documents. Other bills would set size requirements for veal-calf crates, prohibit certain lethal testing of laboratory animals and require special labels on cans of tuna that were caught in nets that endanger dolphins. Still another bill would allow someone to sue the government on behalf of an animal to make the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> enforce the Animal Welfare Act. But <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said that consumers and many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do n't realize the impact the animal-rights movement could have on farming and medical research `` I do n't think the average animal lover wants to stop research that may be vital to finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease,'' he said. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> says he is concerned that the animal-rights movement will try to write livestock protections into the 1990 farm bill. But the growing number of animal-protection bills reflects the rising public concern about animal rights, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dribben </PERSON>, director of government relations for the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Congressional offices routinely have a worker assigned to animal issues, where a few years ago they had none, she said. `` There's a growing wealth of legislation addressing animal protection issues because the public is concerned,'' she said. `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are hearing from their constituents.''

 A gas bottle exploded in a downtown apartment building Monday and killed three people, police said. The explosion in a third-floor apartment around 1 p.m. also caused injuries, a police official said, but he could not say how many people were hurt. The blast, which triggered a fire, sent the balcony of the apartment building into a shop window across the street, he said.

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>, who portrays a woman who dies needlessly of cervical cancer in a new TV movie, says the role changed her attitude toward health care. `` It made me more positive about participating in it,'' she said in the November Redbook. `` No offense to doctors, but I've never liked them. They give bad news. Before I made this movie, if I felt pain, I'd just sit and suffer.'' The `` L.A. Law'' star says she once ignored a tumor in her breast for a year `` until the pain got so bad that I could n't lift my arm.'' The problem turned out to be a benign cyst that was removed. But she says she changed her mind after portraying the real-life story of a woman who did n't learn about her condition until it was too late, although doctors had warning signs. The movie, `` I Love You Perfect,'' should `` make an impact,'' she said. `` It will make women aware that there is a need for the medical profession in their lives, but that they must participate in their own health care and not just allow other people to take over.''

 Seven-year-old <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, who as an infant received a liver transplant after her father's impassioned appeal for a donor, underwent surgery today to remove her spleen. `` She's in the recovery room now doing very well,'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said after the three-hour operation at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The girl was listed in critical but stable condition after the operation. <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said the spleen was seven or eight times normal size for a child <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s age. He also said her liver `` is perfectly normal.'' `` Hopefully, she'll do well and be out of here in a week's time,'' he said `` It's hard to predict.'' It was the first surgery for <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> since her 1982 liver transplant, which also took place at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. At the time, she was one of the youngest liver transplant recipients. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the Fiskes learned that only a liver transplant could save her life. She underwent a liver transplant after her father, then a hospital administrator, made an emotional appeal for a donor during a convention at the American Academy of Pediatricians. The nationally televised plea, including <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> singing, `` Please do n't take my sunshine away,'' resulted in the offer a few days later from a family in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> whose 11-month-old son was killed in an accident On Saturday, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said: `` We've been in worse places and times.'' Still, he said, `` It's major surgery for her, given the fact she had a liver transplant. What's giving us confidence is that we're coming back to an institution that knows her The doctors have seen her grow up.'' The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> hospital sent an air ambulance Thursday to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to pick up <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> and her father. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, who is listed in stable condition, has suffered three bouts of internal bleeding this fall, and her doctors think an enlarged spleen may be responsible, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s mind is n't on her impending surgery, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said. She's worried about whether she will be able to dress up as the <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearts </ORGANIZATION> for Halloween, he said. `` She said to me today, ` What about Halloween? Will I be back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for Halloween?''' He said doctors have estimated <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> will be in the hospital for about 10 days. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said he hopes to have <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, by <LOCATION> Halloween </LOCATION>. Doctors do n't believe <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s current problem is related to the liver transplant, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said in a news conference Saturday. Her spleen began to enlarge one year after her transplant, but doctors said there had been no complications with it until now, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said. Her current problems began in her first week of second grade this fall, when she suffered flu-like symptoms. She was hospitalized for tests and doctors found she lost a large amount of blood. When a spleen enlarges, blood vessels must find alternate routes around the organ, bulge and are likely to tear. That's what doctors believe has happened in this case, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said.

 An 80-year-old man charged with murdering his ailing wife of 55 years killed himself a few days before he was to face a competency hearing, officials said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> drank a mixture of sleeping pills, alcohol and bleach, police said, and left behind a one-sentence note that said: `` I can not live without her.'' A friend found his body Sunday morning. <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION>, had survived another suicide attempt last month. He was to face a competency hearing Tuesday before being tried on second-degree murder charges in the July 8 slaying of his 79-year-old wife, <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON>. `` He could n't bring her back, so he decided to join her,'' said the friend, Dr. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> had claimed he did not remember stabbing his wife in the heart and beating her in the head with a hammer, as police said he had done. But in a tape-recorded confession after his arrest, <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> told police `` Well, I murdered her.'' `` I see these elderly people in wheelchairs,'' he added, `` and you have to pay like four or five, six hundred dollars a week to wheel you around, you know. You'd probably have to find cheaper quarters or deplete the few dollars we have.'' <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON>'s wife suffered from arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, but police said she was not terminally ill. <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> was released from the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> on $ 25,000 bail Aug. 11 On Sept. 14, he took an overdose of prescription pills and was hospitalized under a state law used to detain people for psychological treatment if they are deemed dangerous to themselves or others. But two weeks ago, doctors said he was ready to return home. And as late as Friday, <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> was in good spirits, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON>, one of two psychiatrists who treated him. <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON> had only seven Valium pills left Friday, the doctor said. `` Seven pills, or whatever he had left after Friday, would n't kill anyone,'' <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> said `` It could n't even kill a child, probably not even with the alcohol. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION>, my God. That's just horrible.'' <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> said the bleach could burn through a victim's throat and stomach.

<TEXT>
 A French researcher who worked for the two Americans honored Monday with the Nobel Prize for medicine said he did the work on their project and should have at least shared the award. `` I am very disappointed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON>, a director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Pasteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION>. `` I find all that very unfair and rotten.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discovery of a family of genes that has helped scientists understand how cancer develops. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> work in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> cited the researchers `` for their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes.'' In 1976, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> `` published the remarkable conclusion that the oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene, but instead was a normal cellular gene,'' the citation said. Cancer viruses cause cancer with the help of animal genes that have become incorporated into the viruses. The animal genes normally help control the regular growth of cells. But when the genes become part of viruses, they can trigger the uncontrolled cell growth that typifies cancer tumors. `` I did the work all by myself, from A to Z,'' <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse. `` I spent three years in their <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lab, from 1972 to 1975, at a time when nobody other than me was working on the subject and I am not even associated in this distinction -LRB- the Nobel -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> said he was the first and principal signer of the first article in the scientific magazine Nature in 1976 on the discovery of a cellular gene, which is at the origin of the emergence of a cancer. `` A year after my depart from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where I was alone, without even a technician, two-thirds of the people in the microbiology and immunology laboratory were working on oncogenes,'' <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> said. `` This work belongs to me,'' he said, `` and I do n't know why the scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me. Undoubtedly because working in <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION> is judged less prestigious than being a researcher in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The National Endowment for the Arts, shaken by a conservative furor over subsidizing `` obscene art,'' is getting a new chairman this week who promises to strike a balance between freewheeling artistic freedom and respect for the public's trust. `` We are not the nation's official pornographer, and it's important that the country know that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, a 47-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who takes command of the beleaguered arts endowment Tuesday Nonetheless, some members of the cultural community are expressing fear that the bitter controversy over the endowment's role in financing controversial art might undermine future support for bold, innovative _ and unpopular _ artistic ventures The worst political crisis in the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s 24-year history began earlier this year when conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were outraged to discover that $ 45,000 in endowment funds had been used to support two exhibitions they found offensive. One featured works by the late photographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and pictures of nude children. The other show, by artist <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, featured a photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine. In a surprise move, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of his sweeping proposal to prohibit spending federal funds on `` obscene and indecent'' art or any work that `` denigrates, debases or reviles'' anybody on the basis of race, creed, sex, handicap, age or national origin. His amendment to the arts endowment's $ 171 million appropriations bill caused a furor in the arts community, and <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators finally produced a compromise last week that contains a watered-down version of the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> proposal. The legislation, awaiting action by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would bar government financing of works that `` may be obscene'' and lack `` serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 guideline on obscenity. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> chairman, however, would retain authority to make final decisions on the artistic merit of grant applications. Also, the bill earmarks $ 250,000 for a 12-member commission to study the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s grant-making process to determine whether new standards should be adopted governing federal subsidies for controversial art. `` It's certainly going to put a chill in the air, because the endowment is being asked not only to judge artistic quality but to act as a moral watchdog,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Hoping to avoid becoming embroiled in the controversy, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> canceled plans to display the traveling <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibition last July, but the move backfired disastrously. The venerable museum suffered artist boycotts, the resignation of the museum's chief curator, loss of a $ 1.5 million bequest from artist <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a plunge in staff morale and a tarnishing of the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s reputation as a showcase for contemporary American art. The Corcoran trustees are studying how to repair the damage, including whether director <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> should be fired. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, vacationing in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> late last week, said in a telephone interview that he intends to shift public attention from the Mapplethorpe-Serrano controversy to the endowment's largely overlooked `` good works'' in underwriting artistic excellence. `` We have a very fine line to walk here between continuing artistic freedom and maintaining the public trust, when you're using taxpayer dollars,'' said <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> He rejects any notion that he'll be coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a government censor. But he intends to find out `` how we got into this controversy in the first place, and to make sure we avoid a similar controversy in the future.'' <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said he specifically will take steps to ensure greater NEA control over grants to local arts institutions that currently dispense the money to artists at their discretion. The <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibition was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and partially financed by an NEA grant. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s works were underwritten by endowment funds awarded to the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodsoll </PERSON>, who departed in February, as chairman of the independent federal agency, which dispensed $ 156 million last year to about 800 artists and 3,800 arts institutions, from major symphony orchestras and opera companies to poets, folk artists and small-town theater companies. Grants are awarded after an exhaustive selection process involving `` peer panel review'' of applicants by fellow artists. These panels' recommendations are subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> chairman and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, the endowment's independent, presidentially appointed advisory body Besides putting the government's imprimatur on cultural endeavors of the highest quality, endowment officials say, the matching grants serve as a catalyst for private financial support of the arts. They estimate that every federal dollar spent in <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> grants has yielded more than $ 5 in contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations. The endowment is no stranger to political controversy. It has weathered recurring congressional hearings on its grant-making process. It rebuffed allegations by conservative lawmakers a few years ago that it was subsidizing `` pornographic poetry'' and wasting taxpayers' money on projects to design a new bathtub and make clothing from sheet metal. But <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON>, who drafted the legislation that created the arts endowment in 1965 and served as <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> chairman under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said `` there has been nothing in my experience like the firestorm that erupted'' over <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> is confident the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> controversy wo n't inhibit the endowment's nurturing of artistic freedom, but he sees an affirmation of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>'s warning that freedom involves responsibility. `` What has emerged is a cautionary signal to the endowment that it must be alert to difficulties that could arise from the extremely controversial,'' said <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON>. `` We're all pretty worried about censorship,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, sculptor who serves on an endowment oversight panel on the visual arts. `` I think it's vital to preserve the voices that threaten people like Mr. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>,'' she said. `` The purpose of art is to make people look at things in a different way, to solve problems in a creative way. That is not necessarily comfortable for those in power.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallery </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the `` really diabolical effect of the Helms amendment'' will be its inhibiting influence on artists rather than endowment bureaucrats In closing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate on the issue last week, Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, himself a former actor on television's `` The Love Boat,'' said he hoped his colleagues were n't getting into the business of defining `` what is good taste and what is bad taste'' in the arts. <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> noted mischievously that the current production of a local, NEA-supported theater includes what he called `` transvestism and implied lesbian love.'' The play, he said, is <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Twelfth Night,'' appearing at the Folger Shakespeare Theater.

<HEAD>Head of Solidarity Caucus Urges Faster Pace of Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Solidarity's parliamentary leader Monday urged faster changes in the mass media and `` depoliticizing'' the army and police. `` The state, which was monopolized by one party, now is becoming the property of the nation,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, assessing the record of change 100 days after the seating of the first freely elected parliament in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s postwar history and the coming to power of a Solidarity-led government last month. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that comprises 161 parliament deputies and 98 senators from Solidarity, said that although changes enacted so far are on a `` historic scale,'' they still are `` too little compared to what society wants.'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> _ the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist government leader _ are longtime co-activists in the Solidarity movement But the parliamentary leader appeared willing to criticize <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government in some areas. For instance, he said not enough changes have been made in state television and radio. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s appointee to head the state <ORGANIZATION> Radio-Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON>, has been on the job for two weeks. `` We have the right to expect acceleration of the process ... of making lies disappear from the radio and television screens,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said, apparently dissatisfied that only three newscasters prominently associated with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> propaganda have been transferred to off-screen jobs. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> have stressed they want to avoid `` witch hunts'' and political purges, demanding only that employees display competence and loyalty to the new government. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said, however, that there still needs to be a psychological and political `` break'' in the personnel and style of news presentation. He also blamed the government for `` insufficient'' information on its decisions and explaining its decisions to the public. Noting that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> had stressed the need for his government to be led by `` truth,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said: `` We think there is still a lot to be done in this field.'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said at a news conference that old habits persist within the government apparatus `` contrary to the government's intentions. He cited a recent decision to exempt collective farms from an increase in diesel fuel prices, following the communist tradition of giving them preferential treatment. `` If we do n't manage to overcome the routine of the system and those old, constantly repeated ways of governing, then even the best programs may turn out to be impossible,'' he said. `` The process of freeing the system from one-party monopoly concerns also ... the army and police,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. He noted that Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Siwicki </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, both communists, both agreed to `` the necessity of de-politicizing'' their departments. `` Those two great structures of the government should be freed from the monopoly on one party,'' said <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, referring to the practice of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committees within the army and police influencing decision-making. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> also said a public debate would be launched into whether judges should remain members of political parties. He also said consultations are taking place among parliamentary groups aimed at early passage of a constitutional amendment removing the clause that mandates that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have the leading government role. The proposed amendment, which already is supported by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputies, could be taken up by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of parliament, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After many a drab season, Italian designers are bursting out in color again for the spring and summer of 1990. For the new ready-to-wear collections being shown this week, Milanese designers have looked beyond the city shades of gray, black and brown to the bright colors of a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> holiday: sea blue, pine green, orange, lemon, coral and fuchsia. No one is better at the color game than <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, who despite more than 10 years in staid <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, has never lost the hot-blooded flare of his native <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, who presented his new collection Sunday evening, went all out with his palette for next year's warmer weather, combining a multitude of shades into beautiful silk prints for skirts, pants, jackets and dresses alike. His gaily printed jump suits in posh silk fabric are sure to be a big hit this summer. The daring shape of his clothes _ his skirts are known to be so short and tight they barely cover the hips _ and his penchant for theatrical styles has made him a favorite both in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and among rock stars. His new collection is not as sexy as past seasons, but there is enough gold and glitz to satisfy even the most demanding entertainer. Not only are his styles vivid, but they are adorned with hundreds of gold balls, tassels and colorful crystals. As if that were n't enough he sticks on a fringe here and there, and decorates his shoes with gold studs. It is a strong statement, but <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>'s exquisite tailoring and artisitic sense keep it on this side of a fashion circus. Among the new styles: high waisted silk pants with one leg slit up to the hip, mini lingerie dresses in bright shades of teffeta, bra tops and bustiers encrusted in colorful crystals, silk printed lapels on man tailored jackets, fringed piano shawls to drape over the shoulders or tie around the hips. Another champion of a colorful spring-summer 1990 was <PERSON> Missoni </PERSON>, whose new show presented at the Milan trade fair Monday combines checks and polka dots in carefree silk sun dresses and pinafores to be worn over crisp white linen dresses. For next season, his famous sweaters will be in zig-zag crochet. The new Missoni jacket is hip length and reversible, with one side in quilted fabric and the other a bulky striped knit. Also Monday, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Varty </PERSON> for Byblos chose a summer palette of rich browns, which appeared in floral prints and solids mixed with white, sienna, amethyst ruby and violet. The bright shades were to be found in the naval theme which ran throughout the collection with its gaily colored nautical flags, gold braiding, exaggerated emblems, and bold red and blue stripes.

<HEAD>Plan to Control Ivory Sales is not Working</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A meeting on wildlife trade opened Monday with the admission that a plan to control ivory sales is not working and African elephant populations are suffering an alarming decline. Prince <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> told 800 delegates and observers at a 10-day session of the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species that supporters of the ivory quota system `` must admit that it has failed to control the illegal ivory trade.'' <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, warned delegates of alarming census reports. `` You must give benefit of the doubt to the survival of the species,'' he said. The convention issued an infractions report detailing how <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, especially <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, had flouted non-ivory wildlife trade restrictions. The report also singled out <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, among others, for failing to comply with convention regulations on other species. It mentioned only the most flagrant abuses, it said, indicating widespread problems in policing international trade. A separate report dealt with ivory, the heart of the wildlife trade issue. Delegates from 103 convention nations must decide whether to leave elephants under their present designation as threatened species or list them as an endangered species, which would force a ban on ivory trade. Ivory fetches more than $ 150 a pound on world markets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> halted imports in June. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> argue that careful management has increased their elephant herds and entitles them to sell tusks to finance their game reserves. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> says it earns $ 9 million a year by selling ivory from herds estimated at 52,000. But East African states say herds have been reduced continent-wide from 1.3 million in a decade to just more than 600,000 and can only be protected by a ban that applies to the entire continent. In July, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> burned 2,500 poached ivory tusks worth $ 3 million to draw attention to the slaughter of elephants across the continent. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s population had declined from 65,000 in the 1970s to about 17,000 today. Environmentalists say poachers kill at least 70,000 elephants a year and that poorer nations such as <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and do not have the resources to stop well-armed poachers, many of whom come from neighboring countries. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of the interior and head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, said a partial ban would `` create a loophole which would allow continued illegal trade. We have no flexibility.'' Other delegates agreed, suggesting that <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> might muster the required two-thirds majority to change the elephants' status to endangered But others rallied around Southern Africa. `` We must respect the Africans' wishes,'' said <PERSON> Kiyohiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafune </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> delegation, which favors limited ivory trade. Convention Secretary-General <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON> suggested a split listing that would ban trade where elephant populations are at risk but allow quotas for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. The World Wide Fund for Nature and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> backed a ban but left room for maneuver. `` We would support a split listing with a moratorium to gain time,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> of TRAFFIC, an enforcement group associated with the conservation groups. `` The alternative is to back <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the wall, so they file reservations and open the door to abuse.'' The convention's rulings are non-legally binding agreements that rely on international pressure for enforcement. Convention members are allowed to file a so-called reservation to bypass guidelines for an individual species. The position of the conservation groups was met by anger from a range of other environmentalist groups, mostly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that have lobbied for an immediate ban. `` We should stand together on what is necessary and let governments do the compromising,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It's incredible when official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British positions are stronger than some environmentalists'.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said: `` The compromise approach has meant the death of hundreds of thousands of African elephants. `` Only a total ban with a really concerted effort to shut down the markets can save the elephants.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyster </PERSON>, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's 19-person delegation, said: `` Our objective is a total ban but we are not wedded to the mechanism.'' He blamed individual nations for a gross failure to enforce regulation and said the convention lacked the resources to fulfill its mandate. <PERSON> Lyster </PERSON> also said that even a total ban would not be enough. `` We must make the wearing of ivory, using of ivory, as socially unacceptable as wearing a cheetah-skin coat,'' he said.

 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> must present plans this week for the swift abolition of apartheid or face intensified international pressure, three anti-apartheid church leaders said Monday. The clergymen _ Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> _ are scheduled to meet with de Klerk in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on Wednesday. It will be <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s first meeting with prominent anti-apartheid leaders since he took office in mid-August. The church leaders said <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, will attend the summit of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders Oct. 18 in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, will travel soon to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Before they go, we want to hear from Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> personally his response to the demands of our people, whether he persists in his refusal to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and what concrete steps he intends to take within the next six months to abolish apartheid and introduce a non-racial democracy,'' their statement said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has offered to negotiate a new consitution in five years that would extend political rights to the black majority, but he has vowed not to negotiate with leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement until they renounce violence. Also Sunday, government television reported that <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, was arrested after he threatened to `` activate a device'' on an aircraft. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and asked to get off the plane as it made a brief stop in the southern city of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported. When he was refused permission, he allegedly pushed crew members out of his way and went into the terminal building, then threatened to `` activate a device'' in his luggage, the report said. In August, the 32-year-old <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was given an 18-month suspended sentence for making a false bomb threat at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s airport. At that time, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he deliberately courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt for his advertising agency. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> also has been convicted of five additional charges stemming from two other confrontations with police. His father has not commented on his legal troubles.

 The countdown for this week's planned launch of space shuttle Atlantis began Monday as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> headed for a court showdown with anti-nuclear activists seeking to stop the flight because of its plutonium-powered payload If a federal judge approves, Atlantis is to blast off at 1:29 p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft with its nuclear generators on the start of a six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. A band of 25 protesters demonstrated Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, played out a mock death scene, and vowed that if they are turned down by the court, they will sit on the launch pad if necessary to halt the launch. Attorneys for the space agency and three citizens' groups are to present oral arguments Tuesday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The launch opponents contend that an explosion on liftoff could spread cancer-causing plutonium over a large area of east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials argue the two nuclear generators aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft have been thoroughly tested and that flying them poses minimal health and environmental risks. Similar devices have flown on 22 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft without a problem. `` We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we are told to stop,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said Monday as the countdown got under way. He described Atlantis as in `` terrific shape.'' The astronauts assigned to the mission flew here Monday from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for final flight preparations. All five have said they are not worried about the plutonium in the cargo bay. `` My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about it; I feel it's safe,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, one of the crew members. The others are commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>. The protesters began their demonstration Monday with a mock countdown that ended with a woman spreading in the air dust-like particles representing plutonium. The participants all fell to the ground in make-believe death. `` We're going to attempt to put people of the launch pad if the court does n't prevent the launch,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, one of the protest leaders, told reporters. <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> would not disclose how the demonstraters would breach security to reach the pad, but he said the effort, to be made `` Wednesday or Thursday, or both,'' would be non-violent. He is coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three groups that sued. More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center to stop infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by helicopters and boats. But there is only a 10-minute launch window available on Thursday, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is concerned the time would be consumed if protesters penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or on foot in the final minutes of the countdown.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes First Strike Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislators on Monday gave Soviet workers the legal right to strike, the first such measure in the nation's history Following a daylong debate, the Supreme Soviet legislature passed the complex measure that bans strikes by workers in almost a dozen sectors, but also provides other workers with a legal framework under which to strike. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s need for a such a labor law became urgent this summer, when hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on strike for better working conditions and political change. Stoppages based on ethnic conflicts also have become commonplace, with thousands of Russian workers in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> walking out recently to protest laws they viewed as disciminatory. Although they were not expressly forbidden by Soviet law, the few strikes that broke out in recent years were brutally suppressed. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms opened the door to louder labor demands, and he backed the law that will provide labor conflicts a legal framework. Only 12 Supreme Soviet deputies of more than 400 voted against the strike bill, with 10 members abstaining, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency said the law prohibits strikes that `` create a threat to people's lives and health,'' as well as work stoppages by workers in railroads, public transportation, civil aviation, communications, energy, defense, government bodies, law enforcement and round-the-clock production industries. It also forbids strikes `` connected with the putting forth of demands for a violent overthrow or change of the government or social system, and also demands involving the violation of ethnic or racial equality,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In order to hold a legal strike, a union must first give a `` conciliatory commission'' made up of representatives of both labor and management five days to attempt to resolve the dispute. If that fails, the sides must give arbitration seven days to work things out. Only then, with all other options exhausted, does it have the right to strike. Deputies to the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet legislature that was a mere rubber stamp until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms gave it real power, contested many of the law's provisions Monday and voted on some 50 proposed amendments. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called for some type of acceptable political strike to be written into the law, but his proposal was defeated on a procedural technicality, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Several deputies complained that too many sectors were prohibited from striking. Under the new law, those sectors can appeal to the Supreme Soviet with their complaints. The law comes on the heels of an emergency measure passed by the Supreme Soviet on Oct. 3 banning strikes until the general law could be passed. The coal strikes last summer, which paralyzed much of the country's crucial coal industry and were stemmed only after the government conceded on virtually all the miners' demands, appeared to be the greatest crisis <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had faced in more than four years. Although he expressed sympathy for the miners, he has said repeatedly such strikes could lead to anarchy and an economic crash for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Bahamanian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, at odds with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> over allegations about drug smuggling, has canceled a Wednesday appearance on the network's `` Today'' show to discuss the libel lawsuit he dropped. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> on Friday accused the network of violating an agreement by announcing earlier in the day that he had dropped his lawsuit, filed in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> in 1984, against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and correspondent <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The $ 4 million lawsuit, which also named as defendants 16 Canadian cable and communications companies, stemmed from `` NBC Nightly News'' broadcasts in 1983 and 1984 about a cocaine cartel <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said was operating in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The broadcasts quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as saying the cocaine operation was protected by payoffs to <LOCATION> Bahamanian </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said repeatedly declined requests for interviews before dropping his lawsuit, has denied <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations that he was among those officials In a statement Friday in which he said <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> received neither money nor an apology from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for the broadcasts, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was delighted that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> dropped his lawsuit. `` This is a complete vindication of our journalism,'' he said. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> later charged that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s statements violated a confidentiality agreement on the lawsuit and distorted the terms under which it was dropped. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> denied both accusations Friday and again Monday. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> may reinstate the Canadian court lawsuit, and a lawsuit in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts `` has n't been ruled out,'' his spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON>, said Monday. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was to appear on `` Today'' `` to discuss in general terms the -LRB- Friday -RRB- settlement,'' <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>. But he canceled `` when <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> abrogated the settlement,'' he said. In an interview made before Friday's developments and broadcast Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> said he first sued <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in his own country's courts and `` won the case by default'' because <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did n't respond. <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said no money was awarded in that case. After that, <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcast, `` I decided to sue in a neutral jurisdiction,'' referring to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The matter of reinstating <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s lawsuit is being discussed by his attorneys, <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. But because Monday was a holiday _ Thanksgiving _ in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he said, `` there probably wo n't be a decision until tomorrow.''

 Arab League mediators struggled Monday to salvage a peace plan aimed at ending <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war, and one of the Lebanese lawmakers gathered for negotiations said they were making headway. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, said the three-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee was trying `` to devise a mechanism that would guarantee'' implementation of the peace plan. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 33 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and 30 Moslem parliament members have been meeting in this Saudi resort since Sept. 30 to try to end their nation's 14-year-old war. Hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies who owe allegiance to <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> are demanding guarantees that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> pull out its 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before they will cooperate. The demand has blocked parliament sessions for four days, and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee sought help from Arab and other powers, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` The contacts of the tripartite committee are moving very well,'' <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>. The members of the committee are King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> did not elaborate but said the deputies and the mediators were `` doing everything to make the conference succeed.'' The 87-year-old deputy declared tearfully that `` I affirm to my brothers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that success is inevitable and failure is forbidden.'' Moslem legislators who support the Syrians want more power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian-dominated government. Under the peace plan presented by the Arab mediators, sectarianism would be abolished gradually as law and order were restored. Syrian forces in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> would be withdrawn over two years and relocated in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; a full pullout would follow a security pact between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. The Christians want the Syrians out within six months, but many Moslems insist there can be no withdrawal until the Maronites agree to surrender some of the power they have held since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 Under an unwritten covenant, the president has always been a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite. At independence, the Christians were considered the majority, but Moslems now make up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee was pressing the Lebanese legislators to meet deadlines it has set for elections. The daily said the committee proposed Oct. 25 as the date for a parliament session in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to elect a speaker, with another session soon afterward to endorse reforms agreed to in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>. Parliament would reconvene Nov. 5 to elect a new president, the newspaper said. The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> began in March when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> launched a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrians. Six months of fierce artillery battles killed more than 900 people before a cease-fire brokered by the Arab League took hold Sept. 22. The Syrian troops moved into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976, the year after the civil war broke out, under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> alleges the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> lost their mandate by openly siding with the Moslems.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has invited the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to send officials to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to help ease the conflict between Sinhalese rebels and the government, an official statement said Monday. A statement issued by the presidential secretariat said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials will help trace missing persons, visit detention centers and provide relief to people affected by violence. The invitation follows charges by human rights groups that pro-government vigilante organizations are responsible for a wave of killings, mostly of young Sinhalese men believed to be sympathizers of radicals. The government has denied the charges and blames the radicals for most of the 5,000 deaths reported since the Sinhalese extremist movement began in July 1987. In its latest violence report Monday, the government reported 43 killings. The victims included 16 young Sinhalese men found dead in the spot where the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese extremist group, ambushed an army patrol last week. The government blamed `` vigilantes,'' who they said were outraged by attacks on government troops, for the 16 killings. Officials also blamed vigilantes for killing three men whose bodies were found Monday at <LOCATION> Moratuwa </LOCATION>, 11 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. All 19 victims died of gunshot wounds, military officials said. They estimated the victims' ages at between 18 and 30. Thirteen Sinhalese extremists were shot and killed during a series of government operations in the past 24 hours against the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the government said. The communique, issued by the government's information department, said large quantities or arms and ammunition were recovered in the operations. Members of the Sinhalese front killed 11 civilians in the past 24 hours, the military officials said. They said most of the victims were officials or supporters of the government. The front has been attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government for two years, since the government agreed to an accord designed to give greater autonomy to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil minority. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> espouses Marxism but increasingly has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the country's 16 million people. Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population, are mainly Hindus, and began fighting six years ago for an independent homeland. Predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, spurred by its own Tamil minority, tried to broker an agreement to end Sinhalese-Tamil violence but instead got bogged down in its own war with Tamil guerrillas when it tried to disarm them.

 Film canisters with hundreds of negatives of eye retinas were found and returned to the photographer Monday, ending a two-day search after they were stolen from a car, police said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue producing new chemical weapons over a 10-year period even if it signs an international treaty to abolish all poison gas stockpiles, an administration official said Monday. The text of the treaty being negotiated by about 40 nations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> proposes that all production be stopped immediately and that the plants be rendered inoperable. However, the administration will seek modifications to ensure that it can keep its stockpiles up to date even as it scales them down, said the official, who declined to be identified. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a Sept. 25 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said that once a global treaty is signed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over an eight-year period, if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> takes idetical action. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the remaining stockpiles would be destroyed over the next two years, if `` all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total ban treaty.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile consists of `` unitary'' weapons, many of which are leaking and deemed unsafe, and newer `` binary'' weapons that use two components to make them lethal. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has instructed the administration to destroy the unitary weapons as the newer binary weapons are produced. `` You do n't want to get eight years down the road and have only unitary, leaking old weapons left,'' the official said. `` As long as you're going to have any, you ought to try to make sure the ones you have are as safe as possible.'' The official said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intention of continuing to produce the weapons during the phaseout period was made known to Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> during talks last month in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.

 A rundown Lutheran Church in a shabby section of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has become the rallying point for once-disparate opposition groups aiming for historic reforms in their communist homeland. Outside <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, there were violent clashes in recent days as police moved in to crush peaceful protests for democratic reform. Public support for change has swelled in the city and other parts of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent weeks. Nationwide protests the past three days have been the largest since 1953, when Soviet tanks helped put down a popular uprising. The wave of unrest came as the communist government held elaborately choreographed state ceremonies marking the nation's 40th anniversary Like <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, which became the focal point of Solidarity activities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the weathered 19th century <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is a magnet for activists to discuss strategy and political platforms. `` We come here because we want peaceful change and because there is nowhere else where we can find sanctuary,'' said an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> human rights activist in her 20s. The church became the center for dissidents after protesters began a vigil and fast last week for imprisoned activists. When police charge protesters to disperse them, hundreds flee to the legal sanctuary of the fenced-in church grounds. Scores of others often spend the night inside, fearing they will be arrested if they attempt to leave. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has long pursued an uneasy policy of coexistence with the state, it has also provided a haven for independent human rights and ecology groups. Its leadership has urged the government to enter into a dialogue with dissident groups, and many pastors have become increasing vocal in their criticism of the hardline leadership's rejection of reforms. Thousands of supporters stream to the red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> each day to hold rallies and to learn of the latest developments from the growing opposition network around the country. Hundreds of candles glitter at the entrance to show solidarity with those arrested and imprisoned in demonstrations across the country. Banners calling for peace and freedom flap from the church's scaffolded steeple Pastors scurry about, helping with logistics and urging those assembled to avoid violence. Activists standing on the chipped concrete steps pass plastic buckets around to collect donations for opposition causes. Hardline communist authorities have deployed hundreds of security officials surrounding the church to prevent groups from heading to main thoroughfares. They fear the daily rallies will snowball into mass demonstrations like those that erupted over last weekend. Uniformed police officers check the identity papers of those attempting to reach the church. The area has been declared off-limits to Western television crews and news photographers since Sunday. Western reporters were refused access again Monday. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition movement has long been plagued by intense government suppression. Security officials routinely harrass its members, and emerging leaders have been frequently expelled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The groups have been fractious and small and, until recently, were only able to achieve a loose countrywide network. Many began as ecological and peace discussion groups. But the groups have become increasing bolder, buoyed by reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Growing frustration over the government's intransigence to change and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has also spurred many pro-democracy supporters to broader public activism. Last week, seven pro-democracy and rights groups signed a joint declaration saying they would work together so that `` all East Germans have the right to exercise their political rights.'' `` We have a duty to demand from the state and party leadership that they restore the people's confidence in the government,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a founder of one of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s oldest human rights groups.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> cancer researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League baseball playoffs. `` We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' a jubilant <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said shortly after he and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> learned that they had won this year's prize. The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest medical university, cited <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are altered forms of normal animal genes. The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and it `` widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> called the research a `` cornerstone in understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer.'' `` The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its origins in genes that normally do us some good. But after they become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer,'' he said. The two scienists are colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. They originally published their prize-winning findings in 1976. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said winning the award was `` surreal,'' while <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> it was startling when the telephone began ringing at 4 a.m. `` We just assumed one of the grandparents had some trouble, so we were frightened,'' he said. But his alarm quickly turned to exultation, especially when the $ 469,000 award _ to be split between the two _ began paying off in unexpected ways. When reporters swarmed to his home early in the morning, <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> had said he only wished he could use the Nobel money to buy tickets to the sold-out championship game between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> at Candlestick Park. A short time later, he received four free tickets compliments of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, U.C. spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> already had his own tickets. At a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> were optimistic about the practical applications of their work, how it helps understand the nature of cancer and possibly some aspects of the AIDS virus. But they were cautious about forecasting a cancer cure in the foreseeable future. `` This is just another step in what's a long journey,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` It's very difficult to predict when a full view of the cancer cell will be at hand.'' Although <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> stressed that he and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> `` stand on the shoulders of those who came before us,'' at least one scientist said he resented carrying their weight. Dr. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> researcher who carried out experiments overseen by <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the 1970s, said it was `` very unfair and rotten'' that he was n't included in the prize `` I did the work all by myself, from A to Z,'' <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> called <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON>'s work `` crucial'' to their research, but referred questions about the prize to the Nobel committee. `` We did n't nominate each other,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. `` You may know you're in the running, but nevertheless, there are a lot of other good people in there too. ... It's a shock,'' said <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, dressed casually in blue jeans and a red and white striped shirt, and a light beard that was apparently the result of a hasty shaving job. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, 49, who once hoped to become an English professor, said he abandoned his studies of 17th century literature to attend medical school. He said he switched fields after learning that writer <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> had enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after being told that `` medicine opens all doors.'' Gradually, he discovered he enjoyed being in the laboratory more than the clinic, and his research career began, he said. `` My mother died of breast cancer, but I do n't know if that in itself caused me to study the cause of cancer. ... There's hardly anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, 53, said he was interested in science in high school, and decided to become a doctor. But he said that `` by the time I finished college, I was n't so sure I wanted to be a doctor.'' It was a rural <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> general practioner, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kough </PERSON>, who became his mentor and convinced him that his calling was in medical research. Both <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said they plan to return to the lab, and they do n't expect their lives to be dramatically altered by the Nobel Prize. `` I like my life the way it is, and I hope it stays that way,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. `` The danger is you're supposed to be smarter today than you were yesterday, and I'm not.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> began a visit to the world's most populous Moslem nation Monday with a message of friendship and assurances that his <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> flock was loyal to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. In an atmosphere of controversy over a scheduled stop in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1976, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> sought to make clear that <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> were no threat to the archipelago's unity. `` I have come as a friend to all Indonesians, with a great respect for all the people of this dynamic nation,'' he said. A tropical rainstorm drenched the city of nearly 8 million as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived after a 7-hour flight from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> knelt and kissed the wet tarmac in sticky, 90-degree heat. Soldiers lined the 10-mile motorcade route from the military airport to the presidential palace, set in a ring of palm trees. He was greeted by President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s pro-Western leader. There have been reports of several threats to the pontiff's life by Moslem extremists in this nation of 13,766 islands and about 200 ethnic and religious groups. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> sought to make clear that his visit, and the 5 million Catholics among <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s 157 million Moslems, pose no threat. During a Mass at a sports stadium built by the Soviets under President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to independence from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1949, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> expressed `` cordial esteem'' to `` our Moslem brothers and sisters, who are so numerous in this country.'' `` I extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our common belief in the one God, our creator and merciful Lord,'' he said, speaking in English. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Catholic Indonesians were deeply proud of their country. `` We must be fully <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and fully <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` These words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of the nation.'' In an exchange of speeches with <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> at an evening reception, the pope touched lightly on the issue of human rights, stressing that respect for individual rights is essential for the unity of a nation. <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> said, `` Men should seek to share identical things and not to aggravate differences among them.'' <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has criticized the stop in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, scheduled for Thursday, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> says the visit does not imply <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> recognition of the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> takeover. He told reporters on the trip from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> that skipping the island would be an `` offense'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s Catholics, who the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says number nearly 80 percent of the 690,000 people. The pope is scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on Saturday for the island nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, and return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> two days later.

<HEAD>Real Estate Firm With Ties to HUD Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 A real estate investment firm will close and absorb a $ 675,000 loss rather than continue an association with its manager _ a former federal housing official linked to recent scandals at the department, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> is shutting down, but <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional administrator for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, will go to work at other companies of the firm's founder, the newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer as saying `` The partners just do n't want to be involved in a situation that has attracted so much publicity,'' lawyer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Biegen </PERSON> said. `` These people are all prominent, respected businessmen. They have fine reputations. They want to keep them that way.'' Monticciolo, Housing and Urban Development regional administrator from 1981 to 1988, testified in July before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating allegations of mismanagement and favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> testified that he earmarked large sums of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money for developers who later became partners at Eagle Capital. `` I made recommendations to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that ultimately benefited people who are now partners of mine,'' he said.

<HEAD>Machinists Ask for Union Support as Boeing Strike Enters Day 6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM COUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> met with 25 other labor unions Monday to ask for their support while their six-day walkout against the airplane manufacturer dragged on with no signs of new contract talks. `` We're here to brief the other unions to what our strike is all about ... so we'll be prepared for monetary support and those types of things if hardship needs arise,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, Local 751. The strike is affecting <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area; <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; and several other sites. In <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, hundreds of strikers rallied Monday before joining pickets for a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was a similar rally in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where the popular 747s and 767s are built. One <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> hourly employee who has been crossing picket lines reported his car was vandalized during the weekend. Local strike coordinator <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said the union does n't sanction property damage or injury and that there is no proof the vandalism happened because of the strike. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' decision to cross picket lines, saying that would n't affect the 57,800 striking Machinists' ability to halt production at the world's largest commercial jet builder. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials were in a meeting Monday and did not immediately return telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> left a recording on his answering machine saying no talks were scheduled. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered two planes since the strike began Wednesday. Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was committed to delivering 57 jets before the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record orders have given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s. That backlog and the steady stream of overtime which employees have been asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for better wages and less overtime. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 356 million on sales of $ 9.07 billion for the first half of 1989, and had profits of $ 614 million on sales of $ 16.96 billion in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990. Mandatory overtime would be reduced from 200 hours per quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula would be improved to account for virtually all inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said a machinist in a middle skill grade, such as an engine mechanic, could see pay go from $ 34,389 this year to $ 43,138 in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, but excluding $ 13,000 in bonuses and any overtime. The Machinists, who have seen bonuses but no increases in their base wage for six years, said that was not enough. `` They need airplanes delivered and we want to get back and deliver them. But we want our fair share and that's what we're atempting to get,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said It is the Machinists' first strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> since a 45-day walkout in 1977. What happens at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could affect labor talks at other aerospace plants. Talks have been extended in a Machinists contract that expired Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The union's contract with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> expires Oct. 22.

<HEAD>Drifter Pleads Guilty, Tells Authorities Where Body is Located</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARINETTE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unemployed drifter pleaded guilty Monday to kidnapping an 11-year-old girl and told authorities he accidentally killed her nearly 2 -LCB- years ago and buried her in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The plea by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>, 43, averted a trial scheduled to begin Monday, but a prosecutor said more charges are possible in the July 1987 disappearance of <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciulis </PERSON>. District Attorney <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> said he does not believe <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>'s account of the child's death. `` The prosecution reserves the right to charge him with first-degree or second-degree murder ... if in fact he takes us to the body and through scientific or forensic evidence it can be proven the death was not of an accidental nature,'' <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> said. Lawyers said the plea agreement calls for <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> to serve 25 years in prison on the kidnapping charge. If the body is not located, <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> has agreed to plead guilty to an extortion charge involving an unrelated incident and will serve an additional six years in prison. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> accepted the agreement but delayed sentencing until authorities search for the body. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> agreed to accompany officials to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for the search, officials said. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> told authorities he accidentally struck and killed <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> with his car, then placed her body in a duffel bag, drove to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and buried her in woods near <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The agreement was reached during negotiations over the weekend between the defendant, defense attorney <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Finne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Marinette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravet </PERSON>, who said he, Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Skorik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> and <PERSON> Finne </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Tuesday to search for <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s body. Authorities said they consulted with <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON>, and she had no objections to the plea agreement. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> disappeared from her mother's <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION> apartment in July 1987, touching off a nationwide search. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> was originally charged with kidnapping, enticing a minor for immoral purposes, and attempted second-degree sexual assault, but the latter two counts were dropped in the plea bargain. The attempted sex assault charge was for an incident involving a teen-age neighbor of the <PERSON> Maciulis </PERSON> family, authorities said. According to authorities, at the time of <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s disappearance she and her mother and sister were living at the same apartment complex where <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> was living with a woman. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> said he was driving out of town when he discovered <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> in the back seat of his car. He said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> asked him to drive her to her father's home near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> said that because he had a criminal record, he became scared and told her to return home. He said that when he turned his car around, she was standing in the way and was struck, and stopped breathing. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> said he dumped clothing out of a duffel bag, put her body in it and headed south. Finne, the defense attorney, said <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>'s plea was appropriate. `` The defendant faces strong evidence of conviction and he legally acknowledges the strength of the state's case, but not necessarily beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> said the agreement was also in the best interest of the state because the case was based mostly on circumstantial evidence. `` I am happy with the agreement. I am happy the defendant will do a significant amount of prison time, but I am disappointed out case was n't strong enough to proceed to trial without any reservations.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reszoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, who was elected Monday as president of the new <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was also chairman of the now-dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is one of the most experienced politicians and economists in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` We are breaking ... with the exercise of power along the lines of the dictatorship of the proletariat,'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, 66, told delegates to the congress on Sunday, a day after the new party was established. A printer by trade, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> early on. After the party merged with the communists in 1948, he was a party secretary, then studied economics. A champion of political reform and an experienced economist who believes in a `` socialist'' market economy, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was voted into the Politburo in May 1988. It was a stunning political comeback after many years in political limbo and came as the result of a major reshuffle that saw longtime party chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> ousted and replaced by <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. `` Whoever is a reform communist or a Euro-communist and accepts the fact that the party has to be of a socialist -LRB- nature -RRB- ... can be a member of a new kind of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was quoted as saying Sunday, making it clear most communists can join it. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>' history of managing economic and financial affairs dates to 1960 when he became finance minister, a job he held until 1962. As a member of the party's ruling Politburo, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> became known as the father of the pioneering economic reforms that gave Hungarians the highest living standards in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But in 1974, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was dropped from the Politburo and stripped of his economics post as <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> put a brake on reforms that apparently alarmed <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who then was in power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>' vast experience was the reason for his appointment last November as special economics minister to steer <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> through a period of austerity. Now, he will have to steer the new party through a period of political transition and help it compete in the first multiparty elections next year.

<TEXT>
 A 23-year-old cousin of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> says she is pregnant and her parents cut off her funds, instructing her to have an abortion or marry her boyfriend immediately, the newspaper Today said Monday. It quoted <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> as saying she had written a letter to the queen asking her to intervene with the young woman's parents, Princess <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, sister of the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION>, is the queen's first cousin. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> is 24th in line to the throne. The Ogilvys issued a brief statement saying they loved their daughter, they had not cut her off and she always was welcome at home. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace, when asked if the royal family would have a statement, replied: `` None whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> is a pianist who won a place at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s respected <ORGANIZATION> Guildhall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, but recently turned it down. She worked as a survival course instructor in 1987, once worked in the complaints department of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> store and has a diploma in cooking. She generally has avoided the public eye and made clear her desire to live a more independent life than many royal family members do. Today quoted <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> as saying she and her boyfriend, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowatt </PERSON>, 26, want to marry after the baby is born. The newspaper did not say when the baby was due. She and <PERSON> Mowatt </PERSON> live with his parents in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, editor of Today, said the newspaper was contributing to the couple's daily expenses. He said he had `` absolutely no doubts'' about the report, which was a rare public airing of a private royal dispute. `` I can say 100 percent that her story is true and we reported it 100 percent accurately,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. As quoted in Today, Miss <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said her parents stopped her monthly allowance of $ 450 and denied her access to trust funds. She was quoted as saying that, when she asked her father, `` ` What comes first, queen and country, or your own daughter?' he responded: ` Queen and country.''' Today quoted her as saying she thought her parents tried to trick her into an abortion when she went to her doctor. `` We are sure now that the surgery -LRB- doctor's office -RRB- tried to fix an abortion and pretend it was a routine examination,'' Miss <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> was quoted as saying. According to the report, she does not dare go home because `` I am frightened they will try and keep me there against my will.'' About the letter to the queen, Today quoted <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> as saying: `` I know she is a wise and caring woman. I just hope she can help my parents see sense.'' A statement issued on behalf of Princess <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> and her husband said they `` are concerned at the number of inaccuracies. In particular, they have not ` cut off' their daughter. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> is always welcome at her home. They love her very much and feel deeply for her at this difficult time.''

<HEAD>President Pledges to End Mexican Newsprint Monopoly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said Monday he will end a government-controlled monopoly on the importation and sale of inexpensive newsprint in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The monopoly has been used in past years to retaliate against newspapers that failed to toe the government or ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s line by making it difficult or expensive for dissidents to buy newsprint elsewhere. `` Allow me to announce that, once we sell PIPSA, we will allow free and total importation of newsprint, and thus avoid a monopoly by certain groups that could affect freedom of press expression,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> told 450 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting in this northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was greeted with a standing ovation and shouts of `` bravo, bravo!'' when he announced the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Productora </ORGANIZATION> e Importadora de Papel, S.A. de C.V., popularly known by its Spanish initials of PIPSA, which is jointly owned by the government and long-established newspapers. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> did not give any deadline for the sale in his speech at the opening session of <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 45th annual general assembly in this <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state capital, about 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> has about 1,300 members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. PIPSA was founded by President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> in 1935 when world prices of newsprint skyrocketed and Mexican publishers were hard pressed for money. It imported newsprint duty-free and distributed it among affiliated newspapers, virtually all of which were sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. When PIPSA's charter expired in 1965, the members voted to renew it for another 30 years. But <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has been pressing for the monopoly's dissolution since he took office Dec. 1, as part of a campaign to cut government subsidies and encourage competition in the free market and greater press freedom in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Many established publishers said they favored continuing PIPSA when <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> first announced publicly that his administration was in favor of reopening the newsprint market. But many more _ especially provincial newspapers _ said they were all for it. `` It's a magnificent measure,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, executive editor of El Imparcial of northwestern <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state, said in an interview. He said PIPSA `` has been a weapon that the government can use at any moment.'' Without subsidized newsprint some papers can find it difficult to survive, especially in the saturated <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> market. In his speech, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said his administration will follow a policy of `` strict respect for freedom of expression'' and `` provide maximum security'' for <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> journalists. `` A modern government accepts criticism,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said, adding that such criticism spurs administrations to correct or improve their policies. A total of 29 Mexican journalists were slain during President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s six-year administration that preceded <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. Government spokesmen said most of the killings were common crimes, involving disputes or hold-ups, but journalists have insisted they had political motives. The only case brought to trial so far is that of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior. He was shot on a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street in May 1984 and his assassination remained a mystery until a federal security chief and an agent were arrested last June. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> was shot because he had uncovered a federal security official's role in drug trafficking. Several others were also arrested and are on trial as conspirators in the case, but there is continued speculation that a coverup has concealed the roles of high-ranking de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> administration officials. Advances and setbacks in press freedom in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were among the major topics for discussion by the association on Monday. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>, vice president of the association's <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> singled out <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as `` the two most critical cases this year.''

Food, television and rock' n' roll, according to youngsters asked to write essays for Columbus Day. `` The first thing <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> did was to build a house to live in and he went to get food,'' wrote <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubiak </PERSON>, one of the fourth-graders assigned the task at <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. `` He fixed his boat because he hit it on the way over to land. Then he listened to some rock music,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> wrote. The students were asked to describe what <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> might have said when he spotted the new world. <PERSON> Nichelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> offered these hasty remarks: `` I'm in such a hurry to find some food.

 Dogs, gerbils _ and even a ferret _ got special prayers and their owners sang `` Bless the Beasts and the Children'' during a special service organized by animal welfare groups. `` I've done a lot of unusual things. This is one of them,'' Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said of the service Sunday for about 30 animals at a city park. Two other ministers also participated in the service, organized in celebration of the Oct. 4 feast day of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, the patron saint of nature and animals. `` They were mostly dogs and some gerbils,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister. `` There also was one ferret.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the service was a `` recognition of the fact that the animals are a part of God's creation ...'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> brought <PERSON> Ragamuffin </PERSON>, her toy fox terrier. `` He's getting old,'' she said. `` I feel this blessing will help.''

 The city transit system has found a way to get car-crazed commuters out of their automobiles _ offer free bus rides. Ridership on city buses has risen about 44 percent since Oct. 1, when the three-month, ride-for-free program began. The bus fare is usually 50 cents. `` We're very pleased. We've had so many extra riders that we've put extra buses on the road just to handle the overcapacity,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a transit spokeswoman Usually, about 50,000 people a day ride city buses. The number rose as high as 76,000 daily in the program's first week.

 Authorities on Monday quarantined three mixed-breed dogs that attacked and killed a 73-year-old woman as she picked up a newspaper in her front yard. A neighbor used a baseball bat to run off the dogs, but <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> died shortly after the attack Sunday. The state attorney's office Monday was considering criminal charges against <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scherrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laramore </PERSON>, neighbors who owned the dogs, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgs </PERSON> said. The three dogs _ one of them pregnant _ were held in the county pound. `` We're holding them until we get word from the state,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, animal control supervisor. `` Under normal circumstances, they would be held in quarantine for 10 days to determine if they had rabies, then released to their owners.'' The county would hold on to the dogs if charges were filed against their owners, <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. County officials initially identified the animals as English bulldogs _ a small, pug-nosed breed _ arousing the ire of owners and breeders of the dogs, who contend they are not as aggressive as pit bulls. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said Monday that animal control officials were not sure of the breed. `` We're saying they're mixed bulldogs,'' <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. `` It could be English and pit.

<HEAD>Trinity Theater Tells Patrons: Pay What You Can Afford</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At a time when the price of theater tickets is soaring beyond the reach of many, Trinity Repertory Theater will try a one-night experiment Tuesday of letting patrons pay what they will. `` The objective is is to give everyone an opportunity to come to the theater,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Langan </PERSON>, managing director of the theater company. The normal ticket price for the preview performance of <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>'s `` Summerfolk'' _ a story <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> described as one about the Russian Empire's version of yuppies before the 1917 revolution _ is $ 24. Based on similar experiments in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> said he expected people would be willing to pay $ 3 to $ 4. `` But that's OK,'' he said. `` The whole purpose of this is for someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater.'' Patrons can pay as little as they want _ the only rule is no freebies, he said. But <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> would n't mind if someone decided the theater really was worth more than $ 24 a ticket. Award-winning theaters like <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION>, which started in a church 25 years ago, face pressures to mount increasingly expensive productions. `` I think that some people have perceived that we've become less affordable,'' <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> said. `` But there is a great pressure to produce quality shows, and then the discussion gets into money and then there's pressure on ticket prices.'' With a large artistic community centered at the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> said he expected many of those taking advantage of the name-your-own-price offer would be close to the starving artist stereotype. Trinity has set aside $ 5,000 from a grant to cover projected losses. The theater and its new artistic director, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, hope to find sponsors for similar nights, but already it must seek outside helpto meet regular expenses because even the $ 24 regular price for weekday performances does n't make ends meet, <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> said. Only weekend theatergoers, who pay $ 30, actually cover the costs of the 550-seat theater, he said. Trinity, with student and other discounts, averages about $ 20 a ticket.

<HEAD>Soldiers Dispatched to Help Clear Hurricane Debris</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> arrived Monday to help clear away mountains of tinder-dry debris, damaged furniture and destroyed appliances that litter lawns and homes devastated by Hurricane Hugo. In central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, landfills are overflowing with trash from hurricane cleanup efforts, and officials searched for temporary dumps. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he hoped much of the debris in his city could be cleared in two weeks, but <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers were not as optimistic. `` We could have people cleaning up for the next six months,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, district engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the effort. No one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and highways, but <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said 1,000 truck loads a day are moved out of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> alone. About 250 engineers and soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, arrived Monday equipped with 13 front-end loaders and 40 dump trucks for a weeklong assignment. They were scheduled to hit the streets of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> counties Tuesday to begin work. The <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> will arrange with private contractors to complete the cleanup. Last week, the same troops cleared roads in rural areas and helped build sand dunes to protect erosion-scarred beaches along a 60-mile stretch of the coast known as the Grand Strand. `` These kids have been on a tour of the state nonstop,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>. Across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 24 counties and 1.8 million people were affected when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> rolled through the state Sept. 21, killing 18 and causing an estimated $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion in damage. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> killed seven people and caused an estimated $ 725 million in damage. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> leaves, broken limbs and logs from felled trees still line streets and boulevards throughout the region known as the Lowcountry. In places, branches are piled so high they block the view of houses from the street. In low-lying areas and on the coastal barrier islands flooded by the storm, damaged refrigerators, washing machines and clothes dryers litter the landscape. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, lumber and sections of metal roofing clutter sidewalks. The federal government agreed last week to pay for removing the debris, saving state and local governments as much as $ 50 million. `` Our goal is that we would want to have and expect everything to be picked up within two weeks,'' before cooler, dry weather turns the debris into a fire hazard, the mayor said. In the inland counties of <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clarendon </PERSON>, landfills near capacity before the storm are overflowing with garbage and debris, fallen trees and food that spoiled during widespread power outages. `` The county landfill ... had a thimbleful of space to begin with,'' Lee County Administrator <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said. `` We're in big trouble now.'' Tons of debris also caused problems in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` It's just everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, county manager of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> Meanwhile, 6,048 federally supported storm cleanup jobs are still available, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the disaster coordinating officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Some 270,000 people lost jobs because of the storm, `` but very few people have shown an interest in accepting those jobs,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. He said the positions pay more than the minimum wage, but he did not know how much. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> office, said he believed hurricane victims are still more concerned with securing electricity, food and housing than with temporary jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> announced that only two emergency shelters housing 199 people remained in operation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At one point, 453 shelters housed 87,230 people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The number of meals the agency is serving has also dropped. On Sunday, 9,216 meals were served, down from 13,909 meals served Saturday, spokeswoman <PERSON> Georgeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Antarctica Meeting Opens With Calls for Nature Reserve</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> opened an international conference about <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> on Monday by urging that the continent be preserved as a wilderness and site of scientific research. The proposal joined <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with many environmental groups opposed to the view of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which seeks controlled use of the remote continent's vast mineral resources. `` The Antarctic is at the heart of the debate on the environment,'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told delegates from 39 nations which signed the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. Delegates to the 10-day <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting will review the treaty, which preserved the vast, icy continent as a place for peaceful scientific cooperation. Representatives of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of 200 environmental groups, said Monday negotiations should be held on establishing the first World Park, or international wilderness reserve, on the continent's 5.5 million square miles. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, prime minister of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, announced in August they would sponsor a proposal to designate <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> a protected, international wilderness park. Such a reserve would permanently ban mineral exploitation and control all forms of human activity on the continent, which is twice the size of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and almost entirely encased in ice. The French premier said the proposal is rooted in a fundamental belief in the `` right of future generations to inherit from us a planet that is still fit to live in.'' It has gained support from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other countries. Leading the other side are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which back the <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> Convention, a 1988 accord that is six nations short of the required unanimous approval of the 39 <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> members. It seeks to protect the environment by allowing mineral exploitation under strict controls. Its supporters argue that a legal framework regulating mining is better than the voluntary moratorium that has existed until now. The minerals accord also `` establishes environmental principles which are very important,'' said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, in an interview before the conference. However, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told delegates that <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s `` purity is such that it is an irreplaceable site for observing the ozone layer and the changes taking place in the atmosphere.'' In August, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> team reported the ozone hole over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> was much larger than previously believed. Their work raised questions about whether the world's protective ozone layer was disintegrating more rapidly than believed earlier, exposing human beings to dangerous radiation. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> called on delegates to hold a special meeting next year to `` work on a comprehensive program for protecting <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> which, in my view, should take the form of a nature reserve.'' At a news conference after <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, the French underwater explorer, said President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had asked him to help develop the French position on <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, who has collected more than 1 million signatures on a petition to declare <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> a world park, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` wasting its time defending a lost cause'' in arguing for mineral exploitation. Earlier in the day, at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> studios of the American network <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> refused to yield his seat to <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, preventing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate from presenting the American view on the `` Today'' show. During their meetings, the delegates will discuss controlling hazardous waste, extending areas designated for special protection, and developing a plan for dealing with oil spills.

 Following is the English-language text of the account on Monday by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, distributed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, of what <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported was an alien landing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It bore the following headline: ` Confirmed UFO Landing in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, Witnesses Frightened. <LOCATION> VORONEZH </LOCATION> _ Scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying object recently landed in a park in the Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. They have also identified the landing site and found traces of aliens who made a short promenade about the park. Aliens visited the place after dark, at least three times, locals report. A large shining ball or disk was seen hovering above the park, it then landed, a hatch opened and one, two or three creatures similar to humans and a small robot came out. The aliens were three or even four meters tall -LRB- just under 10 feet to slightly more than 13 feet high -RRB-, but with very small heads, witnesses say. They walked near the ball or disc and then disappeared inside. Onlookers were overwhelmed with a fear which lasted for several days. `` We identified the landing site by means of biolocation,'' <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Voronezh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. `` We detected a circle 20 meters in diameter. Four 4-to-5-centimeter deep dents, each with a diameter of 14 to 16 centimeters were clearly visible. They are situated in the four points of a rhomb. We found two mysterious pieces of rock.'' -LRB- A centimeter is 0.4 inches and one meter equals 3.3 feet -RRB-. `` At first glance they looked like sandstone of a deep-red color. However, mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance can not be found on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. However, additional tests are needed to reach a more definite conclusion.'' <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> used biolocation to trace the earthly trails of the aliens. Witnesses were not informed about the experiment, but the route along which the aliens walked as described by the onlookers and the one established scientifically coincided. Many also claim to have seen a banana-shaped object in the sky and a characteristic illuminated sign, as described in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Saga magazine. It is unlikely that residents of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> could have read the magazine.'

 Namibian police withhold information and deny <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials the right to visit people in detention, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He also said the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> police force, known as SWAPOL, was delaying investigations. `` In many cases they have proceeded very slowly and there is a risk that some of them, including some serious cases of homicide, will not be completed within the transition period, with the result that important and crucial evidence may thus be lost,'' he said. About 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and 500 more are being sent to supervise SWAPOL, trained by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, during a one-year period in which the territory is to gain independence. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> spoke out against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Monday, the beginning of the third week of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Cyprien </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> said free elections scheduled for November in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> give hope the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> can welcome it as an independent nation next year. Namibians are to choose an assembly to write a constitution and organize the first independent government in the territory of 1.3 million people. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawanga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ssemogerere </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> said elements of the Namibian police `` and other South African agents'' threaten the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the Namibian nationalist party known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s legal advisor, was assassinated outside his <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> residence in September and an Irishman who entered the territory from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been detained. N'golo <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>'s death was the result of `` sordid plots'' by South African racists. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report said there was no arrangement for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors to visit detainees at police stations and monitors were not allowed to attend interrogations of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPOL </ORGANIZATION> members accused of offenses. `` On occasion,'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPOL </ORGANIZATION> has failed to inform <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors of its schedule of patrols, making it difficult for supervisors from the U.N. Transition Assistance Group -LRB- UNTAG -RRB- to accompany them, the report said. The secretary-general added: `` Nor has SWAPOL always shared with UNTAG information relevant to the security situation in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, though it has often made unsubstantiated allegations of imminent infiltration by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> combatants from southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group as well as a political party, has fought South African occupation of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1966. More than 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters crossed into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on April 1, prompting days of skirmishes with Namibian police and South African troops. Hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of soldiers and police were reported killed. On two occasions since, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has raised false alarms of impending <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> invasions. `` It is clearly important that security information should be shared with <LOCATION> UNTAG </LOCATION>, in order to prevent any recurrence of disturbing terrorist incidents which have taken place in recent weeks, including a murderous attack on UNTAG locations at <LOCATION> Outjo </LOCATION> on Aug. 10 and the assassination of a leading official of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> -RRB- on Sept. 12,'' Perez de Cuellar reported. He said he had increased the number of police monitors from 500 to 1,500 since April `` in order to deal with complaints received from Namibians who do not wish to address themselves directly'' to the police.

 An attacker pulled up in a car and fatally shot a 28-year-old man in another vehicle Monday, police reported. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Pinochet Retires Deputy Army Commander, 11 Other Generals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> reduced the number of army generals by five Monday, two months before elections for a civilian government to replace his military regime. He retired 12 generals, including deputy army commander <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Zincke </PERSON>, and promoted seven officers to general rank. Chosen to replace <PERSON> Zincke </PERSON> was Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucar </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, now barracks commander for <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the capital. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s changes were part of an annual restructuring of the army leadership. Since losing a referendum Oct. 5, 1988, on extending his rule to 1997, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has reduced the number of generals from 56 to 43. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has been army commander since shortly before the uprising in September 1973 that ousted President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist who died in the coup. The referendum defeat obliged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to schedule the December elections for a civilian government to be inaugurated March 11. Reduction in the number of top officers appears designed to help ease the military's departure from major government posts and its return to the barracks. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 73, has said he will remain as army commander under the new government. The 1980 constitution, written by his administration, allows him and the navy, air force and national police commanders to keep their jobs until 1998.

<HEAD>Boy Killed in Accidental Shooting; May Involve New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 9-year-old accidentally shot and fatally wounded a playmate in what could be the first case involving a new law making adults responsible for letting loaded guns fall into the hands of children. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, 12, of nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, was shot in the abdomen Sunday, police said. The boys had been playing in the 9-year-old's bedroom when the younger boy took a .22 - caliber rifle down from a gun rack to show it to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schauland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schauland </PERSON> said the 9-year-old was holding the gun when it fired. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was rushed to the emergency room at <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and then flown to <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, where he died. <PERSON> Schauland </PERSON> said the detective investigating the incident, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, conferred with the State Attorney's office Monday to decide whether to file charges against the 9-year-old's parents. No decision was expected before Tuesday. The new gun-safety law, which took effect Oct. 1, was passed during a special legislative session last summer after a series of shootings, several of them fatal, by children playing with guns. The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands of children 15 and younger, such as using a trigger lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box. If a child shoots someone as a result of a careless gun owner, the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor and up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine if a minor threatens someone with a gun or displays it in public. There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents and for incidents involving guns taken illegally.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The flight engineer on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141, which crashed on takeoff and killed 14 people in 1988, says he did his job right, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> agrees. But he ca n't find work. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> and the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot says he has n't been able to get a job with another airline since the crash at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> `` I feel that I do need to say something, that I did my job that day,'' <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, 32, said in interviews published Monday. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> was the only member of the plane's three-man flight crew found blameless by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> when it ruled on the accident's cause last month. The board found that `` inadequate cockpit discipline'' by Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and first officer <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> resulted in them failing to properly set the wing flaps before takeoff. The board also blamed a faulty takeoff-warning system that would have alerted the crew to the misaligned flaps, which produce added lift during takeoff and landing. A cockpit recording showed the crew and a flight attendant had talked about non-business matters during the 30 minutes before takeoff, but <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> played a small role in the chatter, mainly sticking to his duties. `` The way the media basically said: The crew did this. The crew said that. The crew joked about this. The crew forgot this. It hurt,'' <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said. `` When I felt all along that I had done my job.'' In July, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> fired all three members of the flight crew and stands by the decision despite the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> finding. The crew intends to appeal, a process that could take several years. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> has applied for jobs at other major airlines, but none called him back, he said. `` I'm pretty confident that if I'm not reinstated -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, my airline career is ruined,'' <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said. Shortly after the accident, <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>'s commander at the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in Grand Prairie said he could come back any time, <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said. Three months later, he accepted. He flies on a reserve status about 40 hours per week, shuttling cargo or passengers.

 Four East German refugees were sent home after they entered <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a pro-Solidarity newspaper said Monday. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he could not confirm the report. The number of refugees registered with the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> reached about 500 on Monday, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. If the report on the deportations was true, it would seem to violate assurances reportedly given <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the non-Communist foreign minister, <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON>, that no East German on Polish territory would be sent home against his will. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniakowski </PERSON>, deputy government spokesman, said it appeared such incidents had occurred. He said the matter was being brought to the attention of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wozniakowski </PERSON> said returning refugees to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be justified on purely legal grounds, but he expected <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> would take a `` human rights'' approach. <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Solidarity paper, said the four East Germans were asked for their documents at <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and were sent back when they could not produce the exit permits issued by East German authorities to legal travelers to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadlinski </PERSON> said Monday that, as far as he knew, border troops returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> only those people apprehended in the border zone while still trying to enter <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> report, he said: `` I personally have not heard of such incidents.'' Solidarity parliamentary leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, asked if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should give a right of asylum to all East Germans fleeing their country, said `` the same values and freedoms we fight for should be present in Polish foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said he supported the previously employed solution to the question of refugees in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Two East German trains carrying more than 1,400 refugees were allowed to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last week for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Human rights and international conventions'' governing free movement of refugees should be the first consideration, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. Since the last train left Thursday night, up to 400 new refugees have reached the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including about 40 new arrivals Monday. Roman Catholic church groups, charitable organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> are helping care for the refugees, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` By providing accomodation, food and clothers, if needed, we are granting strictly humanitarian aid,'' the Red Cross general secretary, <PERSON> Izabela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfeter </PERSON>, told the agency. She said it was cooperating with the West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said Friday that 407 East Germans trying to enter <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> illegally were turned back at the border by Polish border guards. Unlike <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has not demanded that the East Germans in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> remain on West German embassy grounds. It even has helped shelter them in vacation hotels on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Police Search for Attackers of Jewish Students</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investigators spent Monday's solemn Jewish holiday of <LOCATION> Yom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kippur </LOCATION> canvassing a neighborhood where three <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> college students were severely beaten by up to 20 young people who shouted anti-Semitic slurs. No arrests had been made in the case, but Inspector <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> said, `` We have good leads.'' `` What's holding us back at this point is that it is a high Jewish holiday,'' said <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, commanding officer of the police department's Bias Incident Investigating Squad. `` The people who could assist us are not available.'' The attackers were described as white men in their late teens and early 20s. The attack in the heavily Jewish <LOCATION> Midwood </LOCATION> section was the most vicious of the 107 anti-Semitic incidents reported in the city so far this year, said <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>. `` What you're talking about is two teen-agers, one of whom had his skull fractured, the other of whom has a broken leg. These are certainly serious injuries,'' <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> said. The third student refused treatment. The three <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students were attacked with fists, feet and beer bottles early Sunday when they emerged from a party at the <ORGANIZATION> Hillel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Jewish student center, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubler </PERSON>. Some witnesses told police the gang had come from a nearby bar, known as a gathering place for area toughs. The motive for the attack appeared to be ethnic hatred, police said. `` If you're looking for logic, forget about it,'' said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity. During the first nine months of this year, there were 107 reported bias crimes against synagogues, Jewish people, yeshivas and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> businesses and residences, compared to 105 reports of similar crimes during the same period last year, <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> said.

 Israeli soldiers opened fire Monday on masked Arabs who were marching with outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, killing one of them. It was the second fatal shooting in as many days in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest town, and occurred during an army curfew imposed on the 120,000 residents. Earlier Monday, three soldiers were injured when an assailant hurled a firebomb at their patrol in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. One soldier suffered moderate wounds, and two sustained minor injuries, the army said. Also Monday, a 5-year-old Palestinian girl, <PERSON> Ulfat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassar </PERSON>, was shot in the head when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops clashed with stone-throwing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demonstrators in the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp northwest of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Doctors at <LOCATION> Rafidya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said she was in `` extremely critical condition.'' In an interview broadcast Sunday by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the army chief of staff, said the army could not end the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising by itself. `` No doubt that this type of popular uprising, no matter where it occurs, happens from motivation that is impossible to end in one action,'' he said. `` It is a long process. There is no such thing as a military solution.'' The violence came as Jews marked Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, with fasting and prayers. The holiday, <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest, ended at sundown Shops and businesses were closed in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to mark the start of the 23rd month of the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The general strike was to continue Tuesday, the fourth and final day of a series of closures called by the underground leadership of the uprising in sympathy with residents of the town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and tax collectors have raided shops and homes in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, for more than two weeks because of an Arab boycott of taxes. Residents say more than $ 750,000 worth of furniture and machinery has been confiscated. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, about a dozen Palestinian men were marching near the <ORGANIZATION> Najar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus when an army patrol spotted them and gave chase, the army said. Witnesses said when the demonstrators failed to stop, the soldiers opened fire, killing one of the Palestinians. The army identified the victim as <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Habash </PERSON>, 22. Earlier, the army spokesman's office earlier confirmed soldiers shot and killed a masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> on Sunday who was among a group demonstrating in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> central market. The spokesman, who can not be identified by name under military rules, said some of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were armed with swords or knives. He said troops opened fire when the Palestinians failed to respond to shouts and warning shots. Arab reports identified man killed Sunday as <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudhud </PERSON>, 32. The latest deaths raised to 587 the number of Palestinians killed since Arabs launched their uprising in December 1987 against Israeli rule in the territories. Another 127 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents said that after the Sunday shooting, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops fired tear-gas to quell disturbances.

 Solidarity's shipyard workers have built lots of vessels over the years, but they finally will have one they can call their own. The state <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it plans to name a ship under construction `` Solidarnosc'' in honor of the formerly banned trade union led by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> that won legal status again this year, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The ship is scheduled to be completed by December 1991, said the shipping monopoly, based in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. The proposal for the name came from Solidarity members at the shipping company, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Union members first applied to name a ship <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION> in December 1980. But `` due to developments in December 1981, the idea did not come off,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> in reference to the imposition of martial law and subsequent ban on Solidarity. Solidarity was legalized again in April and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, is a Solidarity activist.

 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> refused to concede defeat Monday on the eve of the nation's first legislative action on abortion since a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, despite predictions that nothing will be done. `` I do believe that the debate has already caused victory in my mind in the sense that we're now looking at it -LRB- the fetus -RRB- as part of the human race,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told reporters as a few anti-abortion pickets walked outside the Capitol. The governor called a special session beginning Tuesday to consider restrictions on abortions as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 ruling upholding <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> state restrictions on abortions. Thousands of activists on both sides of the issue flocked to the city for the session, and security was tight Monday. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals include requiring viability tests if women 20 weeks pregnant seek abortions; banning the use of public recources for abortions; expanding the regulations abortion clinics must abide by and requiring physicians to tell women seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses. Legislative leaders have said all summer that there's little chance of any of the governor's objectives making it through committees. And the anti-abortion movement suffered a defeat last week when the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down a 1988 parental consent law, ruling it violated a privacy clause in the state Constitution. The heads of key committees have said new abortion regulations would not make it to the floor. Senate President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said he had assured anti-abortion forces only that proposals for greater regulations would get a fair hearing, not that they would go to the floor. A couple of lawmakers have had body guards assigned to them, according to <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. Earlier Monday, a national pro-choice official accused <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of `` playing politics'' with women's lives. `` Tomorrow will be judgment day in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` What happens here will resonate in every corner of this nation.'' `` For Governor <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, this special session will be a crashing disappointment and a major political embarrassment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Her comments were echoed at a news conference later by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>. They called the legislative an exercise in futility. <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, for attempting to impose his religious views on abortion on the rest of the state.

 Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched and shouted `` We Need Freedom!'' in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday during the largest pro-democracy rally in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since a 1953 workers' uprising, witnesses said Protesters also held a vigil in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to demand democratic reforms after a weekend of demonstrations across this hard-line Communist nation. On Saturday and Sunday, clashes broke out between police and demonstrators with hundreds arrested, several injuries, and one death reported by news organizations and witnesses. The government has issued no official toll. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonneberger </PERSON>, pastor for the <ORGANIZATION> Lukas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said `` at least'' 70,000 demonstrators marched in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday night. <PERSON> Wonneberger </PERSON> said he was surprised by the restraint of police and paramilitary troops who were deployed nearby. `` Even though this demonstration is the largest -LRB- since 1953 -RRB-, to our knowledge it went off completely without violence,'' he said in a telephone interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network. In 1953, Soviet forces crushed a workers' uprising. Some <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> demonstrators even `` began conversations with paramilitary troops'' after the crowd started dispersing by mid-evening, <PERSON> Wonneberger </PERSON> said. He said, `` I consider this -LRB- police restraint -RRB- a very hopeful sign following the violence'' in earlier demonstrations. Police clubbed pro-democracy protesters in six East German cities over the weekend and an opposition leader said that unless the government eases its policies, violence may increase. Before the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> march, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Leipzig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> promised publicly they would push for an open dialogue between citizens and the government, church sources said. In a public statement, the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> party officials said, `` We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue socialism in our nation,'' according to the church sources. The country's communist leadership celebrated <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary over the weekend with a visit by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and declared it would not change its tough stand <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other Western countries have also pressed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in past months to make reforms to stem a wave of refugees heading to the West. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday, the protesters marched after attending a traditional Monday evening prayer service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicholas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, witnesses said. Throngs of people joined them along the way, they said. Among their slogans, the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> protesters on Monday shouted `` Democracy!'' and `` No violence!'' said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A larger number of police officers did not stop the march but cordoned off the downtown area, the witnesses said. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television said armored personnel carriers also were seen in the area. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, several thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for the pro-democracy vigil, West German media reported. `` Police have shown restraint so far,'' radio and television said. Earlier Monday, 18 <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders issued an appeal in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> calling on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s government to approve broad democratic reforms and urging all sides to refrain from violence. The Rev. <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>, an opposition leader and <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> pastor in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said Monday on <ORGANIZATION> RIAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the doctrinaire regime must `` talk with the people about their wishes and needs'' or violence may rise. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television said many of the hundreds arrested during the weekend protests already had been sentenced to jail terms of up to six months. Church sources said a participant in a demonstration last week was run over by a train and lost both his legs. <PERSON> Saechsische </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>, a government daily in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, has said a person was `` seriously injured'' when thousands of people tried to board freedom trains that passed through <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> carrying East German refugees from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to the West. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s government protested police harassment of journalists covering the weekend protests. Police broke several cameras and ordered some photographers and television crews out of the country. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> denounced the East German government Monday as `` rigidly authoritarian.'' Up to 15,000 pro-democracy activists held a sit-in Sunday evening in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and thousands of others protested in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jena </PERSON>, Plauen and <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> over the weekend. Witnesses said police used dogs and clubs to disperse peaceful demonstrators. <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth newspaper, said the `` gang of Western news reporters'' stirred up the protests. Tens of thousands of East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent weeks in the largest exodus since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> was built in 1961. Many of those remaining hope <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will persuade their government to undertake political and economic reforms.

<HEAD>Protesters Get Their Way: No More `Evil' in Medieval Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A local charitable organization canceled plans Monday to hold a medieval festival after fundamentalist Christians protested the `` evil'' implications of the Friday the 13th event. `` For the greater good we thought we would just accommodate them,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, an organization volunteer for the <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> chapter of the American Cancer Society. The festival, originally intended to feature tarot card and astrology readings, was changed to a general costume ball. `` It's crazy,'' said psychic <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, the fair's honorary chairwoman. `` It's a misinterpretation of the period of history. We're just trying to do something good. It's a fund-raiser.'' But protesters said they found more than the date and its featured events ominous, claiming mystic references in fliers advertising the festival. `` Tarot card readings or fortune-telling or things like that would bring in spiritual forces that are very dangerous,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Members of the church also protested such things as Life magazine's cover featuring a woman wearing a bra. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said some protesters also objected to the word medieval, believing its ending sounded `` evil.'' The idea of the fair was objectionable, not just the scheduled events, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Maranatha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Ballston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION>. `` It sure would, because of the evil spirits. You're getting into the spirit realm and the devil,'' he said. `` We're certainly against it.'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said he was not sure why the protesters had singled out Friday's function since similar events held in the area had not been targeted in the past. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, organizer of the <ORGANIZATION> Medieval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faire </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, also set for Friday, said her organization had heard no protests.

<HEAD>Papandreou Fails in Bid to Form Greek Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> failed Monday to persuade other leftist forces to join his socialist camp in a coalition government. The collapse of that effort means Greeks face new general elections in November, only five months after the last voting. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> on Monday he had failed in his three-day presidential mandate for form a new government. Emerging from the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, the 70-year-old <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> told reporters he outlined proposals of his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in a memorandum to the president. However, he did not elaborate. Later in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> was summoned to the presidential palace, but he declined to try to put together a government. The political crisis stems from the elections June 18, when no party won a majority in parliament. Conservatives and leftists banded together in an unusual alliance to press forward legal action against socialist officials accused of corruption, including <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> himself. However, the alliance said it would govern only temporarily, and its government stepped down after three months. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> has agreed to remain caretaker until a new government is formed. He too has rejected a presidential mandate to try to form a government, saying he wanted to `` quickly clear any obstacles to elections'' on Nov. 5. Parliament has accused <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of corruption in connection with a $ 210 million embezzlement scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> and with purported wiretapping of political friends and enemies. Lawmakers last month sent <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s case to special courts. They are scheduled to convene within 60 days to try him along with several ex-ministers. If found guilty, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> could receive up to 20 years in prison.

 It was a close encounter of the communist kind. Towering, tiny-headed humanoids from outer space landed their UFO in the Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> and emerged for a promenade around the park, spreading fear among residents. At least that's what the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, contributing to a string of weird tales that have crept into the formerly stuffy state-controlled media in recent months, said in a straight-faced report that Soviet scientists vouched for the UFO's landing. `` Scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying object recently landed in a park in the Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They have also identified the landing site and found traces of aliens who made a short promenade about the park.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> duty officer, contacted Monday evening by telephone, refused to identify the reporter who sent the dispatch from <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, but stood by the story. `` It is not April Fool's today,'' he said. The Soviet media, unleashed by the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of glasnost _ greater openness _ feel free now to hype incredible stories that seem more at home in the supermarket tabloids of the West. Recent examples include other accounts of UFOs, sightings of abominable snowman-type creatures and a tale about a young mystic who goes into a trance and flies about the cosmos. A rash of mystics and ESP-artists also have invaded state TV. In <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, commented: `` We're extremely skeptical of this claim. It's not the first one -LRB- in the Soviet media -RRB-. There's many. There seems to be a rash of reports, largely uncorroborated.'' According to Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, a large shining ball or disk was seen hovering over the park by <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> residents. They saw the UFO land and up to three creatures similar to humans emerge, accompanied by a small robot, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The aliens were three or even four meters tall -LRB- almost 10 feet to 13 feet -RRB-, but with very small heads,'' the news agency quoted witnesses as saying. `` They walked near the ball or disc and then disappeared inside.'' The report resembled a story last summer in the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, which carried an alleged `` close encounter'' between a milkmaid and an alien in Central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> region. In that report, milkmaid <PERSON> Lyubov </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was quoted as saying she encountered an alien creature `` resembling a man, but taller than average with short legs.'' The creature, she said, had `` only a small knob instead of a head.'' <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a consultant who lectures on the topic `` Flying Saucers Are Real'' and has examined Soviet studies of UFOs, said in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on Monday that Soviet scientists tended to treat the subject more seriously than American scientists. Last June, the Soviet publication <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> included an article on `` UFO's and Security.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, which did not give the date of the purported `` landing'' in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, said onlookers were `` overwhelmed with a fear that lasted for several days.'' <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Voronezh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that scientists investigating the UFO report found a 20-yard depression with four deep dents, as well as two pieces of unidentified rocks. `` At first glance, they looked like sandstone of a deep-red color. However, mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance can not be found on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> as saying. `` However, additional tests are needed to reach a more definite conclusion,'' he said. <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> said the landing site and path taken by the aliens was confirmed using the `` biolocation'' method of tracking. The agency did not explain what that was. Further confirmation came from witnesses in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, who were not told of the experiments and whose accounts coincided precisely with the scientific findings, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In July, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> deflated a report in <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> quoting a UFO specialist, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzovkin </PERSON>, as saying a 26-foot-wide patch of burned ground near southern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was probably caused by the landing of a UFO. Not so, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Firefighters think a haystack simply caught fire and scorched the ground. Russians have long been fascinated by the weird and the occult, but formerly they could glean their information only from rumors and underground copies of everything from palmistry guides to books on Eastern mysticism. The Kremlin's economic reforms, with their emphasis on each enterprise paying its own way, have also given the official press more incentive to cater to readers' tastes in order to increase circulation. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>'s committee has a UFO subcommittee and has been investigating the claim made by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, a professor of philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, said Monday: `` Since the press freedoms in the last year, increasingly it seems to be open season. Paranormal pandemonium has broken out in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, not only with UFOs, but faith healers, astrologers and so on. In a closed society such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, you do n't get the development of critical reason.'' He said the account `` has all the characteristics of science fiction.'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> noted that scientist <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> says the landing was confirmed by biolocation _ `` As far as we can tell it's a kind of dowsing. We're very questioning of that. It's hardly a scientific method of testing whether anything's landed or not.'' `` If this were true,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> remarked, `` I think chairman -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mikhail </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would call a press conference and proudly announce that, with everybody attempting to get out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, at long last here are some extraterrestrials in that Union.''

From 11 a.m. on we were just packed,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON>, whose family owns <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s, a popular joint filled with giant screen TVs and dozens of smaller monitors. `` Everybody is just amazed that the dream came true; that it's the A's and <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said `` It's a once in a lifetime thing. We're all as happy as we could be. No one's going to lose. We've already won with the Bay Bridge Series. He said A's fans had been rooting for the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and vice versa all weekend. The last time a World Series was played in one metropolitan area was 1956, when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> in seven games. As soon as the game at Candlestick ended, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police reported crowds pouring into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where Columbus Day celebrations were under way in the predominantly <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> neighborhood. Nighttime revelry along <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'s Broadway is traditional after a major victory for a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> sports team. At <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>'s on Geary Street, about 150 young people were ecstatic about the Bay Bridge Series. `` If you asked me, in my wildest dreams, if there would be a Bay Bridge World Series, I'd tell you you're nuts,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, who said he has attended <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> games for a decade. At the ballpark, fan <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> shouted: `` Fantastic! Incredible!'' Despite the jubilation, there was no concensus about the outcome. `` Heart's going to win the series and the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> have a lot of heart,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>'s. `` The A's in five,'' retorted another fan who added: `` The A's have the pitching, the A's have <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and the A's have the power. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, bartender at Brew Pub on the Green in Fremont, said the rivalry between A's and <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> fans is going to be `` hard, maybe impossible to contain, maybe even a little dangerous. Everybody's getting pretty rowdy.'' The bar's patrons generally are evenly divided on the teams because of its location, 20 miles to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and an equal distance to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a tranditional stronghold of <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> fans. He expects the bar to cordon off areas for each team to keep the fans separate. <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>'s patrons included at least one lonely Cubs fan, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurstik </PERSON>, a former Chicagoan now living in Grand Junction, Colo. He stood by quietly as the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> partisans whooped it up. `` There's always next year; we'll get another pitcher from somewhere.''

 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> drew a marathon 116-move battle with <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the resumed fourth round game of the World Chess Championship Candidate semifinal Monday to retain his one point lead. The two had played the fifth game of eight on Sunday and <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> now leads 3-2. A win scores one point and a draw a half. Play was adjourned after six hours play Saturday night when <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> sealed his 64th move in a position well known as a technical draw, but where <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> could test <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>'s defensive technique for many moves. But <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, well-primed after overnight analysis of the position, rattled off his moves on Monday until <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> gave up and offered a draw on the 116th move. The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in a 24-game contest beginning in October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the Candidates' final next March. In the other semifinal, former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> leads fellow Soviet <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> 2.5-1 .5 after four games The Soviets are one game behind because <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> took a timeout on Sunday postponing his fifth game with <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> until Tuesday. The sixth game between <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> is also scheduled for Tuesday. If either match ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be played, followed if necessary by sudden-death tiebreakers.

 Leftist guerrillas killed a political candidate's driver Monday and insurgents from another group kidnapped a rancher in the country's latest outbreak of rebel attacks, authorities said. Police said three Maoist Shining Path rebels killed the chauffeur of the mayoral candidate Monday in <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. They said the candidate, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Fredemo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was not in his car when the rebels sprayed it with gunfire. A bodyguard was also wounded, authorities said. Shining Path rebels have assassinated 50 mayors the past five years. They are now seeking to disrupt municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12. The group began its armed insurgency against <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government in 1980. Authorities also said rebels of the pro-Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped rancher <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zender </PERSON> from his home after setting fire to the Iscozasin town hall, about 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The rebels left a note for <PERSON> Zender </PERSON>'s family demanding $ 100,000 in ransom. The Tupac Amaru group operates separately from the Shining Path. It took up arms in 1984 and has mostly engaged in urban attacks against government and business targets. The government says more than 15,000 people have died during nine years of rebel violence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official's accusation that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is conniving with activists in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to overthrow <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government. The Chinese army's attacks on pro-democracy students in June, which left hundreds dead, `` are the cause of the loss of confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman. The British colony is scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. `` As for the view that we have connived at acts of sabotage in an attempt to overthrow the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, that is quite wrong,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> attach great importance to democratic freedoms, under their own legal system,'' he said. `` Equally it is important that such freedoms are used with a sense of responsibility. `` There is no evidence that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is used as a base for activities against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government.

 The stench of rotting rats drove a group of public defenders from their office trailer in February and they're still homeless because no one will rent them space. The attorneys say landlords near <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> do n't want them as tenants because they do n't want a steady stream of criminal defendants in their buildings. `` Most of the people seem to have the idea that with us come the riffraff of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. That's just not the case,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, the senior deputy public defender who shut down the old offices because of the stink. The court's presiding judge, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Iles </PERSON>, said the public defenders' clientele is by and large not dangerous. `` They are indigent and they deserve attorneys just like people with money,'' she said. The defenders represent 350 people a month. They have long needed more space, but the crunch became a crisis when a county pest extermination effort left the old trailer's walls and floors filled with decaying rat remains. For the time being, the defenders work out of a tiny temporary trailer and a meeting room at a library down the hill from the court. Files and law books are stored at the courthouse. `` At this point the rats are starting to look good,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, the county's chief deputy public defender. The solution appears to be a plan to add a two-story building at South Court. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, an analyst for the county administrative office, will pitch the idea to the county Board of Supervisors in several weeks.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was in an uproar Monday over whether President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> explored a possible truce with the cocaine cartels, even as new raids were reported in <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION>'s declared war on drug traffickers Authorities raided five cocaine laboratories along the <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Narino </LOCATION> state, arrested eight people and destroyed a ton of coca leaves used to make the drug, the national radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing the commander of the state's antinarcotics police as its source Police also reportedly seized weapons as well as coca seeds and chemicals used in processing cocaine. With the president's credibility at stake in his war on drugs, former Interior Minister <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> confirmed in published reports Sunday that he acted as a go-between in truce negotiations between the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday revealed <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>'s role in the alleged negotiations and the 76-year-old <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> confirmed that role in interviews published Sunday by <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspapers <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> reportedly said there were never any direct negotiations and the subject was approached only through intermediaries. He was quoted as saying the government did not discourage the contacts that started in September 1988 and ended almost a year later. The contact roles were played by a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> lawyer representing the traffickers; <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> as the messenger; and <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s general secretary, <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, who fielded the messages, <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> had said such negotiations would be possible only if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other cocaine-consuming countries agreed to participate, the papers quoted <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> as saying. They quoted <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's strong opposition to any dealings with the drug lords made direct negotiations impossible. `` Since the program of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been to fight drugs militarily, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government had big problems convincing the administration to accept the arrangement,'' <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said, according to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>. `` This is going to generate a huge national debate,'' <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> senator, as saying. `` It seems to me that the government continues to handle matters with a double morality.'' <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said in a communique Saturday night that he had not negotiated with traffickers and vehemently denied the La Prensa account. He said his decision to meet with <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> was a personal one and that he told <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> negotiations with the drug traffickers was not possible. Memos and other documents about the purported contacts were delivered to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> senator. He was quoted as saying in an interview published Sunday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> that he wondered if the Barco administration `` tricked everyone'' by negotiating with traffickers while maintaining a hard-line public stance against them. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> unleashed a campaign against traffickers Aug. 19, one day after Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate, was killed, ostensibly by hitmen hired by drug traffickers. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said repeatedly since the crackdown began that he will never negotiate with the drug lords. Traffickers reacted to the government declaration of war against them with a bombing campaign.

<TEXT>
 The ruling Hungarian communist party that earlier changed its name and embraced democratic aspirations elected the centrist leader of the old party on Monday to head a slate of reformers in the new one. <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was the first to congratulate him. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> conducts very fast diplomacy,'' a tired but elated <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said. `` They gave me his telegram within two hours of my election.'' He was named president in closed session after key reformists reluctantly shelved some of their reservations about him to avoid a possible split. Spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> told state TV the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> also elected a 25-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the new party's executive leadership and successor of the communist party Politburo. Delegates said reformists <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, members of the old party's collective leadership, were among the 25. They were not picked as deputies to <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, however, in a new indication of resistance to too much radical reformist influence. The new party's statutes provide for two vice presidents, but <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> told reporters, `` The congress could not agree on choices for these positions.'' A copy of the <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> list given to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> contained names of reformers only, including some former Politburo members such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. Missing were Politburo members considered less enthusiatic about reform, including party spokesman <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON>. Politburo member <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, the most conservative of the old party's collective leadership, also was not elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but said beforehand he would not seek a senior post. The clearly reformist makeup of the executive body was expected to gratify some liberals unhappy with the choice of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, former chairman of the communist party. Delegate <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerekes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> won the support of 86 percent of those present, and <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON> said from 70 to 80 percent voted for the <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> list. The congress opened Friday and ended early Tuesday with the more than 1,200 delegates approving the following resolutions _ all watered-down versions of what radical reformers wanted: _ Start of discussions in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about the fate of party-controlled assets accrued illegally during its predecessor's 41 years in _ Informal support of the largely volunteer Workers' Militia, now facing dissolution, if it decides to give up its paramilitary character and become an emergency aid organization during fires, floods and other catastrophes _ Declaration of Oct. 23, start of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising, as a Day of National Reconciliation On Saturday, the congress laid the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party to rest and founded the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a vote without parallel in the Soviet bloc. That opens the way for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first free national elections in 41 years. Founding documents described the new party as having Euro-Communist and democratic Socialist leanings, committed to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy. But in an attempt to compromise, the congress rejected radical reformers' demands that die-hard Marxists be expressly shut out. It instead stipulated that all accepting the new party's orientation in writing could become members. The new party's formation was the latest bold reform in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, whose democratic strivings have placed it, along with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in the vanguard of change in the Soviet bloc. In the show-of-hands vote, delegates overwhelmingly approved strivings for `` a constitutional state based on a multiparty system, where the source of power is the will of the people expressed in free elections.'' The party was described as `` an organization in the Marxist spirit ... totally committed to democracy.'' Despite this, reformist delegates have expressed worry that the new party did not differ enough from its predecessor, and the choice of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was expected to heighten anxieties among some wanting a clean break with the past. Serious ideological rifts emerged among the three leading candidates in the collective leadership prior to the secret vote. But <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, said earlier to be siding with <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> against <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, told reporters as he went into the congress hall for the vote that `` the danger of a split has been averted.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> also emphasized the will to compromise in an interview after the vote for <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>. `` Everybody agrees on the basics, and one thing I can tell you is that the reformers are in the majority,'' he said. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> repeated after the election that there would be no purge. The congress on Sunday voted to continue party politics at factories and work shops. The conservative Marxist Unity Platform issued a statement Monday saying the old party remained functional and urging true communists not to join the new one.

<HEAD>German Parts Could Be Used in Libyan Missiles, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The West German company Globe-Sat has been fined for selling valve control parts to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that could be used to build missiles, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> chief state prosecutor <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> said Monday. He said the Munich-based firm appealed the fine, which followed a ruling this year that the shipments violated West German export laws. <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> called the fine `` large'' but declined to give a figure. No date has been set for the appeal hearing, he said. <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> was asked about a report in the British weekly Sunday Correspondent. It said about 100 West German engineers are helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a missile capable of carrying chemical warheads and with a range of 300 to 450 miles in a camp about 60 miles from the Saharan oasis of Sabha. <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the possibility of illegal German involvement has been under investigation since last spring. He would not elaborate. The Sunday Correspondent said radical Libyan leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> ultimately wants to develop a missile with a 1,000-mile range that would allow him to threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Involvement of West German firms in a Libyan chemical plant embarrassed the government of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> this year when charges surfaced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the plant was meant to produce chemical arms. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is intended to make pharmaceutical products.

 A federal jury Monday convicted a man on 19 counts for the planting of 13 bombs in nearby <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, a plot prosecutors said was rooted in his lifelong rivalry with a state legislator. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated just over three hours before returning the guilty verdicts against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, unexpectedly rested his case Monday afternoon without calling witnesses. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, was charged with 29 counts including conspiracy, illegal possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making bombs and 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges and buildings used in interstate commerce. No bombs actually exploded. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> began to weep before the jury returned to the courtroom and his family members cried as the verdicts were announced. `` We love you and still believe in you,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Opal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, told her son as he was led out of the courtroom. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> turned to her and said, `` Let the world know.'' On his way out of the courthouse, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> told reporters, `` I know I'm innocent; God knows I'm innocent.'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said he was not certain whether the case will be appealed. No sentencing date was set. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> has been in custody since his arrest in May. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 42, one of <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s co-workers at a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> factory, was convicted on all 29 counts following a trial last month. <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> in in south-central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. In closing arguments Monday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> described <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> as a `` guerrilla fighter in his own mind.'' `` He wanted the thrill of being able to see the fear and the panic on people's faces about the bombs and the chaos he had created in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> was motivated by his lifelong rivalry and hatred for state Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. `` He resented him for a lifetime of accomplishments that he thought <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had that Mr. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> did n't,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> contended it was absurd to suggest <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> would plant a bomb within 150 feet of his own house and then return home to his wife and children to `` wait to be blown off the face of the earth because he did n't get a part in a school play in high school.'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said the government's case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence, much of it provided by `` purchased testimony.'' Government witnesses included a paid informant, who was a convicted felon, and an inmate who met <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> when both were at the Marion County Jail. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> told jurors <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> had continued to deny involvement in the bomb case. He characterized any boastful statements <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> made as `` the meanderings of a drunk. That's pretty clear.'' The defense attorney described <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> as a `` gun nut who loads his own ammunition, who has weird politics. We know he exaggerates; we know that when he's drunk, he lies,'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> eventually will replace the military editors of the armed services newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> and Stripes with civilians, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday. The development follows a recommendation made last year in a study by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that said it found evidence of censorship and improper management at the government-run daily. `` When the current military editors retire, it is our intention to put civilians in there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who said he could n't give a specific time for the change, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also was `` looking into'' the possible financial and editorial consolidation of the newspaper's two editions. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the switch was expected to occur within several years. Both the European and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> editions of Stars and Stripes, originally designed to serve as a hometown paper for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces overseas, have been plagued in recent years by allegations of censorship and employee harassment. A Pentagon-appointed ombudsman has been in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> for two weeks looking into the allegations. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, was named to the new ombudsman position last summer. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, reported last year that it found evidence of censorship and improper management. The agency also said the editor-in-chief should be a civilian with solid journalism credentials. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in the defense authorization bill report for fiscal 1990, agreed that the editor should have solid journalistic credentials but stopped short of calling for a civilian. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation was launched last year at the request of then-Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` The good news is for the thousands of military personnel and their dependents overseas, because the credibility of one of their primary sources of news will be greatly enhanced,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON>, national freedom of information chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> and deputy editorial director for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> `` They were trying to serve two masters and it was an impossible duty,'' <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON> said about the military editors. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said a national accounting firm is, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, studying whether the financial consolidation would be beneficial. `` We want to do what is best for the paper. ... We take any allegations of censorship very seriously,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for public affairs. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations prohibit censorship `` unless the military chain of command determines that the information would affect military security or the health and welfare of the troops,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Censorship is not allowed just because some news is embarrassing. The rules are very clear.'' The allegations of censorship and harassment of employees who complained to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have caught the attention of several lawmakers, including Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who last month called the problem an `` intolerable situation. Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and Stripes is published in separate editions by largely autonomous bureaus in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian journalists, but both papers are led by an officer who holds the title commander and editor-in-chief. Those officers report to the heads of the European and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commands </ORGANIZATION>.

In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, our music does n't suit their programming. `` I stil maintain that the public does n't get a hold on it. We're perceived as a slow-ballad band.'' Simply Red's American hits, `` If You Do n't Know Me by Now,'' and `` Holding Back the Years,'' are showcases for <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>'s stunning, soulful vocals. But they tell only half the story. The music of the six-man ensemble bears little resemblance to most contemporary music. Simply Red tackles everything from jazz to soul to pop to reggae and does it extremely well. And <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>'s voice has been compared to everyone from Phoebe Snow to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> The band _ a collection of musicians with backgrounds ranging from pub performer to church organist _ prides itself on working under its own set of rules, far removed from the middle of the road. It's repertoire is filled with funked-up dance songs, some with a left-wing political twist. But <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>, who still lives in blue-collar <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he grew up, finds pop music and politics a natural combination. `` I'm not stupid, and the whole world is full of things that are important,'' <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a few weeks before the band was to play two sold-out shows in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I'm trying to reach out to people who do n't believe everything they read The world does n't revolve around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` If I do write about love, I write the way I feel about it rather than how the rest of the world and public convention would have me feel.'' But <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>, whose first gig was singing at a wedding when he was 6, is more famous for his vocal range than his political views. Critics have a field day speculating on his soul influences _ <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> are two of the favorite guesses _ but he traces his style to the band Burning Spear and singer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Parry </PERSON>. The anti-Thatcherism, he said, comes from four lean years in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> spent scraping by as a deejay. <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON> said he decided his poverty was due partly to his career choice and partly to government policies. The road to success was n't easy for <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>, who started assembling the band in 1984. <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON>, who lent his wide-ranging vocal talents to a punk band called the Frantic Elevators for three years until 1981, was forced to fire some friends as he put together Simply Red. Simply Red, as <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON> points out, is not simply `` Red.'' Drummer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> joined on from the band Durutti Column; guitarist <PERSON> Sylvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was a local jazz player from the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> pubs; keyboardist <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> learned his trade in his father's church; and trumpeter <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellett </PERSON> was clasically trained at a British music academy. The band is currently in the midst of a world tour that has taken them to five continents over six months to promote the new album, `` A New Flame.'' Weary of life on the road, <PERSON> Hucknall </PERSON> plans to return to <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> soon and enjoy a home he bought last year. `` I'm taking a year out to do nothing,'' he said. `` I enjoyed it for awhile, but four years is beginning to be a bit of a drag.''

<HEAD>Japanese Ministry Puts Brakes on Borrowing Words from English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Among the world's languages, Japanese is one of the most eager borrowers of foreign words. But one arm of the bureaucracy is putting on the brakes. Very gently. Please, not `` konseputo'' _ how the Japanese pronounce `` concept.'' Use `` kihonteki kangaekata'' -LRB- basic idea -RRB- instead. And no more `` masuta puran'' -LRB- master plan -RRB-, says the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. Let's say `` kihon keikaku'' -LRB- basic plan -RRB- and more Japanese people will understand. But the ministry's list of English words to be avoided in official documents is accompanied by a list of acceptable ones. It would n't do in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Commissariat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Langue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> battles against the `` Franglais'' that results from unapproved cohabitation with English. If the commissariat ordered `` un bulldozer'' to be pushed aside for `` bouteur,'' the French certainly would never agree with the Japanese ministry's acceptance of `` homu herupa'' for `` home helper'' _ people who help the elderly at home. The Japanese, by the way, would translate the French word `` bouteur'' as `` burudoza.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> issued guidelines on foreign words this past summer because <PERSON> Junichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Koizumi </PERSON>, the minister at the time, felt that many ordinary people would not understand some of the foreign words used in the ministry's jargon, said <PERSON> Masato </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, a senior planning officer. The ministry wants to help people, but `` if they do n't understand what we're saying, then they do n't get help,'' <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> said Borrowed words are written in the katakana script, one of three scripts in the complex Japanese writing system. Used like italics, <LOCATION> katakana </LOCATION> is an angular script in which each symbol is a syllable. A rounded-looking script called hiragana also uses a symbol for each syllable. Though every Japanese word could be written in those two scripts, there is also kanji, or Chinese-style characters. One must know 2,000 or so kanji to be able to read a Japanese newspaper, while the <LOCATION> katakana </LOCATION> and hiragana scripts have about 50 symbols each. In contrast to its wildly rich writing system, spoken Japanese has fewer sounds than English and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> languages _ no L, no TH, no V, a weak F, a low number of consonant combinations. So foreign words often are barely recognizable when adopted into Japanese. `` Needs,'' for instance, is one of the words rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. It is written in <LOCATION> katakana </LOCATION> as either `` needo'' or `` neezu.'' Suggested alternatives are juyo -LRB- demand -RRB- and yobo -LRB- request -RRB-. But Japanese people have been borrowing foreign words for centuries, and many are in common use. Shirt is `` waishatsu'' _ actually from `` white shirt'' _ and it will be found on the laundry list next to the `` terebi'' -LRB- TV -RRB- on the `` teiburu'' -LRB- table -RRB- at your `` hoteru'' -LRB- hotel -RRB-. Not all borrowed words retain their original shape or meaning. `` Handoru'' comes from `` handle'' but means steering wheel. `` Rihabiri'' is a shortened `` rehabilitation.'' Japanese people think of such imports as katakana words because that is the way they're written, said <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON>, a department head at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` Bureaucrats are fond of katakana words, but not so much as people in advertising, sports and high-technology areas. When they speak Japanese, they use English words. They know the Japanese words, but it's easier to use English words.'' <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON> added that many people think foreign words are used too much, but the proliferation continues, especially from American English. He said his institute refrains from taking a position for or against borrowed words. English is another great borrower of foreign words, he noted, `` and that makes the language more powerful, so why should n't we have foreign words.''

<TEXT>
 The bowler hat, enduring symbol of the Englishman, is catching the fancy of Americans. Although it has been disappearing from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district where it once was common, exports of bowlers are growing, particularly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, experts say. `` There's been a marked increase in the number being sold to Americans,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, managing director of the Picadilly hatters <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lock </PERSON> and Co. There is also demand from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where gray bowlers are worn to the horse races, and from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Overall sales are 25 percent higher than in the mid-1980s, with most of the growth coming from foreign sales, <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> said. `` We are selling more,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedford </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Christy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest hat maker. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today, however, bowler-wearers are viewed by some as mildly eccentric. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an 89-year-old insurance underwriter, explained why he has worn one for 65 years. `` They are smart. It used to be when people dressed smartly the proper thing to wear was a bowler. I've just kept on with it.'' Bowlers also are good to grow geraniums in, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> attributes the recent upturn to increased demand for bowlers as riding hats and as women's fashion head wear. `` We have seen some sort of designer ranges in very strong colors with holes cut in them and bells sewed on them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You do see some very odd derivatives.'' Bowlers cost $ 113 to $ 139 each, and Americans are not buying them as a gimmick or for souvenirs, <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> said. `` The vast majority are buying this with every intention of wearing it.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We are really finding in the home market things quieter than we would like.'' Made of rabbit fur hardened with shellac, bowlers still are handcrafted through 47 steps over the course of eight weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> said. The hats date back to 1850, when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coke </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> farmer, asked <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lock </PERSON> to make a hard hat that would protect his gamekeepers from overhead branches while they rode their horses. Lock designed a close-fitting domed hat and had it made by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hatters <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON>. According to bowler lore, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> tried out the hat by jumping on it. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lock </PERSON> has sold the hard hats ever since, calling them Cokes after the first customer. But the Bowler brothers also branched out on their own, and their name stuck. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the hat became known as a derby because it was worn to the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> horse race. In 1880s <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, it became fashionable to wear a bowler in town, and it was popular among lawyers, brokers, and bankers. `` It's particularly associated with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: the pinstriped suit, the rolled umbrella and the bowler hat,'' <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> said. But they also were worn by off-duty army officers and by the foremen of shipyards and mills in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They still are part of the uniform worn on parade by the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> Ireland Protestants. The Duke of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> sometimes wore a bowler, as did <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> wore a square-crowned variation. During the 1920s and 1930s, up to a million bowlers were produced annually in factories around <LOCATION> Stockport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The bowler went into decline after World War II. The spread of cars meant people did n't need hats as much to keep warm, and dress became less formal. After the war, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> bought the failing <ORGANIZATION> Stockport </ORGANIZATION> factories, which altogether employed 3,500 people. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> currently has 350 employees making all kinds of hats, including some 50,000 bowlers a year.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great founded his capital on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast, he intended it to dominate the world. It did, but not through military force as he imagined. <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> dominated through knowledge and culture, and at the heart of its glory was the greatest library in the history of the world. The Library of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> lasted for hundreds of years after the conqueror's death in <LOCATION> Babylon </LOCATION> at age 33 but it disappeared with few traces early in the Christian era. Now, almost 2,000 years later, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is embarking on a project to restore <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>'s cultural prominence by creating a new library as a symbol of where <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s been and where it's going. `` We want others to see <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from the right point of view, as a country of civilization,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorour </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s minister of education, who is heading the project `` We are much more than keepers of the pyramids. We are reviving the concept of the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> ... in order to prove to the world that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s civilization did n't go away but is a living tradition.'' The site is ready and the design chosen for the projected $ 180 million-complex that officials say will bring new life to an old but honored city. The site is prime <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> seafront, backed by the bustle of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. On the horizon is the 10th-century fortress of <LOCATION> Qait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bey </LOCATION>, built where one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pharos Lighthouse, purportedly stood. The design by the Norwegian architectural firm <LOCATION> Snoehetta </LOCATION> is for the new <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> to be a sweeping circle of concrete, steel, glass and stone _ a symbol of the sun If an international fund-raising drive now under way succeeds and the project meets its schedule, the library complex will be completed by 1995. Recapturing ancient glory wo n't be easy, for few cities have a more impressive early history than <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>'s. Founded in 331 B.C., it beckoned the greats of its time, who in turn gave the world a harvest of their best thoughts and inventions: the pipe organ, the Archimedes screw, the atlas and 12-month, 365-day year, grammar and geography, geometry and trigonometry, steam and fire engines, coin-operated machines, city planning, and cataloging. From <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> came news that the Earth revolved around the sun. Alexandrian scholars calculated the circumference of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to within 50 miles and the length of the solar year to within six minutes. Poetry and prose abounded. They emptied from the Athens-Alexandria axis into ports around the world, Greek becoming Roman becoming Western heritage. Alexandrian culture revolved around an academic complex called the Moseion, a think tank for <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> intellectuals with the freedom and the means to create at will. At the heart of the Moseion was the library. Both were thriving by 285 B.C., a half-century before establishment of a second, even greater <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> known to scholars as the daughter library. It eventually contained an estimated 500,000 volumes, a trove so vast 120 parchment scrolls were required to catalog it. The collection included the 200,000 volumes of the Pergamum Library, carted away from what is now <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> by love-smitten <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> as a gift for Cleopatra. Debate continues over the fate of the ancient <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> libraries. Some historians contend they were destroyed during Jewish revolts of A.D. 115-117. Others say Christians who rioted against pagan ways in A.D. 391 destroyed them. There appears little evidence the institutions survived long enough to be destroyed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> invaders hundreds of years later, as many early Western scholars wrote. Whatever happened, the libraries and records about them were so thoroughly demolished that nobody knows for certain what they looked like or even where they stood. The idea to revive the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> was born in 1974. University of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> officials saw it as a way to perpetuate a literary and cultural heritage long associated with their city, still an educational headquarters for more than 80,000 students. They decided the first step would be a new library, but by the time <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s president, laid the cornerstone June 26, 1988, the library had become an academic and social center. It was to include a conference center, a planetarium, a scientists' Hall of Fame, a calligraphy museum and other facilities `` It's unfair for others to look on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> only as a developing country struggling toward its economic development,'' Education Minister <PERSON> Sorour </PERSON> said. `` The West owes much to other cultures, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and later the Arabs.''

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Feminist groups in traditionally Roman Catholic <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> have launched the country's first pro-choice abortion campaign. Though abortion is illegal, except when the mother's life is endangered due to preganancy or in cases of rape, independent researchers say 3 million to 5 million clandestine abortions take place a year. That would make <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> the world's leader, accounting for 4 percent to 7 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of roughly 65 million abortions that take place each year. <PERSON> Ivany </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collective </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> women have been discussing abortion for more than 10 years but never lobbied for legalization. `` Abortion is an extremely delicate issue in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, particularly with the church's influence,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON>, a leader of the pro-choice drive. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 145 million people are listed as Roman Catholics. The pro-choice campaign was officially launched at the 10th National Feminist Meeting in mid-September. The coalition is planning street rallies, a media campaign and public debates and will lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in support of a bill introduced in early September by Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoino </PERSON> of the pro-Marxist <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, calling for the legalization of abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. `` Abortion is a human rights and class question,'' Ms. <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON> said. `` Everyone knows where the clandestine abortion clinics are, including the government, so for upper - and middle-class women it's essentially legal The average cost of an illegal abortion runs from $ 200 to $ 850. But even $ 200 is far beyond the means of the majority of women. `` It's pure hypocrisy,'' <PERSON> Genoino </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is the world champion in abortions. But the law forces poor women to risk their life if they want to terminate their pregnancies.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON>, a sociologist with <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chagas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that about 10,000 women die each year after using crude methods for self-induced abortions, such as knitting needles. His research also indicates that about 200,000 women a year are admitted to public hospitals due to medical problems stemming from self-induced abortions. Feminist groups also complain that in the case of rape, legal requirements are so stringent that few <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> women are able to get abortions on those grounds. Rape victims need reports from the police and the government's <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> confirming a rape occurred A judge then must authorize the abortion. `` By the time all the requirements are met, the child is already in school,'' Ms. <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON> said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> wo n't classify an attack as rape unless the victim has physical injuries and if sperm is found in the vagina. If a woman did not `` resist,'' Brazilian law does not consider rape to have taken place. Only 20 percent of the women who go to the institute claiming they were raped are able to have the crime classified as such, Ms. <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON> claimed. She said few judges will authorize an abortion even if all requirements are met because of personal opposition or fear of negative publicity. In 1987, <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Janeiro </PERSON> became the first city to pass specific legislation implementing the legal-abortion law and two public hospitals were designated to perform abortions on rape victims. The need for a judge's authorization was dropped. But figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed only two women had legal abortions nearly two years after the law went into effect. `` Few women have the courage to admit they were raped,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorreltino </PERSON>, also a member of the Feminist Health Collective. `` They do n't know about the law, or they are unable to prove the attack took place.'' Pro-choice supporters do n't believe legalization of abortion will take place any time soon. <PERSON> Genoino </PERSON> estimated that only 50 of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 570 congressmen will support his bill. But Ms. <PERSON> Buzzo </PERSON> contended, `` A democratic society must grant women the right to bear a child or not. It's going to be a struggle, but ultimately we'll win.''

<HEAD>Jackson to Stay Visible on TV, in Democratic Campaigns</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is an off year for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> so his impact is limited _ he's an issue in one current and one coming campaign, an indirect factor in a couple more, and national Democratic rulemakers have just dealt with a problem he left them. Now he's announced plans to become a television talk show host next fall, just when a lot of people think he may be campaigning for mayor of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't saying yes or no. `` I do not choose to pursue the hypothetical,'' he said in announcing his television plans last week. `` I am not running for any office and at this point have no plans to do so.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wants to go on television with the weekly talk show to break a pattern in which `` fewer and fewer people talk about more and more and often know less and less.'' Then, too, the national forum of a syndicated television program would provide exposure and, in effect, an introduction to voters the two-time Democratic presidential candidate would n't otherwise reach. And that can only add to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> factor in Democratic politics. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> transplanted his <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> political headquarters from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this summer, saying he wanted a base closer to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the federal government. He registered to vote in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Aug. 3, thus qualifying to run for mayor. But he said he would not run against embattled Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, his longtime ally in the civil rights movement. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has said he will seek a fourth term. There will be at least three other Democratic candidates. That confronts the charismatic black leader with the kind of problem that does n't apply at loftier political levels. His statements and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s put things on hold pending further maneuvering. But there has been no hold in the speculation, notably after <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will run for mayor and will win. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, convention manager for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presidential campaign in 1988, said his forecast was n't based on inside information or direct word from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said he doubted anything short of legal proceedings would keep <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> from running again. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been involved in a federal investigation into alleged drug dealing by an associate and former city employee. The mayor has denied any wrongdoing. When that puzzle unravels it could have a national impact. Should <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> become mayor, it could sideline him in what otherwise would be an almost certain third campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> factor also figures in other, more immediate political competition, notably the contest for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Republicans have tried to make an issue of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the black Democrat who won nomination over Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Despite apologies and peace gestures, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 description of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` hymietown'' still rankles among Jewish voters, a vital bloc in a mayoral election there. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s headquarters said he has no firm schedule for campaign appearances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but he is expected to go there for efforts to register and turn out black voters in <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' behalf. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> seeks to become the first black elected governor of any state, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has stayed out of the campaign. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> needs the support of moderate and conservative Democrats to win. With those vital blocs, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s involvement would be counterproductive In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, voters will be choosing between two black candidates for mayor, and while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s allies backed the man who led the primary, the challenger is coming on strong after unexpectedly beating three white candidates to win a spot on the final ballot. At the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting, one Jackson-sponsored change in the rules on apportionment of presidential nominating was undone, with another to follow later. The committee restored the status of its 303 members as uncommitted delegates to future conventions. Later, with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s support, it plans to revive a requirement that candidates in the 1992 primaries and caucuses get at least 15 percent of the vote in order to win committed delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advocates straight proportional representation.

 <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to a refugee camp here in search of a quiet place, away from the rockets, bombs and bullets she thought would shatter her comfortable life back home. Finding such peace has left the 33-year-old woman without word of her husband in the Afghan army and cost her a career and ultimately her identity. Now she is forced to hide her face behind a veil in public _ in accordance with the customs of the Islamic fundamentalism that prevails at the refugee camp. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the shell-shocked Afghan capital 400 miles away, another woman, <LOCATION> Sadiqqa </LOCATION>, vows never to pay that price. `` I would rather die,'' the 19-year-old science student at <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Putting on a veil amounts to being imprisoned or kept in a cage. Nothing could be worse.'' President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been been playing on those fears, frequently reminding <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> women of the fundamentalism of the Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow his government. Much has happened to change the lives of <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> women since civil war broke out 11 years ago, said <PERSON> Esmatee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` When the men went to war, the women started working in factories and offices, as painters and carpenters. In short, they got their first taste of freedom. These are the women who would have a difficult time under the fundamentalists,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, one of two women with Cabinet-rank in <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. The women's rights movement took root in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1919, the year it declared its independence. When <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> was 3 years old in 1959, King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> decreed that women no longer had to wear the chadri, the tent-like pleated garment with a mesh opening over the eyes. Encouraged by her family and particularly her father, <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> said, she wore Western clothes, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and went to work as an accountant in a government office. That changed with the war. When her husband was drafted into the Afghan army nearly four years ago, <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> took their small son and daughter across the mountains to western <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they have lived in a two-room mud hut furnished with ragged pillows on the floor and decorated with pictures from magazines pasted on the walls. She said she does n't know if her husband is dead or alive. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> she and a few others like her were suddenly surrounded and alienated by <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> women with traditional ideas, women with whom they had little contact back home. Envied or ostracized by the others, <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> and those like her complain of the narrowness of their lives and of the hard times imposed by the mullahs, the religious leaders who roam the camp searching for wrongdoing. The slightest infringement is reported to the mullahs. And since she is dependent on them for food and other necessities, her children will suffer for her misdemeanors. <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> said she is obedient because of her 9-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter. Soon the daughter will be forced to wear a veil in public. `` Right now, she's as free as she'll ever be in her life,'' <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> said. `` Soon she will lose that freedom and have to join the other women.'' But there is no way out until the war ends. `` Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever return home,'' she said. `` I wo n't go back if the fundamentalists come to power. I will not stay under this veil and be hounded by the mullahs. I want to be happy again.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus, with Western rock music blaring from a portable stereo, <PERSON> Sadiqqa </PERSON> and her friends discuss the plight of women like <PERSON> Sharifa </PERSON> who are forced to abandon their ambitions and modern lifestyles for what they call `` <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON>'s medieval fortress.'' <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> is a Moslem guerrilla leader. `` If you're married, you're a wife. Otherwise, you are just a woman,'' said <PERSON> Sadiqqa </PERSON>, dressed in tight Western blue jeans, a blue T-shirt with sequin appliques and her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. `` Islam is n't against women working, but <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s interpretations are always done by men. That's the problem.'' Those fears were heightened last year when the guerrilla leaders drafted a constitution stating women must be kept in purdah, the practice of wearing the veiled costume. Although the constitution was later abandoned, many leaders in the seven-party guerrilla alliance still say they would not want women to vote in an election of a new Afghan government. But the war has made <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> women on both sides of the border more assertive and determined. `` I am a Moslem but I will never, ever again wear a chadri,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, one of four women elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 when <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> women were given the right to vote. `` Islamic law does not require it and now there are many women like me who will fight anyone who tried to put us back under the veil. We will defend our rights.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> was wearing a white suit with pink scarf tied around her neck the day she was interviewed in her <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> office. She said Afghan society has become much more dependent on women during the decade-long struggle between the government and the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. The war has left one-third of the country's 15 million people dead, living in exile or in refugee camps along the border. Moslem women in general have a long tradition of fighting for their beliefs and their countries, dating back to the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Aisha </PERSON>, who went to battle beside her husband on a camel. Afghan women have a long history of being on the front lines, including fighting the British during three wars in the 19th century. Today is no exception, said Mrs. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, who earned a master's degree in education at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. More than 8,000 women have enlisted in the armed forces, training as pilots and paratroopers and fighting side-by-side with male soldiers, she `` Men present themselves as intrepid and heroic, telling how they have suffered by going to war,'' she said. `` Women have suffered a lot since the revolution. They have lost husbands and fathers, sons and brothers.'' Women will be essential in rebuilding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> once the conflict ends, Mrs. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> added. `` We are a backward country. How can a society improve without the participation of women, especially at this stage of development in the world? It's impossible.''

<HEAD>Heyerdahl, at 75, Exploring Ruins Predating Incas in Peru</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At age 75, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> is digging in a remote area near the coast of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for treasures left by a civilization be believes is older and more advanced than the celebrated Incas of the Andes. More than 40 years earlier, <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> set sail from the same Peruvian coast for <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> on the Kon-Tiki, the primitive wooden raft that first carried him to fame. <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> is exploring a sprawling complex called the Tucume pyramids, which he believes were built by ancient seafarers who reached the new world on fragile rafts like <PERSON> Kon-Tiki </PERSON> about the time of Christ or before. `` This is the greatest archeological find of the century. ... It's the most exciting project of my life,'' a trim <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said in an interview while in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> recently to celebrate his birthday at his boyhood home in <ORGANIZATION> Larvik </ORGANIZATION>, a southern town of 38,000 people. <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said he was introduced to the Tucume find by the Peruvian archaeologist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>. Work on the 26-pyramid complex began last year, but `` an area of this size is not studied in one man's lifetime,'' <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said. `` It will take generations.'' The find, he said, may cast doubt on current theories about the settlers of ancient <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The pyramids were made of adobe, a material most often used in those times in distant <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION>, the region near what now is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, he said. He added that he is certain he will find a treasure of gold and artifacts when he opens the ancient tombs. The complex in northwest <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is linked to the sea by a 12-mile system of canals big enough for rafts like <PERSON> Kon-Tiki </PERSON> to sail through, he said. The canals once were filled in but later dredged out for irrigation channels. `` One of the first utensils we found was a small steering oar from a small balsa raft,'' <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said. Seashells and stones from distant parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> found there also indicate that the builders of Tucume were an ancient race of sailors, he said. Spanish explorers found the coastal complex in the 1500s, but they continued into the Andes in search of Inca treasure `` and Tucome was forgotten by the world,'' <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said. Oral histories of coastal dwellers recorded by the Spaniards told of fleets of rafts that brought King <PERSON> Nymlap </PERSON> at least 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that his grandson, <PERSON> Kala </PERSON>, started work on the pyramids, <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said. `` I could only prove that balsa rafts were seaworthy and could sail,'' he said of his 101-day, 4,300-mile voyage on the <LOCATION> Kon-Tiki </LOCATION> in 1947. `` Here we have the final proof that they did sail and they did navigate in the open ocean.'' <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> set out on Kon-Tiki in an attempt to prove his theory that prehistoric civilizations reached the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> from across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> on rafts carried by ocean currents. He said he and his researchers had not yet determined when the people who built Tucume arrived in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. But he added that the find predates the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> and even the Chimo, a tribe vanquished by the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> about 1100 A.D. `` By the time we finish excavation we will be able to say when it all started,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> were to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> what the Romans were in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They were not the founders of culture. They were the military power that took over what others had created.'' Though the origins are obscure, <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> said, it is clear the Tucume civilization was wiped out. `` There are many lessons in the past and one lesson is that not one civilization has been eternal,'' he said.

 Consider the advantages of pedal power: inexpensive and pollution-free. There are twice as many bicycles as there are automobiles, yet much of the world is curiously ambivalent toward them. Are they relics of another century or are they the wave of the future?
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JOHN BARBOUR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Here they come, thousands at a time steering quietly down the streets of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, or a file of humped silhouettes etched against the mountain-ocean sunset of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Here they come, bicycles and their riders, caught by the dawn's early light or the headlight's glare, pumping legs, determined faces, wheeling to work, wheeling home, or just determined to stay fit Bicycles. There are 800 million in all, 88 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 300 million in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a very personal, pollution-free mode of transportation. The question is: Are they relics of another century, or are they the wave of the future? The competition is the automobile, 400 million in the world. No one in his right mind would say it's an even fight. But the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a think tank, recently published Worldwatch Paper 90 by <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> with the title `` The Bicycle. Vehicle For A Small Planet.'' The message is that bicycles consume less energy per passenger mile than any other form of transportation, including walking. A cyclist can cover 3 -LCB- miles on the calories in an ear of corn, 10 miles on the 350 calories in a bowl of rice. The average American car covers 10 miles on about half a gallon of gasoline, or 18,600 calories. Bicyclists do not produce smog or acid rain. They do not endanger the ozone layer and few cyclists are pulled over for DWI. They do produce sweat, however. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> writes that 33 states included bicycle promotion measures in their plans to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1970. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would make major employers reduce the ratio of commuting cars to employees. Other Western cities would make employers provide bicycle parking and shower facilities. All of this comes 90 years after the bicycle craze crested in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In 1899, with automobiles not yet on the road, and public transportation in the form of trolleys and electric trains just an infant enterprise, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was selling more than a million bicycles a year. In a nation of barely 76 million, those were impressive figures. So ubiquitous were those `` safety'' bikes that they altered American fashions. Knickers kept pants legs out of the way of chain drives, long <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> jackets caught the mud, and women began to wear shorter skirts and, heaven forfend, bloomers, so they could ride their bikes. Whole families would go out for weekend bicycle outings. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahradnik </PERSON> of Bicycling magazine points out that the bicycle was a vehicle for technology as well as people. The <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> were bicycle makers, as were hundreds of other tinkerers of the late 1800s. <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> experimented with lightweight tubing that eventually made their airplane design possible. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> worked on bicycles and applied motors to them before he concentrated on aircraft engine design. If one looks into the past, he may find some hints to the bicycle's future. In its heyday, the bike was personalized, individual transportation. `` It did n't have the upkeep of a horse or the expense of a carriage,'' <PERSON> Zahradnik </PERSON> says. `` If the roads got bad, you could pick it up and carry it. It was one of the fastest, easiest, simplest forms of transportation.'' And it built roads. It was the complaints of bicyclists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and state capitals that led to the first modern surge of road-building. It paved the way for the automobile. But, oddly, it was n't the car that led to the fall of the bicycle. It was public transportation, steam-powered locomotives and the electric trolley, which were felled in turn by the car. In the late 1800s, a good bike cost about $ 100, which was expensive in days when the average income was $ 8 a week. Today some are as cheap as $ 100 or as expensive as $ 3,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes about 5 million bikes a year and imports another 5 million. Americans, however, remain in love with their cars. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where one person in every 74,000 owns an automobile, one in four owns a bike. In one study in the northern industrial city of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, monitors counted 50,000 bicycles passing one intersection in an hour. Bicycle ownership does not mean bicycle use. Forty-one million American bikes are owned by children. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, one out of every four people owns a bike, yet only one out of every 33 transport trips are made by bike. Writes <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has seven times as many bicycles per person as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but because one out of every two Americans owns an automobile _ compared with one out of 500 Indians _ bicycles play a much more modest role in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transportation system.'' The Chinese phenomenon began when the last emperor, <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, began pedaling around the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the early 1900s. Today, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s annual bike sales exceed 40 million. `` The rest of the developing world lags far behind in bicycle transportation,'' says the Worldwatch report. `` In much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and even more widely in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the prestige and power of auto ownership has made governments ignore pedal power and led citizens to scorn the bicycle as a vehicle for the poor.'' Oddly, the cost of fuel for Latin American and African cars contributes to their national debt and their trade deficits. There are exceptions. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the city's largest bakery replaced most of its trucks with 900 delivery trikes to supply 60,000 neighborhood shops

 In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> have taken steps to make their roads more friendly for cyclists with the result that bicycles are used for 20 percent to 30 percent of all urban trips and up to half in some towns. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a recent system of taxes increased the cost of buying and driving a car by half. An electronic system will monitor speedometers and excessive drivers will be taxed accordingly. At the same time, public transit is being given an extra $ 5.7 billion a year. In <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, officials claim that gasoline prices are the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, thanks to aggressive taxing. And, says the <LOCATION> Worldwatch </LOCATION> report, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> describes the 186 percent sales tax on new cars _ compared with 47 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 5 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ as paying for three cars and getting only one. A British study said that if only 10 percent of car trips of less than 10 miles were made by bicycle it would cut the country's fuel consumption by 14 million barrels of oil a year, 2 percent of annual consumption The ironies abound. Third World governments concentrate on building roads for cars in their rural areas despite the fact that their rural citizens do not have cars or trucks. Worldwatch quotes transportation expert <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> as saying, `` Many miles of roads in poor countries prove more useful for drying beans and peppers than for moving traffic.'' And even though bicycle rickshaws are a transportation mainstay in many <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, and a means of raising the income and status of poor people, some local governments say they are unsafe or inhumane. A more likely motive, says <PERSON> Worldwatch </PERSON>, is that the quaint rickshaws make cities look poor or backward. So it comes to pass that in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the government threatened to phase out rickshaws, even though they employ 140,000 people and account for more than half of the city's passenger miles. And in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, some 100,000 rickshaws have been confiscated in the last five years and dumped into the sea. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which makes cars for most of the world, leans heavily on bicycles and commuter railroads. When railway terminals began to suffer from bicycle pollution, the government set aside bike parking lots of which there are now 8,600 with a capacity of 2.4 million bikes. In urban downtowns where land prices are over $ 7,000 a square foot, they have built bike parking towers. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the university towns of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> vie for cycling honors. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> boasts that a quarter of all trips made by its 44,000 citizens are made by bike. Bike trailers are a common sight for lugging groceries or children. Palo Alto pays its employees 7 cents a mile for all business travel by bike. It sponsors a city wide `` leave your car at home day,'' has a bicycle squad in its police force and holds a traffic school for children who break bicycle laws. Some employers in the city of 56,000 have joined the movement. One offers bike commuters $ 1 a day for every day they ride to work. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> provides free towel service in the shower room. It's been 173 years since the first bike appeared in 1816. A lot has changed. Bikes have evolved from a crude contraption called the hobbyhorse, which was propelled by the rider's feet on the ground, to the enlarged front wheel that covered more ground for each revolution of the rider's pedals, to chain drives and the safety bicycle, to today's one-piece lightweight frames. Bicycles gave the world ball bearings and pneumatic tires. In the late 1800s, bicycle racers were some of the highest paid athletes in the country, garnering winnings of between $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 a year. `` They were like today's superstars,'' says Bicycling's <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahradnik </PERSON>. `` They traveled the world to race.'' Thousands flocked to see the six-day bike races on wooden or concrete tracks. At the turn of the century there were some 200 race tracks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. One racer was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -LRB- Mile-a-Minute -RRB- <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. On June 30, 1899, he pumped up to 60 mph on a board track making use of the suction behind a fast locomotive. Another, <PERSON> Zahradnik </PERSON> says, was <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, `` one of the first great black athletes to emerge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the late 1800s. He was often turned down by hotels on his world racing circuit.'' Bike makers have constantly changed designs to appeal to young riders. With the balloon tire came Schwinn's Streamliner. There was the <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> bike by <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, sporting a <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> hood ornament and a quack-quack horn. There was the <ORGANIZATION> Huffy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiobike </ORGANIZATION>, which had a radio in the tank on the crossbars. In the late 1950s there was <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacelander </PERSON> and a drag racer called the Schwinn Orangecrate. But now engineers are setting out to improve designs for practical reasons. Bicycle trailers and three - and four-wheel designs are increasing the load-carrying capacity The Oxtrike, designed at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, has a platform and gears capable of moving heavy cargo. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, designers are working on a multipurpose bike that can double as a non-transportation motor for threshing rice paddies, shelling peanuts or pumping water. It may indeed be that the wheels of the past will power the future.

 Come along on a ride on a bicycle built for two, through a scenic area of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that has changed little over the centuries. It's really the best way to see the countryside and meet the people, but couch potatoes had best spend a while getting in shape before setting out on a pedal-power tour.

 Imagine days of gliding through scenes from Roman antiquity on a bicycle, with midmorning stops for cappuccino, streamside lunches of fresh-baked bread, cheese, prosciutto and wine and evenings in luxurious villas. Thousands of people, young and old, athlete and couch potato, are finding travel by bicycle an exhilarating way of really seeing the countryside, talking to people and finding historic or cultural locales rarely available to those speeding through on air-conditioned tour buses. Many adventurous souls are setting off on bicycle trips on their own, loading their two-wheelers with clothing, bedrolls and necessities. Others are letting a tour company make lodging arrangements, plan an itinerary, schedule meals and provide a van to haul luggage. Bicycle tours are available through most European countries, most areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. I and my wife chose one of the most experienced biking and walking tour operators, <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and rode from near <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> on a bicycle built for two, a French-made 10-speed tandem. You can ship your own bike or the tour operator will provide custom-made bicycles. The American Bicycle Federation says the number of bicyclers in this country increased from 78 million to 88 million since 1985. It is expected the bicycle craze will spurt again now that American <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMond </PERSON> has won the prestigious Tour de France. Several states hold popular cross-state bicycle tours. One of the most grueling is the Ride the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> tour that this year covered 361 miles and went over 11,990-foot <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. Tour director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> said 3,500 people applied for the tour, which is limited to 2,000. Our Northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> group included 23 Americans _ people from all walks of life from all parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ages ranged from about 30 to the 60s. Tour operators said the eldest to date had been a 78-year-old man. Some had done nothing more to train for the trip than their usual tennis or golf game. They also were a little stiff and sore the first day or two, but that quickly went away. My wife and I had bicycled about 30 miles on Saturdays and Sundays for two months before the tour and found the tour a breeze. Bicycle helmets and biking gloves are strongly recommended and an athletic shoe with a firm sole is a good idea. Otherwise, clothing is left up to the individual. On the tour, attire ranged from skin-tight bicycling outfits to shorts, T-shirts and slacks. A lightweight rain jacket is recommended, for chilly mornings and afternoon showers. Our group gathered in the lobby of a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> hotel and then it was off by bus to <LOCATION> Sirmione </LOCATION>, on a peninsula on the southern shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest. At the tip, a modern hydrofoil passenger boat cruised past the ruins of a Roman spa. Idling past sidewalk cafes, coffee shops and tourists, the bus squeezed through a narrow passageway at a historic castle, then deposited our group at the steps of <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cortine </ORGANIZATION>, the first of several luxurious villas where our palates would be pampered at multicourse meals and our bodies rested in regal suites. Our two guides _ <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> lawyer, and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>, whose future plans include screenwriting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ showed us our bicycles and gave us an orientation on safety, including the required wearing of helmets and a caution against braking hard with only the front brake -LRB- it can throw you over the handlebars -RRB-. They discussed the daily routine: breakfast together and then to the bicycles, which would be checked and ready. The cyclists were encouraged to set their own pace and see the sights. Some raced off each morning on optional side trips that saw them travel up to 50 miles in a day. Others stopped to take photographs, visit with the natives, enjoy a cappuccino or espresso and purchase postcards, still completing the average 30 miles a day in time for a swim at the villa.

 Detailed instructions for each day's route were handed out at breakfast with a caveat that directions are subject to personal interpretation and `` one person's ` bear right at the cross' could be another's ` hard right at the T-intersection.''' And, said the guides, `` remember _ getting lost is part of the adventure.'' A sample instruction read `` 2 km -LRB- kilometers -RRB- from the tower, turn right at intersection following signs for Vaccarolo and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pietro </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Solferino </LOCATION>. -LRB- At this intersection the abandoned Abbey of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Firgillo </LOCATION> can be seen directly in front of you. -RRB-'' Tours are graded by level of difficulty from the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> level one -LRB- rolling hills and generally level, but with one hill where we pushed the tandem to the top -RRB- to the level four <PERSON> Giro </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Italia </PERSON>, described as `` a challenging route through the hills of <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Umbria </LOCATION> ... designed for the enthusiastic and experienced cyclist.'' An example of the magnificent villas chosen for touring bicyclers was the Villa Corner in <LOCATION> Cavasagra </LOCATION>, built in 1500 and named for a queen, <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornaro </PERSON>. The villa was extensively rebuilt in 1700 by a Palladian architect. Today it has manicured grounds, a vineyard, huge pool, spa, tennis courts and suites the size of some American town houses. After we finished the tour and went sightseeing in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, the room at our pensione was the size of the walk-in closet in our Villa Corner suite. The tour stayed on side roads with light traffic. Even when the cyclists pedaled into larger cities such as <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>, they found Italian motorists to be considerate. Thousands of Italians pedal to school, to work or to the market, but safety helmets are unknown and ours brought many curious glances. Sights along the way included ancient and modern churches, centuries-old family estates, more castles than could be counted, family-operated wineries and a wedding celebration. In <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> there was a wine lecture and tasting at the <ORGANIZATION> Instituto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enologico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiano </ORGANIZATION>, a tour of the ancient Roman arena and the opera house, a visit to the balcony of <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> fame and a walk through the crowded stalls in the marketplace where we ate bambolino _ calorie-laden fried dough sprinkled with sugar. One day's highlights included a tour of <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, one of the countless small wineries. This one, operated by <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraccaroli </PERSON>, produced a delicate white wine, samples of which were offered to the American cyclists. A tractor arrived, pulling a trailer with the first day's pickings of the new grape harvest. The tourists watched as the grapes were crushed. On day five, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> surprised the group with a picnic feast in the courtyard of an ancient castle on a hilltop outside the walled city of <LOCATION> Soave </LOCATION>. They loaded a table with fruits, cheeses, meats, breads and wines, highlighted by bunches of fresh-picked wildflowers. A group photograph was taken for posterity. After a day's ride, there was a cocktail party where the day's events were discussed Then, a sumptuous dinner. One evening menu read: crepes, pasta and smoked ham, pasta e fagioli alla veneta -LRB- traditional pasta and beans in a cream soup -RRB-, roast beef al <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> or sole a la Venetian, then choices from a breathtaking dessert tray, followed by hearty Italian coffee, all accompanied by fine Italian wines. Since it was harvest time, bowls of incredibly sweet grapes were placed in reception areas and guest rooms. All too soon, the bicyclists reached <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cavasagra </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, the final destination. `` This was my first tour, but I expect we'll do it again,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakemore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenbrae </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said: `` I loved talking to all the people It was really neat to ride down the road and say ` buon giorno' to the villagers.'' `` It was one unforgettable incident after another,'' said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Capozzi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tiburon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 When she's not at work, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> likes wearing bikinis, off-the-shoulder dresses and slinky long gowns.

 Charging through the boondocks with a 50-pound pack on her back, rappelling from a 45-foot tower, or crawling under barbed wire to the chatter of machine guns may seem a long way from <PERSON> Bergdorf </PERSON>'s, but Marine drill instructor <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> does n't think her chosen career is bizarre. `` Shoot, when women first voted that was considered bizarre,'' she says in a demure <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> accent reminiscent, like her upswept strawberry blond hairdo, of a young <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. `` Mine just happens to be a career a lot of women do n't pick. Or males either, for that matter.'' Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> turned up her voice level and barked an order at a recruit daydreaming in the shade of a scrawny tree to the blam-blam lullaby of the adjacent hand grenade course. `` Grab your war bonnet, <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, and double-time back to your squad.'' `` Aye, aye, Ma'am,'' cried the boot, gathering up her M-16 rifle and disappearing into the woods while trying to jam the new Kevlar helmet onto a matted mop of pinned-up curls. Platoon 4028 was in its ninth week of boot camp at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, three weeks shy of graduation. They were found bivouacked in pup tents at the edge of an abandoned airstrip, fighting a guerrilla war against mosquitoes, sand fleas, an occasional rattle snake and raccoons as big as dogs. `` Those raccoons thrive on our MRE's _ meals ready to eat,'' the D.I. explains. Reveille had sounded at 4:45 a.m.. A murky blob of a sun, promising another blistering, humid day, barely pinked the surrounding marshes when <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> double-timed her 47 charges out to the infiltration course Two dead rats floating in the ditch before a wall that had to be scaled added an unscheduled horror to the grueling exercise. `` Crawl, use both legs, keep your heels and head down. Low silhouette on that wall,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> told her recruits between <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> blasts anointing them with mud. In the control tower, synchronizing the detonations so a charge went off whenever a recruit crept near a sandbag bunker, Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> spotted one boot more terrified of the dead rodents than the live explosives. She bounded out of the ditch and over the wall like an Olympic hurdler. `` You're dead,'' he rasped over the loudspeaker in a deep <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> drawl. `` You did n't check for booby traps. Now somebody's got to go to your Mommy and <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>'s home and tell them you're dead because you did n't listen. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> a decade ago mustered out demeaning obscenities and an occasional busted lip as too negative an approach to molding character, drill instructors have resorted to a lingua franca rich in morbid humor and inelegant variations just a tad shy of the scatological. `` Camouflaged cussing,'' as one of them called it, has made trash an all-purpose word, as when a D.I. bellows, `` Do n't give me any of that trash'' or `` Pick up your trash and move out'' or `` Plunge those gun barrels 15 times. Get all that trash out of there.'' All prospective women <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> go through boot camp at the <ORGANIZATION> Parris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> under female instructors who work side-by-side with male instructors. Their training is as rugged as males undergo, except that women spend an extra week honing combat skills because they will not be going on to advanced infantry training. `` They claim we women will not be going to war, and will only be used in support, but I do n't know anyone who believes that,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said as her sweat-soaked, mud-caked recruits hurried off to the last of the three hot showers allotted during their 10 days in the field. `` We teach'em to be aggressive and to know how to defend themselves. If it ever comes down to it, they're going to fight.'' Recruits rarely wear makeup in the field, except facial paint for combat maneuvers. But Marines of both sexes slosh on a particular brand of bath oil in the belief that it fends off the low country's voracious insects. `` They do n't completely surrender their femininity,'' observed <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, looking feminine in her utility field cap, polished combat boots and a wide shiny black belt _ the sign of a senior D.I. _ hugging a Meryl Streep figure in crisply starched `` cammies,'' camouflaged fatigues. Female boots can make appointments at the beauty parlor, while men get those flattops on a barbershop assembly line. `` They can wear their hair any way they want, as long as it does n't fall below the shoulder,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says. Female instructors never fancied the `` Smokey,'' the broad-brimmed felt hat that their male counterparts tilt over their eyes. Instead, the distinguishing mark of their profession is a braided scarlet cord or `` pogey rope'' draped over the left shoulder. On parade, both sexes expertly brandish a ceremonial sword. How did an admittedly `` shy, quiet kind of kid'' from a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> high school in northeast <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> wind up swinging on a rope like <PERSON> Tarzan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> across a murky pond and bellowing `` Roll over like a dead roach with your feet in the air'' at recruits who fail to don a gas mask in nine seconds? `` The nuns back at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hubert </LOCATION>'s would never believe it,'' says <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who turns 24 this month. `` I did n't feel like going on to college, but I did n't want to do anything ordinary. So I joined up.'' Good at sports, she breezed through boot camp, became a coach on the rifle range, went to radio school, then spent 9 -LCB- weeks at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s co-ed drill instructors school. `` The most strenuous course in the corps,'' proclaims 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the top <ORGANIZATION> NCO </ORGANIZATION> at the D.I. school. `` But lady leathernecks do n't get any breaks around here. When I look down that line, I do n't see males or females. I just see Marines.''

 In the courtyard beyond his window, Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the first female instructor at the D.I. school, was drilling men and women D.I. candidates in the bombastic basics of issuing commands. `` Their voices may sound different, but they got to be loud,'' mused the first sergeant. `` These women come to hate me as much as the men, but after they leave here they have a change of heart. Some even invite me to their weddings.'' Recruits may doubt it, but a drill instructor's heart is capable of a meltdown leading to matrimony. Sometimes they marry other drill instructors. `` And that's total war,'' laughs D.I. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>'s cohorts who has undergone an interesting change in nomenclature. Before her divorce, she was Sgt. Nails and gloried in the mock initials <PERSON> H.A. </PERSON>, for `` Hard As Nails.'' Her modest boast is `` never having met a recruit I could n't handle, but I know my day is coming.'' In her knife defense class, Sgt. Love sent a recruit sprawling and nimbly missed staightening her Orphan Annie curls with a combat boot to the cadence cry of `` grab, smash, hook, twist and stomp.'' `` Nothing I like better than seeing Marines slamming hard on the deck,'' says the close combat instructor, identified by the skull and crossed bayonets on his T-shirt. `` The female of the Marine species is way deadlier than the male.'' The scene was a far cry from a decade ago when women recruits were taught how to pour tea and were required to wear girdles. As <ORGANIZATION> D.I. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> receives a $ 260 increment to her staff sergeant's basic pay of $ 1,325 a month Her working hours from reveille at 4:45 a.m. to Taps at 8:45 p.m. leave `` little time for romance,'' she says, while donning a MOPP -LRB- mission orientation protective posture -RRB- suit to lead her platoon into `` the house of pain,'' the gas chamber. `` When we're not working we're sleeping.'' Ashore, as Marines call being away from the depot in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lingo, the D.I. enjoys being a young woman. `` I still wear my hair long. People do n't even know I'm a Marine. I love wearing bikinis, off-the-shoulder dresses and slinky long gowns. `` I like men picking up the dinner check _ that's survival _ and opening the door for you. Hey, I'm no brute.'' D.I. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> has never been in a situation where she had to employ her martial arts skill. `` But stuff has sure happened to a lot of my recruits. They've been raped or mugged or something, and they wish they'd known then how to defend themselves.'' Almost every new batch of recruits arriving at Fourth Battalion, the women's recruit unit, includes at least one undetected pregnancy, several college graduates, a number of kids fleeing inner-city violence or small-town boredom, a couple of `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'' over-achievers, and always the platoon comic. `` Comedians help relieve tension, as long as their jokes are n't aimed at us,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says `` We tell recruits when to laugh and when not to.'' All recruits have to test drug-free, and 99 percent are high school graduates. Although boot-type `` shock incarceration'' programs are being tested at prisons in a dozen states, few come to <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> straight from the criminal court docket. `` The old days of four in the corps or 10 in the pen are gone,'' says Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` Hey, we're choosy now.'' Drill instructors off duty swap stories about the `` yo-yos'' who march to a different cadence count under the platoon guide-on. `` We get the female <PERSON> Gomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyles </PERSON> and the Pvt. Benjamins,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says. `` They do some funny things. `` The Pvt. <ORGANIZATION> Benjamins </ORGANIZATION> are the best _ the pretty ones with the long fingernails. We call them powderpuffs. They've been babied all their lives. We make them earn their keep.'' <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> graduates 19,000 new Marines a year, 1,800 of them women. Both sexes have the same drop-out rate, about 15 percent. `` Mental stress washes out more of them than the physical demands,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says. `` You can always build someone up, but some ca n't cope with having to do a couple of things at the same time in a hurry.'' Her outstanding recruit this time around is Pvt. <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Racquet </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Blossvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who stands 4-foot-9, wears a size 2 -LCB- shoe, totes a pack half her weight and outscored all the males on the rifle range. `` I call her my mini-recruit,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says. `` Her feet always hurt. They ca n't find boots to fit her, but she's proof that women can do it all.'' <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is just beginning to rebound from its `` Lesbian Mafia'' headlines of a year ago when three women <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> were jailed and 14 others were administratively discharged for homosexual liaisons that included drill instructors and recruits. Now it is facing another social problem of our times: single parents. `` We get single parents, both men and women, signing up for D.I. school,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> says. `` I got a gut feeling there's just no way a D.I. can make a good single parent.'' Down the road, a decade or so from now, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> sees herself in a more sedate career: `` I'd like to be a housewife, with a couple of kids, but I'd have to do something else. I'm not much at sitting around the back yard.'' Does she worry that her D.I. past might make her more of martinet than a mother, bullying, even brutalizing her kids like the Marine parent in the movie `` The Great Santini''? `` Who me?'' she asks, those big gray eyes widening in shock. `` No way. Shoot, the way I treat my recruits, why I'm so nice to them, they abuse me more than I abuse them.''

 Three toxic waste sites in a town of 30,000 may not be a record, but it certainly has got the attention of the townspeople of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, regardless of which side they are on.

 <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> remembers hunting swamp rabbits as a boy down by the town dump, how the frisky rabbits would jump when you sneaked up and run for half a mile. They made good eating. He also remembers swimming in nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dupree </LOCATION>, always curious about the wind-whipped orange foam that lathered its banks. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is now 39. He is so ill he ca n't work, has lost all feeling in one arm, and his brother and sister also have strange allergies and ailments the doctors ca n't seem to correct. Today the dump has a chain-link fence around it with a red sign that says `` KEEP OUT. HAZARDOUS WASTE AREA.'' As for the rabbits, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> remembers when their always reliable numbers began to dwindle and you had to walk up and kick one to get it to move. `` I killed one, took it home, cut it open and it was yellow as a lemon inside,'' he recalls. `` It stank.'' <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, a town of 30,000 just north of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, is the location of three toxic waste sites on the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s `` priority'' list _ Super Fund sites. Thousands of drums containing waste byproducts of now-banned herbicides sit on a covered concrete slab where four chemical companies operated for 40 years. For more than 10 years, since the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> first started investigating, some of the towns citizens have been raising a stink of their own. They fear they are being poisoned by dioxin. Among 1,194 priority cleanup sites across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -LRB- out of more than 30,000 non-priority sites -RRB- three may not seem like many, but these citizens feel that in a town this size it is quite a distinction, though dubious, and 10 years is a long time to wait to get it cleaned up. `` This town is a chemical soup,'' says <PERSON> Claudett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, `` and I'm angry about it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> is <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s sister, which would explain her anger, not to mention her own constant headaches and back problems. She is also vice president of a group called <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> a Chemically Contaminated Environment. On the other hand, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> boosters say that the town has confronted its problem and is supporting a cleanup, and that notoriety hurts the town's image. `` We are left with a legacy that requires remediation,'' says state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Fortunately that contamination is confined to a very small area that affects no one that we can see. There's a lot of sex appeal for the media in dead-baby stories.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is spokesman for a group called <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION>. A third group, <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleanup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, was awarded three <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> grants of $ 50,000 to hire technical advisers to monitor cleanup at all three sites: <ORGANIZATION> Reasor-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and successors <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vertac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That's when the dispute boiled over Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>'s group, furious, told the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Hercules </PERSON> was a member of the opposition group, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION>. The government, she maintained, would be paying a transgressor to monitor the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> withdrew the grants. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> acknowledges <PERSON> Hercules </PERSON> was a member of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleanup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> has many of the same members, but he says <PERSON> Hercules </PERSON> was not one of them. `` Since we had told <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from the very beginning that <PERSON> Hercules </PERSON> was a contributor to <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> and they knew it, I ca n't understand why they changed their mind,'' says <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Now that they have changed their mind we are going to find out why.''

 With the grants up for grabs, enter a fourth group: the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>'s group and others who are angry That group has applied for the grants and has vowed to oppose any attempt by the coalition group to try again for the money by `` sanitizing'' its membership. At least, says Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal of the grants should inspire people nationwide to fight regulatory decisions. The president of the coalition, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, says the group did indeed intend to use the technical advisers to play down publicity about the contamination, but <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says that is not so. `` We have got a proven record,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says. `` The big picture in all this is not whether we or someone else receives a grant. The purpose of the grant is to educate and inform, and we are doing that anyway. The big picture is solving the problem, and that is cleaning up this chemical contamination.'' Meanwhile, those barrels of toxic waste remain. MRK, an incineration frim in <LOCATION> Zachary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, received a contract in July to do a trial burn next March at the 93-acre Vertac site. If tests go well, it could start incinerating 2.5 million tons an hour a month later, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION>. Vertac, which began as a World War II ordnance plant, produced the herbicide known as Agent Orange. To incinerate about 28,000 barrels of the ingredients of that herbicide would take about six months, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> estimates. If the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> judges the ash to be non-hazardous, it will be put in drums and buried in a landfill. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says there is no medical evidence to link the chemicals and the illnesses, which Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> concedes _ for now. Even if the chemicals are burned and buried, she says, it wo n't slow her crusade She says her group plans to make a door-to-door health survey to document community illnesses. She has her own, and her brother, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, has his, and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> says he had a friend who worked at <LOCATION> Vertac </LOCATION> and died of cancer. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> says his friend told him the company sent home a letter telling his family to wash his clothes separately. But <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a slight, bearded man with a useless arm, hands that tremble, asthma, allergies and chronic headaches, says no one ever warned him about swimming in the lake with the orange foam or of eating the rabbits and the fish he brought home for the family table. `` They were doing this to people and they knew about it and they did n't tell the people about it,'' he says. But when he opened up a rabbit and it stank, did n't he suspect? `` It did n't dawn on people what was what,'' he says. After all, those companies provided good jobs for good pay. The only other big employer in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> is an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base. Only retribution against the polluters, it seems, will satisfy Ms. <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON>'s life is ruined,'' she says. `` His future is gone. And a multibillion-dollar industry is reaping the profits at the expense of somebody like this. `` I think it's time our government officials stood up and took a stand and said, ` That's enough.'''

 To satisfy the growing demand for lumber at the end of World War II, loggers began cutting down all the trees in large sections of forest and replanting the area with trees of a commercially desirable species. That practice, called clear-cutting, has persisted to this day, even in publicly owned national forests. There is one notable exception, the <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 New restrictions on the way loggers harvest timber in the vast <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has given environmentalists hope that others will follow suit. A <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> management plan that went into effect last year bans almost all clear-cutting, the chopping down of all trees regardless of their age in tracts of 20 to 40 acres, instead of selective cutting of individual trees. `` What happened in the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> is nationally significant because it's never happened before,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now you can say: ` Look at the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>. If they can do it, why ca n't we?''' But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which manages 156 national forests, is not rushing into a nationwide ban on clear-cutting. `` Our management philosophy,'' explains <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief, `` is to let these things be worked out locally as it has been done in the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>. We want to be at peace with the local people.'' Some heated words were exchanged in the battle of the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>, a 262,000-acre forest of oak and hickory bounded on the east by the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and on the west by the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glisson </PERSON> of the grassroots organization <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmentalists </ORGANIZATION> called his opposition `` bumbling idiots.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Glisson </PERSON>'s group `` meddlesome folks'' and troublemakers. Somewhere in the middle was the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentalists say clear-cutting causes erosion, degrades water quality, reduces the wildlife habitat and leaves an ugly landscape of stumps and ruffled underbrush. But the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, while conceding clear-cutting adversely affects some wildlife, maintains it's the best method of caring for and cultivating forests. Clearcuts, the agency argues, emulate natural disasters such as fires, which rejuvenate timber stands. The large cuts allow sunshine to saturate the forest, enhancing growth. The practice also benefits some game animals such as deer and wild turkey, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. The agency reminds critics that federal law requires it to maintain timber for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s use and that without logging roads the public would have no access to the forest. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, an agency spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, likens clear-cutting to harvesting corn. `` What about clear-cutting in the cornfields? Is n't that what we do? Grow the corn and cut it down?'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> points out that the timber industry nationally employs 1.3 million people with an annual payroll of $ 29.6 billion. `` We're not the bad guys,'' <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> says. `` We're who make the jobs.'' Chopping individual trees was the predominant method of logging before World War II. After the war, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> approved stepped-up clear-cutting to satisfy the growing demand for lumber. The goal of clear-cutting is twofold: the immediate sale of a large quantity of timber and the replacement of the natural forest with even-aged stands of trees of the commercially preferred species. Of the 11 billion to 12 billion board feet cut annually from the 191 million acres of federal forest land, about half is harvested by clear-cutting, says the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> puts the figure closer to 75 percent. The <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> dispute is rooted in the National Forest Management Act of 1976, which required national forests to devise 50-year management plans. The act also required that clear-cutting only be used when found to be the `` optimum method'' of tree harvesting. In November 1986, the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> approved its forest plan. Four appeals were filed by environmental groups. The original draft of the plan emphasized clear-cutting as the preferred method of harvest and placed annual hardwood harvest levels at 12.6 million board feet. A typical 30-foot tree yields about 1,000 board feet. On Aug. 15, 1988, after mediated talks, the agency agreed to alter its forest plan, eliminating clear-cutting almost entirely. All but one appellant, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmentalists </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to drop their appeals. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials and environmentalists say that while management plans in other national forests limit clear-cutting, none comes close to the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>. According to environmentalists, many of the ecological problems linked to clear-cutting are reduced by using individual tree selection or group selection _ smaller cuts in the forest. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Minckler </PERSON>, a consultant on environmental forestry in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and a 33-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, conducted a 20-year experiment in group selection on the <LOCATION> Kaskaskia </LOCATION> Experimental Forest in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He believes it works. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has in almost no cases shown that clear-cutting is the optimum method,'' <PERSON> Minckler </PERSON> says. `` It might be the optimum method for the logger. It's not optimum for the forest.'' <PERSON> Minckler </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> balks at group selection because it's time-consuming and costs more money. Foresters must examine each tree to determine if it's ready for the mill. The agency contends alternatives are unproven, albeit <PERSON> Minckler </PERSON>'s research found that under group selection the forest remains highly diversified, providing a wide range of habitat for wildlife But the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said more acreage is affected by group selection and its smaller cuts in order to get the same harvest volume as clear-cutting. The Regional Association of Concerned Environmentalists, unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, opposes all clear-cutting, except for the elimination of diseased timber stands _ a position that riles the timber industry. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> called the Shawnee clear-cutting ban `` a small step.'' `` We want to see it done more,'' he said, `` but we have no expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will do so willingly.''

 With all the talk of drugs and hard living, of sex and sudden stardom, it's hard to imagine innocence in the record business. But here it is, a handsome, clean-living young man who has made music his life.

 Singer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> is tall, dark, blue-eyed and handsome with a pearly smile. At 23, he is a budding star and photogenic. Trouble is, he's not all that fond of picture-taking sessions and he's trying to get used to offstage celebrity. `` Being on stage is the coolest thing,'' he says. `` That's when I feel comfortable.'' As many journalists seem to want to photograph <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> in fashion layouts as want to talk about his music. His reaction: `` I hate picture taking. I ca n't stand it.'' Then, quickly following his self-instruction to be cooperative, he adds: `` Not that I do n't like them doing it I feel weird.'' His first single, `` Do n't Shut Me Out,'' from his first album, `` <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>,'' is climbing Billboard's best-selling chart, getting played on radio and shown on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> is ready with a second single release, `` Anything I Want.'' `` It's an upbeat, dance-type thing like the first one, but it's more of a statement song,'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> says `` It's about my drive to do something in music and nobody is going to tell me what approach I'm going to take. His first show after the album came out was an outdoor date in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, where `` Do n't Shut Me Out'' was being played on the local radio station. When he came offstage, he says, `` All these teen-agers started trying to get autographs. That was the first experience of that sort I'd ever had. They were mobbing around me, pushing things in my face, saying, ` Sign this.' It was funny. I was laughing the whole time. They probably wonder what I was laughing about. `` They were 8 to 17 or 18, and some ladies, actually.'' `` I do n't date much,'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> says. `` I did in high school, but I was always practicing. I was definitely committed to trying to be a musician, not a husband. Now I'm not home to date, which is kind of bad.'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, who neither smokes nor drinks, has lived his music. He grew up in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, listening to rhythm' n' blues on the radio. `` I guess I was about 10 when I started beating on a snare drum,'' he says. `` That's when I knew I was going to be a musician.'' He did n't think then about being a singer. When he was 13, his mother would drive the youngest of her nine children to clubs in a black area of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> where he'd play drums in a black band. She'd wait for him and drive him home. `` I was trying the other day to analyze what I really like about rhythm' n' blues,'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> says. `` It's the soul and emotion that's put into it But that's what any kind of music is when you think about it.'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>'s father, who has a doctorate and taught voice at a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> college, would have liked him to go to college, if only to have something solid to fall back on. But, <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> says, `` My idea was, how could I make it good if I was n't really committed to doing it. The day after I graduated from high school I immediately hit the road. That's how I made my money, touring the college fraternity circuit all around the South in a band, non-stop, for a couple of years.'' After he quit the band, <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> made a tape of songs he'd written and performed and sent it to record companies. `` Nobody got back to me. I thought: ` That's not going to work. I'd better go up there myself.' I've got friends in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> who are recording people. They said it was pretty hopeless to do that.'' But he wrote some better songs, performed them better and in 1987 arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ with two sisters who came on vacation. He brought a new tape that he took to 20 record companies. `` I came knowing nobody. I knew it was going to be pretty scary. I knew they probably were n't going to listen to it.'' Most did n't. But two did, and one had a good reaction. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> phoned him a month later. `` They obviously saw something, some talent they could develop.'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> wrote nine of his album's 10 songs, all but one after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> signed him. Making the record, he played almost all the instruments on it, overdubbing. `` I played all the synthesizers and piano, bass guitar, rhythm guitar, all the drums that are on there. Most of the drums are machines. I programmed them. I like doing that. `` Making the record was a blast. Trying to promote your record is hard. Once the record is out, it's like school is back in session. The record company has got you going somewhere different every day.'' Asked what he thinks is his strongest quality, he says being nice. `` People like working with you when you're not an arrogant rock' n' roller,'' he says. `` The guy who signed me was patient with me when I was developing songs. If I had had an attitude problem or an ego, who has time for that?'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> and his band will tour. `` I did n't just hire people,'' he says. `` The band is all my friends and they're really great musicians, too. It's a cool situation to be in. `` If the single gets enough success, we'll pick up somebody's tour and open for them If we do n't pick up one, we'll go out on our own in small clubs.''

He also recalls sitting in <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s dressing room and gazing at the star's pet goldfish. `` She was very nice to me, and I was only 9 or 10 years old at the time,'' says <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> of the woman who became a Broadway legend after she sang `` Ca n't Help Lovin' Dat Man'' and `` Bill'' in the musical. `` But what impressed me the most about the show was Cap' n <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>'s play within the play It was a little vaudeville piece and a lot of fun. And of course, I remember ` Ol' Man River.' In those days, they had 16 male singers. That was a lot of sound.'' Nearly 20 years after the musical's premiere, <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> stood in the same place backstage at the Ziegfeld and watched the show again, this time as stage manager of the 1946 revival. Today, he's still watching over the show, having directed it in various revivals all over the country since then. Most recently, he served as production consultant for an opulent three-hour revival of the musical taped last summer at the Paper Mill Playhouse in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for public television's Great Performances and scheduled for viewing Friday in most cities. <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> is the oldest son of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the man who wrote the book and lyrics _ <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> did the music _ for what many people consider the greatest American musical. `` I think I'm the only living person who remembers most of the productions of ` Show Boat' and was closely connected with them,'' says the 70-year-old <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON>. During his career, he has produced television specials, worked for various Broadway producers such as <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, and directors such as <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanin </PERSON>, and supervised many other Hammerstein properties. The new television production of `` Show Boat'' stars <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON> as Cap' n <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Magnolia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ravenal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> as the doomed <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVerne </PERSON>, the role originated by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. It's a cast drawn from a wide range of backgrounds, including opera, Broadway and television. `` They're all wonderful,'' <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> is the best Ravenal I've ever seen. What he has that none of the others did is a kind of humorous approach to the character. He takes the role seriously. He's amused with <PERSON> Magnolia </PERSON> when he first meets her and then that amusement becomes affection. `` I also love <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>,'' he adds. `` She's young, fresh and innocent and then in the second act, she takes command, like she should, as a mature woman. `` But the role of Cap' n <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> is the spoke of the wheel. He's the dynamo, the propeller of the showboat. He holds it together. He's the most important element in the musical, and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> understood that completely. `` Show Boat'' has had several major revivals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the years, the last being a version done by the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Grand Opera at the Gershwin Theater in 1983. And last year there was renewed interest in the musical with the release of a complete recording of the show by musical theater historian and conductor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>. The recording of more than three hours of material contains nearly every song written for `` Show Boat,'' both stage and movie versions. <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> applauds <PERSON> McGlinn </PERSON>'s effort but says a stage version of `` Show Boat'' with all the cut material reinstated is unwise and unnecessary. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> has done a great service by doing that record for students of the theater,'' <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> says. `` But when people of talent and experience write songs for musical shows and then go on the road, the idea is to make the show better and better. In the course of doing that, they will frequently remove some material and add others. `` To suddenly say, ` Here are all the songs that were cut from the show. Are n't they wonderful?' Well, some of them are wonderful, but they do n't belong in the show.'' The new television version virtually follows the original staging, says <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON>, except for the addition of `` Ah Still Suits Me,'' a comic duet for <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Queenie </PERSON>. The song was added to the 1936 movie version for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> is a passionate champion of `` Show Boat.'' It began, he says, the great age of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> musicals, an era that later saw `` Oklahoma!'' and `` Carousel,'' written by his father and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. That era continued with <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>'s `` My Fair Lady'' and may have ended with `` Fiddler on the Roof'' by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON>. `` I think ` Show Boat' has qualities about it that are lasting, like some of the great operas,'' he says. `` There was a period when the French wrote great operas, there was a period when the Italians wrote great operas, and I think the same thing happened with the American musical. It came into its own in the 1930s and developed during the 1940s and 1950s, and in the'60s the musical sort of faded out.''

 <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the girl who sings about `` The Boy Next Door'' in `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' was one of the most sought-after roles of the new Broadway season. And one of the most difficult to cast. `` Impossible to cast,'' insists <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, a top Broadway casting agent and the man who helped put the performers on stage in `` Rumors'' and `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' two of last season's biggest hits `` You have to find someone to play a role that was created expressly for <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, referring to the legendary singer who was <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> in the memorable 1945 film version. `` What you have to do is not even try,'' he says. `` You have to find someone who can play <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, producer and director of the lavish musical, goes a step further. `` I was looking for somebody who had her own personality that would make us forget <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>,'' he says. During a 15-month, cross-country expedition, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> saw some 2,500 actresses. They had to listen to what seemed like never-ending renditions of `` The Boy Next Door,'' `` Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' and `` The Trolley Song,'' the show's best-known numbers `` Today, if I hear ` The Trolley Song,' I recoil in horror,'' <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> sighs. Among the first performers to audition back in June 1988 was a former Junior Miss runner-up named <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, best known to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> audiences as pert, tap-dancing little Ruby in the 1985 revival of `` Dames at Sea.'' She did n't know it then, but she was <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s first choice for the role `` The very first day I saw her, I knew there was a magic there that was pretty extraordinary,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> says now. `` That was my gut reaction. `` And <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> actually was quite clever. She wore a very lovely white lace dress with a blue sash around her waist that seemed to fit the character. It impresses me when people prepare themselves for auditions.'' But <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> felt they had to continue the search, looking at everyone who wanted to audition. So <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> did n't meet again with <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> until February, when she auditioned twice more with a series of different actors being considered for other roles in the musical. `` You do everything over again,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> says now. `` I sang the same songs. I worked on a few more scenes. I was matched up with different boys next door, sisters, mothers and fathers.'' When it finally looked as if the show would arrive late last season, financial problems forced its postponement until this fall. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> went off to do `` Show Boat'' with the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and a successful concert of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s `` Babes in Arms'' at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. When she returned to `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' there was a fourth audition at the <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON> and then a final audition with <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>, the actor chosen to play <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, the boy next door. `` Sometimes I thought it was really going to happen,'' she recalls. `` And other times, I would say, ` No, you ca n't count on things until it is definite.''' It became definite only in late summer. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> picked her to appear in the musical with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who play her parents, <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, who is her grandfather, and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who plays the Irish cook <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>. The stage version of `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' on view at <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION>'s Gershwin Theater, has been trumpeted as a family show, an old-fashioned American musical, something Broadway has n't had for a while. Its songwriters, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blane </PERSON>, have expanded on their original movie score, adding 10 new songs. `` They definitely do n't write music like this any more,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> says. `` The songs have melodies that are not only catchy and memorable but emotional, too. `` There's a whole new bridge section to ` The Boy Next Door' which will be a surprise to people,'' she says `` And there's a new duet that <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and the boy next door sing called ` You Are for Loving.' It's a beautiful melody, with a wonderful counterpoint.'' `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>'' is <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s first chance to originate a role on Broadway. She had come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984 after graduating from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> as a political science major, but she had two summers of stock in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> while in college. `` It's helped me in the theater to have a liberal arts education,'' she says. `` As an actor, you have to analyze the text critically. Besides, you ca n't just focus on the performing arts.'' Her first job in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was in a small musical called `` Madison Avenue,'' for which she answered an ad in the trade papers. The job called for a Seven Sisters graduate and she fit the bill. Next came `` Dames at Sea,'' which kept her occupied for nearly a year. After that, there were productions of shows like `` My One and Only'' in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was n't idle while she waited for word from <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. She performed in a show in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, went on tour with `` Grease'' and moved to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for four months with her husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Staples </PERSON>, an oil trader. Born in <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, she was raised on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Her parents were in education, not show business. `` My grandfather was a singer on the radio in the 1930s and'40s,'' she says. `` I have his legacy, a piano, which is one of my most cherished possessions.'' The best advice <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> ever got from a voice teacher was when she was 8 years old. The teacher told her mother, `` She's not doing anything wrong. Leave her alone.'' `` I was fortunate that I never had a style or technique imposed on me,'' she says now. She does n't worry about the comparisons to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. `` I have not watched the movie on purpose during the rehearsal process,'' she says. `` Growing up, I'd seen it many times, of course. Some people in the cast have watched the film, others have n't. But we're not trying to compare ourselves to it. `` I'm just trying to concentrate on the character of <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, not who played it. She's a very honest and very sincere person and to be able to produce that vocally as well as act it out is just great.''

<TEXT>
 Campaigning is under way for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first presidential election by popular vote in 29 years, but candidates are concentrating more on clean government than the country's perilous economic problems. On Nov. 15, about 82 million voters will be eligible to pick a successor to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, the first civilian president since a military coup in 1964 routed the left-leaning populist <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> took office as a result of a vote by an electoral college. About 73 percent of the electorate _ Brazilians under the age of 47 _ will be voting directly for a president for the first time in their lives. Also for the first time, Brazilians as young as 16 will be allowed to vote; about 3.3 million 16 - and 17-year-olds have registered but they are not required by law to vote as are those 18 and over <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is seen by many here and abroad as a nation teetering on the edge of economic, financial and social chaos and which way it goes depends heavily on the outcome of the election. `` There is a profound revolt against the political, economic and social system that has n't been able to meet the people's expectations,'' said <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaguaribe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> `` This is the last chance for finding a rational solution. If the next government can not deal adequately with this built-up crisis, the tendency is for the country to degenerate into chaos and hyperinflation and to become ungovernable.'' The last presidential election in 1960 saw the election of <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON>, who served just eight months before resigning in August 1961 and setting off a chain of events that led to the 1964 military takeover. Since that time, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has become the Western world's eighth-largest economy But its foreign debt has soared from $ 2 billion to $ 110 billion _ the largest in the Third World. Its annual inflation rate has soared to 1,200 percent and the minimum wage has eroded to the equivalent of $ 17.50 a week. Many Brazilians are dissatisfied with <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a 59-year-old rancher and poet who has headed the civilian government since a military regime stepped aside in 1985. His leadership is blamed for the soaring inflation and corruption, which indisputably in Brazilian minds has hit almost every level of his administration. But popular resentment runs deeper. `` The powerful sense of opposition in this election is not so much against <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> himself as against parties, politicians and the whole political establishment,'' <PERSON> Jaguaribe </PERSON> said. As a result, the candidates focus on change and clean government. Issues such as how to repay the foreign debt have become secondary. `` I want to rebuild this country stone by stone, brick by brick,'' front-runner <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> said in a recent campaign speech. Other candidates have made similar promises in generalized terms. Twenty-two candidates are on the ballot. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, former governor of the poor northeastern state of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> and one of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s harshest critics, gained national attention by firing state employees with exorbitant salaries, popularly known as `` maharajas.'' Riding a new wave of popularity, he formed the center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 and entered the presidential race. `` I will get rid of the ` maharajas' of the financial system and build a new <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> without inflation, without maharajas and without corruption,'' he told a recent rally. However, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s standing in the polls skidded from 44 percent in August to 34 percent in early October, after the press published charges of shady financial dealings and political cronyism in his own administration in <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION>. His closest challenger is <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state and a backer in the 1960s of <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulart </PERSON>. Because of his associatons with <PERSON> Goulart </PERSON>, who is now dead, <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> fled into exile after the military coup but returned under a 1979 amnesty. He still faces opposition within the armed forces. `` <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> as president means change,'' he said in a campaign speech. `` It will be the beginning of the end for the present economic model of colonial capitalism, which was imposed by the right and, recently, shoved down our throats by the dictatorship.'' He scored 14 percent in October's polls. Other major candidates: _ <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the Marxist-oriented Workers Party: A congressman and former metalworkers union leader, he says he would redistribute land and wealth, proposes a suspension of payments on the foreign debt and calls for an audit of how the borrowed money was spent A front-runner early on, the October polls gave him 9 percent of the vote. _ <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: A millionaire businessman and former governor of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON> promises law-and-order and public works He had the backing of the military in his unsuccessful contest in the electoral college vote for president in 1985. Polls gave him 8 percent of the vote. _ <PERSON> Guilherme </PERSON> <PERSON> Afif </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingos </PERSON> of the right-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: A wealthy businessman, banker and congressman from <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Afif </PERSON> promotes an image as the enlightened pro-business candidate He rose sharply in the October polls to 7 percent and gained nationwide media attention. _ <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON> of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: The speaker of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION> for years led the opposition to the military regime But his close association with <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has hurt his popularity. The polls gave him 4 percent. _ <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Freire </PERSON> of the Brazilian Communist Party: A congressman from the northeastern sugar-growing state of <LOCATION> Pernambuco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Freire </PERSON> is an admirer of the policies of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> But his now-legal party still frightens large numbers of Brazilians. Polls in October gave him just 1 percent. Because <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is so large, with population centers widely scattered, television and radio are playing vital roles in the campaign. The government has ordered all TV and radio stations to carry twice-a-day, 70-minute shows devoted to the candidates and their campaigns. About 100 million of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 145 million people have access to television and the candidates are concentrating heavily on that audience. The result so far has been mostly vague campaign promises: more and better housing, schools, transportation and food production _ with few candidates saying specifically how they would bring about such improvements. Few candidates explain in any detail how they would deal with the economy. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> says he would cut inflation by ending waste and by `` privatizing'' government property. But the only government property he has proposed selling are government mansions in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, now used rent-free by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers. The new president is due to take office March 15 for a five-year term. However, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> is under pressure to step down soon after the election, following the example of neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. There, the outgoing President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, scheduled to leave office in December, handed the presidency to the Peronist <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> in July.

<DATELINE>MAWKE CAMP, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Zaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> says he fled to the jungle after being beaten by soldiers with truncheons in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and seeing a young woman who tried to help him pinned to the ground and killed by a bayonet thrust through her temple. Also at the demonstration in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital, he said, another woman student near him was struck in the head and as she reeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out. <PERSON> Zaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> and other students then came to a conclusion: `` We realized that no peaceful protests, debates or strikes would work. The only course is to resort to arms.'' He and his companions slipped from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> after that demonstration in July and joined nearly 5,000 others who had escaped earlier. They are pledged to fight <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government until democracy is won. But democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for the millions of Burmese who marched in the streets last year and faced the blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising in September 1988. Since then a 17-member junta, the State Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, has wielded power. It has promised elections next May and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form, but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents and silenced the main opposition leaders. After the council took power, the first wave of about 10,000 protesters, leaving wives and families behind, sought the protection of ethnic minority rebels along <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s rugged borders with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About half of them returned, however, enticed by a government promise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease, malnutrition and other hardships. But the border movement did not falter as some had predicted. The military council initially tried to make amends with an angry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally. It allowed the daughter of national hero <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> to campaign and draw huge crowds. But in late July when protests broke out and speeches by <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> grew increasingly strident, the military struck again. She was placed under house arrest and martial law was tightened. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> charged that political detainees were being tortured. A second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers, describing <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> as a prison where people feared the military intelligence and the nighttime knock on the door. The release of <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> was one of the demands of two pro-democracy students who hijacked an Burmese airliner to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> with 83 others on board Oct. 6. The students surrendered to Thai authorities after the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> rejected their demands for a return to democracy. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claims a membership of more than 4,800 students, young professionals, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and others at 24 border camps. Compared to a year ago, they appear to be tougher and better organized but also largely forgotten by the rest of the world. `` We have a rough journey ahead of us,'' said the front's general secretary, Than Win Some students contrast their own status to that of students who fled military repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in June. The Chinese are given scholarships at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other universities and international platforms to voice their protests. The few <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students who tried have had difficulties entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and recently <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, eager for economic deals with the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government, expelled those who had crossed into its territory. Life is marginal at camps like the one here at <LOCATION> Mawke </LOCATION>, a base for 260 students who fight alongside the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of many ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Set in a forest near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> frontier, the camp is a collection of crudely fashioned thatch huts, offering little protection from monsoon rains. Two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket and there are few mosquito nets. Leaders say 75 percent of the student soldiers have suffered from malaria; each can obtain only about $ 3.50 worth of food rations a month. The Karen-trained students at <LOCATION> Mawke </LOCATION> have only about 100 weapons of assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely would run out in about 10 minutes of combat. They acknowledge they could not face a main force Burmese unit without <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> help. Student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeper inside <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> where they claim to be warmly received. Units pass out leaflets, give talks, entertain and help villagers clear trails, dig latrines and build small schools. An hour's walk from <LOCATION> Mawke </LOCATION>, the student front has built a school for its own members. Opened Aug. 1 as the `` Jungle University,'' its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the students teaches political science, English, Thai, basic medicine, agriculture and other subjects. The students hope the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will pass legislation that would provide them up to $ 2.25 million worth of assistance to supplement the meager funds they now receive from various Burmese exile groups and other private donors. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and much of the inernational community have shunned <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> politically since last year but the military government has been able to attract some investors by opening the country to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quarter century. Critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currency being earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnic minorities with whom the students are allied. Although one Western diplomat based in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said that `` the students have been wrecked or driven to the border into irrelevance,'' other analysts give more balanced assessments and the student front sees itself at the forefront of the pro-democracy fight. The front's chairman, <PERSON> Htun </PERSON> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON>, said that despite the sweeping arrests of dissidents, the border camps can maintain links with underground, anti-government cells in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Their own ranks, he said, could easily be swelled from the interior but this is discouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx. `` We are young, brave and we are not selfish,'' the chairman added in an interview. `` Students are the only ones the people trust. We give the people inside courage and can tell the outside world what is happening in our country.'' Students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> politics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura of future leadership. Last February, 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge to end authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixed in a silver cup. It was the same ritual <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s nearly legendary `` Thirty Comrades'' went through during World War II when they pledged to liberate the country from the British.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Old Gringo,'' ``Thelonius Monk: Straight No Chaser''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Old Gringo'' Movie-making in the grand tradition returns with `` Old Gringo,'' a richly textured adventure of revolution and passion. It is graced with a truly magnificent performance by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> as the tormented author-reporter <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>. Unfortunately, the film is flawed by the ambivalence of a major character and an ending that dissipates the dramatic values. What happened to <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, who disappeared during the 1916 Mexican revolution? The distinguished Mexican author <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> speculated in his novel `` Gringo Viejo,'' and <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puenzo </PERSON> elaborated on his fable in their screenplay. The story is fiercely ironic and novelistic, but strangely constructed as a screen entertainment. Most of the excitement is contained in the first third of the film. Thereafter, it bogs down in a romantic triangle that is resolved anticlimactically. The characters are drawn in bold colors. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spinster who breaks away from her mother's firm control to work as schoolmarm for rich Mexican landowners. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> is the fiery iconoclast <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, so depressed by the failure of his literary career that he courts death amid the violence of the revolution. A bold lieutenant of <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> -LRB- `` L.A. Law'' -RRB- is a fearless leader of the peasant uprising. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> arrives at the landowners' compound to find it under siege by the peasant army, the owners having fled. She stays on, in sympathy with the peasants' cause and awed by the powerful personalities of the revolutionary leader and the sardonic journalist. Both seek her virginity, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> hesitantly, <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> with passion. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puenzo </PERSON>, whose admirable Argentine-made `` The Official Story'' won the 1986 Academy Award as best foreign language film, deftly interprets the human relationships. He also handles action with skill; the siege of the compound is worthy of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. But it happens early in the movie. The rest of the film is devoted to the moral dilemma of the revolutionary. The bastard son of the landowner, he struggles like a rough-hewn <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> over whether to claim his heritage or join <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> as ordered. When he finally makes up his mind, he reacts with senseless violence. The best element of `` Old Gringo'' is <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> in the title role. It is fascinating to watch an old pro in the peak of form, playing a character who befits his stature. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, whose company made the film, registers strongly after she abandons her wide-eyed wonder. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>, despite his character's indecision, establishes himself as a big-screen star. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' release was produced by <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonfiglio </PERSON>, with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisnievitz </PERSON> as executive producer. Rating is R for language, violence and a bedroom scene. Running time: 119 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser'' Thelonious Sphere Monk lived up to his name. He practiced ascetism in his spareness with words and notes. A documentary about the jazz composer and pianist _ `` Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser'' _ respects that spareness by focusing on <PERSON> Monk </PERSON>'s legacy to American music, the joy he took in creating a new kind of jazz. This is no artsy movie filled with chitchat about Monk and how he was such a mysterious character and how he revolutionized jazz and all that. It does n't dispel all of the mystery his persona projected, but it does allow us to listen to a lot of his music and to realize his genius. If Monk was n't much interested in making small talk or even communicating with those around him, it's clear he was absorbed in his musical world. `` I mean it is hard work to play those 88'' piano keys, <PERSON> Monk </PERSON> tells some reporter type who asks a dumb question about whether the piano has enough keys. As a documentary, `` Straight, No Chaser'' -LRB- also the name of a famous Monk tune -RRB- suffers from a lack of good footage. The early years are shown in a succession of stills that do n't tell much except that <PERSON> Monk </PERSON> was a revolutionary who wore suits and ties. However, it's sheer pleasure to watch and listen to duo piano performances by <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> that underline the beauty of Monk's music. Tenor saxophonist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, who played with Monk for more than a decade, says that `` Thelonius was like a founder. ... he laid down the foundation'' of modern jazz, called bebop in the beginning. Fortunately, in 1967 West German television commissioned documentary filmmaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON> to do a cinema verite special on Monk. The 14 hours of film from that one-time broadcast forms the basis of much of the film; unfortunately, too much of that footage is shots of Monk and his family and fellow musicians in airports and hotels. To the stock footage, co-producers <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwerin </PERSON> -LRB- who also directed -RRB- and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricker </PERSON> added interviews with <PERSON> Monk </PERSON>'s longtime associate, tenor saxophonist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>; his son, <PERSON> Thelonius </PERSON> <PERSON> Monk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; and his longtime manager, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Colomby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, a lifelong jazz lover, is executive producer for the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release. Rated PG-13. _ By <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Checking Out'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R -RRB- <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON> is perfectly healthy but obsessed with the certainty he's about to die. His pursuit of an illness to cure makes `` Checking Out'' very funny and very strange, just right for a night at home. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, with his classic good looks, is wonderful as <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>, whose life is thrown off kilter when his jokester pal drops dead at a barbecue just before telling the punchline. <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>'s maudlin attitude hits his wife, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayron </PERSON> -RRB-, whom he virtually ignores except to tell her not to use salt, and his boss -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> -RRB-, who suddenly is faced with a crazed employee. The boss tries to calm <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON> with such words of wisdom about his friend's death as: `` It's the hotel of life. You check out and they come and make up the room.'' When <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON> actually faces death, he imagines a heaven that looks like a tacky beach resort and offers all the freedom of a strict grammar school. Jokes about death pervade the movie, and if they are a bit off-putting at the start, they become endearing and actually in the end serve to celebrate the joy of life. The acting is fine, with everyone treating the bizarre material as if it was most ordinary. Careful viewers can catch <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of the Talking Heads in a small role as a bartender. `` Checking Out'' was written by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Eszterhas </PERSON> -LRB- `` Flashdance'' and `` Jagged Edge'' -RRB- and directed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> -LRB- `` Wish You Were Here'' -RRB-. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Say Anything'' -LRB- CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated PG-13 -RRB- In `` Say Anything,'' a pair of blushing teen-agers fall ... oh, do n't say it, ummm, well ... really? No? Really? Oh, I'm so happy! I love you, too! It's that kind of movie. It's predictable. But it's tender. And it accurately captures those awkward, lovely, painful moments of being both in love and a teen-ager. The story centers on Lloyd -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> -RRB-, a likeable guy who is a little low on ambition, and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ione </PERSON> <PERSON> Skye </PERSON> -RRB-, school valedictorian, hyper-achiever and a striking beauty. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s pals call her `` a brain, a brain trapped in the body of a game show hostess.'' The romance would flourish if were n't for <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>'s over-protective father When dad asks about <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s goal in life, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> says point-blank that it's to spend as much time possible with his daughter. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who wrote `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' makes his directing debut with `` Say Anything'' and wonderfully captures off-beat and witty nuances of teen tribulations. There is, for instance, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> friend who wrote 65 songs about her boyfiend <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> _ who dumped her. In another scene, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> gets an earful of advice from the boys hanging out a convenience store parking lot. That leads <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> to ask them why, if they know so much about women, are they at a Gas-n-Sip on a Saturday night. The big flaw is an annoying competitive sub-plot concerning <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>'s father, who is in trouble with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It nags on the main plot of the struggling romance like a bad habit. But love endures and this charming film overcomes its plot problems to leave viewers feeling warm and fuzzy, but hardly surprised. __ By <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Raw Like Sushi'' -LRB- Virgin -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Neneh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> In the post-Madonna era, dance-oriented female singers seem a dime a dozen. But newcomer <ORGANIZATION> Neneh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> seems to have the talent to stand out in the crowd. The young London-based singer's `` Raw Like Sushi'' is a fresh mix of pop, rap and house music with a bravado sure to appeal to girls growing up in a changing world. The debut album has a shimmering urban sound, firmly contemporary but avoiding the cliches that are rife in this genre. Cherry samples a variety of `` found sounds,'' such as <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>'s `` Buffalo Girls'' on her own `` Buffalo Stance'' and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>'s `` Living for the City.'' Cherry, herself a mother, sternly defends the rights of children on `` The Next Generation.'' She calls on fathers to stand up for their parental responsibilities and society to fix crumbling school systems. `` What's this sitting on my lap?'' she asks. `` It's the next generation.'' `` Buffalo Stance'' is already a hit and `` Kisses on the Wind'' is high on the charts now, both deservedly so. `` Manchild,'' a ballad with a combination of singing and rapping, and the tough-minded `` Heart'' are both noteworthy. Cherry is a serviceable singer but an even better rapper, with a sassy style. If she's not yet ready to challenge <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> for her crown, at least Cherry can keep the blond one company on the charts for awhile. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Missa Prolationum, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Motets </PERSON> by <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ockeghem </PERSON>; The Hilliard Ensemble -LRB- EMI -RRB- Little is known about <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ockeghem </PERSON>, 1420-1477. He spent much of his adult life serving the kings of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and achieved a lofty reputation among musicians of the day and in later centuries. Ockeghem's total known output consists of 20 chansons, 12 masses, three partial masses and a handful of motets. He also came to have the reputation of dry academician because of his mastery of composition. The beauty of this Mass shows clearly the opposite, especially with the feeling interpretation by the <ORGANIZATION> Hilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>, made up of two altos, three tenors, a baritone and two basses. The Missa Prolationum, perhaps Ockeghem's greatest work, is a landmark: the first mass to use a canon, or successively repeated melody, in all its parts. Paired, or individual, voices sing the same melody but in different meters and intervals. In the bigger picture of music history, Ockeghem represents a new kind of musical thinking, a departure from the idea of a basic melody around which music is constructed, and a move towards using an idea-generating theme that unifies an entire piece's development. The performance here is just right. The atmosphere is other-worldly and serene, but not cold. The singers are absolutely precise in their joint entrances and phrase-endings. Chords burst forth like a flood of light through a cathedral's rose window, and solo voices weave a tapestry of sound. One minor caveat: Perhaps because of the recording conditions, sybillant consonants seem to jump out of the texture, creating a distracting effect. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 They come from different backgrounds a generation apart, but <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> have one thing in common: They both suffer stage fright. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> gets stage fright after 45 years in films? `` I always do,'' confesses the 73-year-old star who portrays the iconoclastic author <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON> in `` Old Gringo,'' co-starring with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>. `` When I went down to rehearse in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, I was playing catchup, because originally <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> was to play the role. They were already rehearsing, and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> knew all of her lines backwards, forwards and sideways, while I was carrying a script in my hand. When we first rehearsed a scene, she embraced me. Her tears were flowing, and I was trying to hold onto my script,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> was totally into the scene, and I was about 8,000 miles behind. I had a bit of stage fright the first day or two. That happens with every movie. Nothing unusual about that.'' <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>, 33, had more reason to be nervous. He was making the leap from TV's `` L.A. Law'' to a $ 24 million epic with two screen legends. `` I would be lying to you if I said I was n't nervous the first couple of days of shooting,'' he said. `` Besides the fact that I was working with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, on the first couple of days I was involved in an exterior scene that had 150 extras. I was on a horse, carrying a rifle and I spoke in two different languages. It was an exercise in shifting lots of gears at the same time. `` I went home that first night and I cried a little bit, because I did n't think I was up to spec. But they liked what I did.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> speaks well of his young co-star: `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> is well-trained and schooled, holds a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- University -RRB- in fine arts, has worked with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>, has done <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> in the Park, has done the classics. He's studied voice, he's studied movement, he's a trained young artist. He's ready for bigger things. He's wonderful in ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,' but he's going to be a movie star.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> grew up in idyllic <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the lonely son of a divorced druggist. He became interested in acting while studying pre-med at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. He later went East to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse. After a few stage roles, he was signed to contracts with <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON> and RKO and became an instant star. A host of memorable roles followed, `` To Kill a Mocking Bird'' winning him the Academy Award in 1962. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'s film roles have been sparse in recent years, but he welcomed the challenge of playing the enigmatic <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, who wrote `` The Devil's Dictionary.'' `` He was pretty much a misanthrope,'' the actor said. `` I think that he had great love for his family and treated them badly and knew that he had. I think he had great remorse about the shambles of his personal life. Also, he was disappointed and disillusioned by the failure of his 12-volume collected works. `` It was in that rather gloomy mood that he decided first to go on a nostalgic tour of the Civil War battlefields in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> where he fought as a young man; he was born in 1840. Then on to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, and he decided, ` Well, it's not to late for excitement.' He decided to join the <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> revolution. He got as far as <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, bought a white horse and set off across the desert in search of a band of revolutionaries. He disappeared from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' `` Old Gringo'' is based on the <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> novel that fictionizes Bierce's fate. The director is Argentine <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puenzo </PERSON>, whose `` The Official Story'' won an Oscar. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> has no plans to heat up his film career. `` I'm working as much as I like,'' he commented. `` I do n't want to do, if I can avoid it, anything mediocre. It's kind of unseemly at my age to come out in a turkey. So I'm just going to sit back. `` My wife and I are globetrotters; we get around a lot. I've had fun the last couple of weeks. At the house I've had a stonemason, a painter, a plumber who's got to come back ... also a tree surgeon. I like that kind of thing: nest-building. `` I've got four kids who are all doing interesting things,'' he said. `` One son is a banker and a free-fall parachute jumper, another is making a documentary right now in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. My daughter is appearing with the <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> dance company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and my son <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> has just sold a screenplay to <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. I follow all of them with great interest, and it's probably the most fun I have.'' <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> came from a different background. He was born in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, son of a Puerto Rican mother and a father from <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>. He was one of three children of a family of `` lower-middle-class laborers.'' `` We moved around a lot when I was young,'' he recalled. `` That had something to do with my becoming an actor. I did n't have a lot of lasting friendships. I played a lot by myself. I made-believe a lot. I think that was where the -LRB- acting -RRB- germ was planted. Along the way there were people who influenced me to continue my education if I was interested in theater. `` The fascinating thing is that in acting on any given day you can be a king or a beggar. I found that I could channel my energy into research. I was never a very good student, but when it related to a role, I could spend hours in the library researching 18th century <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' Besides <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> plays, <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> appeared in the films `` Running Scared'' and `` The Believers,'' then was cast as the dedicated lawyer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sifuentes </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' That, he admitted, accelerated his career. `` In terms of notoriety and success as an actor, most definitely,'' he said. `` I had been working a lot off-Broadway and in regional theater, but ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law' was really a turning point, and a good one.''

 Metropolitan Opera soprano <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>'s next production will be a baby. She once watched a TV program in which baritone <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> interviewed renowned sopranos who have sung `` Tosca'' and recalls that several said they decided not to have children because it would interrupt their careers. But <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, who is married to musicologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nott </PERSON>, always wanted a family and is expecting her baby in November. `` I think that has always been first and will always come first. I'm not really as eager to get out there to do as much as I can and sing in every country.'' She thinks maybe in 10 years she'll even stop traveling to sing and start teaching. Though her husband travels with her, visiting libraries and writing wherever they are, they're both ready to go home after six or seven weeks away from their apartment near <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. Without trying too hard to sing abroad, though, <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> receives engagements. She sang Pamina in `` The Magic Flute'' with the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> last fall and was engaged for her debut in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> next fall, singing Pamina. `` I'm glad to get to these two cities,'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> says. `` They're important opera houses. It'll be easy traveling with a baby. I want to take advantage of traveling while it's easier.'' Her last long performing trip was seven weeks in <LOCATION> Aix-en-Provence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, singing <PERSON> Despina </PERSON> in `` Cosi fan tutti.'' She also sang Pamina, while six months pregnant. `` By that time I was feeling a fair amount of movement,'' she said. `` At one point I was sort of thrown down on the floor as I was singing Pamina. I supported myself well with my hands on the way down. I had to lie there several seconds. The baby would always kick. ` Get off of me!''' A month later she sang <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> in `` The Marrige of Figaro'' at <LOCATION> Wolftrap </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` It's her wedding day. She's not supposed to be pregnant,'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> says. So the company padded her into general plumpness. In September she went to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to sing a concert with the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, a recital at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, her alma mater, and at a friend's wedding. After college, where she concentrated on concert and recital work more than opera, her teacher -LRB- and father of her now husband -RRB-, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nott </PERSON>, suggested she audition for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voice teacher <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Faull </PERSON>. She did and entered the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> as a <LOCATION> Faull </LOCATION> pupil. `` I still study with her. I can take anything to her that I'm concerned about and trust her opinion probably more than my own,'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Faull </PERSON>'s suggestion was that <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> enter the Metropolitan Opera Auditions for <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singers </ORGANIZATION> so that one of the judges, who runs the Met's young artists development program, would hear her. The strategy worked. In the 1984-85 season, <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> was taken into the program, which yearly puts half a dozen fledgling singers on the Met stage in small roles, training them for major parts. <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>'s Met debut was as <PERSON> Countess </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceprano </PERSON> in `` Rigoletto.'' `` She's a flirt who has about two lines. She flirts with the Duke a little bit in the opening scene. Then her husband comes in and she's sent home.'' She sang five roles that season and remembers best one performance as the fifth serving woman in `` Elektra.'' `` I loved that music,'' she said. `` I had several pages by myself. It was really exciting.'' She was `` covering'' that part, meaning that she went on if the scheduled singer fell ill. In her second season she sang <ORGANIZATION> Barbarina </ORGANIZATION> in `` The Marriage of <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>.'' `` That was an important step forward for me,'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said. `` She has a little aria by herself. There was more dramatic work on stage. It was really my first time spent with -LRB- Met artistic director -RRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. I think, thanks to <LOCATION> Barbarina </LOCATION>, he had enough confidence in me to offer other interesting roles. He brought my singing to the public a little sooner than it would otherwise have been brought.'' The biggest part she has had at the Met was the female lead, <PERSON> Adina </PERSON>, in `` The Elixir of Love'' two seasons ago. `` I was covering <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> for a run of four,'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said. `` She canceled all of them, the first one an hour before it began. I was singing a smaller part in the opera. I was leaving the apartment when I got a phone call saying she was sick and I would have to go on. `` I remember trying to switch gears to the lead. It was really terrifying. Some people thrive on that sort of thing. Their adrenaline gets going and they're very animated and comfortable. Not having ever walked on the set before that night, not having sung any bit of it with the orchestra _ I do n't want to do that again. I was not loose and carefree. I was definitely stiff and nervous. `` Everything turned out OK, especially by the third or fourth performance.'' This season at the Met, <ORGANIZATION> Upshaw </ORGANIZATION> will sing Zerlina in `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>,'' starting in March. `` I was supposed to sing <PERSON> Despina </PERSON>, too, in January,'' she said. `` I recently pulled out. I wanted to give myself more time after the baby. They were nice about it. People are very understanding when it's a baby.''

 A Scottish band called `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' is bound to cause some confusion. First of all, the group's name comes from the film `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' not the state. Also, their music shows no trace of Scottish roots, drawing instead on the folk and blues of such Americans as Ry Cooder and <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. That's one reason their debut album, `` Southside,'' took so long to make. As singer <PERSON> Sharleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> explained, finding a producer capable of understanding the viewpoints of four determined young musicians was nearly impossible. `` We had the songs arranged for a long time and we really just needed someone to get us in the mood,'' said <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>, 21, `` but the producers always wanted to add a few keyboards or even a saxophone. `` We just believed in our sound. We were very stubborn. We welcomed suggestions, but there were too many people. It becomes the producer and record company on one side, and the band on the other. It's like a conveyor belt: ` OK, this band wo n't get a record so we'll go the next band.''' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> explained, is willing to take orders, but only if you ask nicely. The members prefer sitting down and discussing ideas, coming to decisions that reflect everyone's input. `` It's a lot different from one person,'' <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said. `` With four people you get different ideas, you get some interesting conversations. Maybe they'll change my mind on bits and pieces, maybe I'll change theirs. It's good we are a band that's able to talk.'' They know how fortunate they are to just have a record. Growing up in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, unemployment was a stubborn fact of life from which music provided a cherished escape. `` I came out of school and luckily enough got a job as a hairdresser,'' <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said. `` I started off with just a Saturday job and then managed to get full-time work. A lot of people thought because I had such a secure job, one that a lot of people in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> would give their right arm for, I was crazy to give it up for a career in music.'' `` My dad's unemployed,'' guitarist <PERSON> Ally </PERSON> <PERSON> McErlaine </PERSON> said. `` Because of the class structure and everything, it's geared to keeping the working classes down and stopping people from getting anywhere. You ca n't get a good job. But for playing in a band, we did n't have to have any sort of background.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was formed in the spring of 1987 when a friend introduced <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> to bassist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhone </PERSON>. They quickly wrote `` I Do n't Need a Lover,'' the album's first single, which opens with a slide guitar influenced by <PERSON> Cooder </PERSON>'s soundtrack for `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' `` A lot of the people think the album's about old relationships,'' said <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>, who cited <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> as influences. `` ` I Do n't Want a Lover' is male-female, but it's also about everything that's happened to us, the high unemployment in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the fact a lot of our family and friends are unemployed.'' Getting a record deal was, surprisingly, the easy part for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who now had <PERSON> McErlaine </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> aboard. The band signed with <PERSON> Phonogram </PERSON> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But making the album was an unwelcome lesson in the blues, starting when the young group headed for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to work with producer <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, the former bassist for Chic. `` It never got very far,'' <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said. `` We worked for a month and it was still very basic. We came back very upset. We were thinking how we spent so much money and so much time.'' They eventually hooked up with <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who had produced former Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION> singer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plant </PERSON> among others. `` It was quite a relief,'' <PERSON> McErlaine </PERSON> said. `` We were getting on well and he was bringing more out of it. He just let us do our thing. There were a lot of battles working with other producers and we knew we had to try someone else.'' Everyone contributes to the songs, usually written around a guitar riff or bass pattern. `` Ally will make changes and maybe I'll change something and from that point we'll rehearse it and see what happens,'' <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said. `` Over the past 2 -LCB- years, all the things that have happened forced us to put them into the songs. The feelings brought on by all the producers and studios rubbed off.'' `` Prayer for You,'' `` Faith'' and `` The Future Is Promises'' all reflect the group's struggle to make the record. <PERSON> McErlaine </PERSON> called that spirit a product of their upbringing, the determination to work hard and not compromise. <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> talked of `` Prayer for You'' and its words of encouragement: `` I could never watch you suffer, I could never let you down. And I hope you soon discover, all the truth that I've now found.'' `` ` Prayer for You' was the last song we wrote for the album,'' the singer recalled. `` It was a very basic acoustic guitar and vocal that we took it into the studio and jammed on. Everything came out on it, it was a relief. `` Everything was coming to a head at that point. We had people saying, ` Oh God, are they going to do it?' You felt that everybody was thinking, ` Can these people work with anyone else?' All these people were coming in with ideas. But it's not their record, it's ours.

 Who was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, the white supremacist who declared war on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and led a major terrorist campaign throughout the American West? <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON> spent four years tracking his movements and those of his four dozen followers, and pieced together a written patchwork quilt that provides some insight into this group and its activities. Their book, `` The Silent Brotherhood,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> MacMillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is more than a chronology of events that includes the slaying of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio talk show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> in a burst of machine-gun fire in 1984. It explores the underground group's thinking, way of life and the passions that drove followers to rob armored cars, blow up churches and take on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, which they branded the `` Zionist Occupation Government,'' or ZOG for short. It's a tale of bravado and intrigue, murder and passion. It also details one of the widest, most expensive criminal investigations since the <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> case. By the time it ended, there were 75 arrests in related cases and five deaths. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON>, reporters for the Rocky Mountain News, said the Silent Brotherhood took its name from a poem in a history of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s dreaded Wafen SS. The Silent Brotherhood laid elaborate plans to sabotage dams, water supplies, utilities and communications lines. Its goal was to transform five Western states into an Aryan Nation, free of black and Jewish influence. To finance their plan, members robbed two banks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and launched a career of armored car heists that spread to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They set up a `` doomsday'' assassination squad. If the group was attacked by authorities, it planned to track and kill statesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, banker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> and the heads of the three television networks, all of whom were perceived as enemies because they were either Jewish or worked for Jews. To prove their resolve, they decided to send a message. On June 18, 1984, they stalked and killed <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> outside his <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> was killed because he was Jewish and because he frequently attacked group members on his radio program with his acid-tongued wit. The funds from their robberies grew, and included $ 3.8 million netted in a bold daylight highway robbery near <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. This money was to be shared with other right-wing groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Klan, the White Aryan Resistance in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and the white supremacist group <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The group made a major mistake by leaving behind a gun during a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> heist, and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents tracked <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> to a home near <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where he died in a hail of gunfire and flames during a 36-hour standoff. The story does n't end there. In July 1986 at the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> and his followers were honored with medals that read, `` Should you fall, my friend, another friend will emerge from the shadows to take your place.'' In September 1986, a string of bombings took place in <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, by a group calling itself the Silent Brotherhood Strike Force II. Among those who provided information to the authors were <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, now serving time in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prison, who was convicted in November 1987 of violating <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s civil rights by killing him, and <PERSON> Zillah </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mathew </PERSON>'s lover who is now raising his daughter. The book is remarkable for its details on groups that pride themselves on secrecy. However, it still fails to resolve the one central question, `` Why did they do it?'' The authors attempt to explain it as part of the `` mountain man'' mystique and frontier spirit of the Old West, but that fails to explain the vast allure of groups such as these in the South, with deep roots in the Civil War. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON> acknowledge they are not psychologists, but say they wanted to provide some insight into why racists belong to such groups. `` It's simplistic and easy to put these guys in a jar on a shelf called nuts and not worry about it,'' <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON> said. `` These were real people not a whole lot different than we are. The difference is how they carried it out.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said all supremacist groups have several things in common, such as a charismatic leader, what they view as a superpatriotic attitude and a shared goal of restoring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not destroying it. In the end, the best clue to the thinking of such groups comes from <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> himself, who cheated the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> out of a chance for interrogation by choosing death.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Pound Drops, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mostly lower in early European trading today, but gained more than 2 cents against the British pound. Gold prices were little changed. Currency dealers said trading was quiet because of the Columbus Day holiday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and because Canadian financial institutions were closed for that country's Thanksgiving holiday. Dealers said the market is trying to find new direction after European interest rate hikes, central bank interventions and weaker-than-expected September <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> job figures all failed to take the dollar much lower. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.22 yen to a closing 142.23 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.65 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8862 West German marks, down from 1.8880; 1.6450 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3955 French francs, down from 6.4035; 2.1333 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1350; 1,378.38 Italian lire, down from 1,380.25; 1.1750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1760 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fell. It cost $ 1.5815 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.6030 late Friday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 363.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 363.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 362.95. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 363.00, up from $ 362.80 late Friday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.13 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 5.14. Financial institutions in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> were closed today because of the Chinese <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeung </PERSON> or Grave Sweeping Festival.

 <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is offering early retirement to 1,000 of its employees; <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to reorganize its dairy operations will cost 7,000 jobs, and the megabuyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> will result in more than 1,600 layoffs. Business optimism appears to be dimming, and manufacturers are becoming more aggressive in cutting costs and people. But a relatively steady unemployment rate _ which has fluctuated between 5.1 percent and 5.3 percent since April _ means somebody is hiring. The question is, who? <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Haugen </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, says job growth is concentrated in the service sector, that broad, amorphous category covering everything from data processing to theme parks to the neighborhood beauty parlor. Experts say this sector is creating upwards of 1.5 million jobs a year. `` Services is very labor intensive, so it's sucking up all the workers,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON>, a senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In September alone, when the loss of 103,000 manufacturing jobs inched the unemployment rate up 0.1 percent to 5.3 percent, service industries added 317,000 jobs. A closer look, however, shows teachers returning to their classrooms and the ending of a telephone workers strike were responsible for much of the job increase. But economists point to health care providers, temporary help agencies, hotels and the entertainment industry as being among the most consistent `` net adders'' of employees. The health care industry is growing at just under 10 percent a year, said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a major medical supplies manufacturer in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> added 2,400 jobs in 1988, and <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> said the payroll continues to grow this year Revenue grew 10 percent last year, and sales were up significantly so far this year, he said. Orders to the 6,000 to 7,000 hospitals Baxter supplies are increasing as an aging population requires more medical care. But the fastest growing area of new business for <LOCATION> Baxter </LOCATION> lies in the sale of `` alternate-site'' products, like intravenous solutions and dialysis items used at home and in nursing homes. Overall outpatient care is growing at the rate of about 20 percent annually, said <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON>. On the temporary help scene, <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chief Executive <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> characterized growth as `` meteoric'' over the last five years Since the beginning of this year, <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> said Manpower's permanent staff has increased by 1,000 employees. `` We're increasing the number of offices we operate by 10 percent a year, and we will do at least that going forward,'' he said from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. `` We're adding more offices because we can do more business,'' said <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON>, who noted that the number of people employed temporarily has tripled since 1982. On the entertainment and recreation front, the theme park business is hot. <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has added about 4,000 people to its payroll with the opening of three new attractions at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Disney-MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, Typhoon Lagoon water park and a nighttime entertainment section, said spokesman <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>. In addition to hiring people to staff the new attractions, <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said, increased attendance _ bolstered by an influx of foreign tourists flush with cash thanks to favorable exchange rates _ has spurred <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to create new jobs. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is investing $ 600 million in a <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> movie park that will compete directly with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> when it opens in the spring. On the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans this month to build a $ 700 million movie theme park in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that will employ 7,000 people when it opens, tentatively in late 1992. The lodging industry is also expanding nationwide. In the 12 months ended in June, 60,000 new hotel jobs had been created, <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based hotel chain, is adding 3,000 positions this year because of expansion and acquisitions, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reckert </PERSON>. Although the loss of manufacturing jobs concerns many economists, in part because service sector jobs tend to pay less than industrial work, others do n't see this as a severe problem. They say the manufacturing process has become more efficient and fewer workers are required. `` We should n't be concerned if manufacturing is not growing because we're having a 5 percent -LRB- annual -RRB- increase in output per worker,'' <PERSON> Hekman </PERSON> said. But the service sector has shown very little productivity gains, `` so as the economy grows, we're moving people out of high-productivity areas and moving them into the services,'' he said.

 The Anglo-French consortium which is building the 31-mile rail tunnel under the English Channel said Monday it will cost substantially more to build the link between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The consortium <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> said the tunnel would cost 7 billion pounds, -LRB- about $ 11 billion -RRB-, or 44 percent more than predicted two years ago, largely because of higher than anticipated costs for rail cars. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> Co-chairman <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said last week that the group would have to raise more funds to meet the higher costs, and that it was embroiled in a cost dispute with its major contractor Transmanche-Link, which was pegging costs between 5 percent and 10 percent higher. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said Monday he was sure those difficulties would be sorted out and that talks with <ORGANIZATION> TML </ORGANIZATION> were polite and constructive, contrary to weekend reports that suggested otherwise. `` There is no longer a question of should the project be built. It's going ahead,'' the co-chairman said. `` We would never request government assistance and their answer would be ` no' anyway.'' <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> said it raised its revenue projections by 7 percent for the year 2003 to 819.5 million pounds, or $ 1.29 billion, from 768.4 million pounds and by 8 percent for the year 2013 to 997.4 million pounds from 923.1 million pounds. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> shares, which have fallen sharply since the higher costs were announced, were off 33 pence, or 52 cents, at 535 pence on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Stock Exchange Monday morning. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said the proposed British Rail high-speed rail link joining <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with the tunnel needed to be completed `` as quickly as possible'' to avoid serious congestion on existing networks. On the tunnel work itself, <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> reported that the boring machines had `` not yet reached satisfactory production rate,'' but that modifications were being made. Working from both sides of the channel, workers have dug about half of a service tunnel, but construction of two other tunnels, which will carry trains in opposite directions, has a long way to go. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> says it will complete the project by mid-1993.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Won't Boost Oil Exports Unless OPEC Pact Collapses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A top Iraqi oil official said his country's new extra production capacity will be used only if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreements collapse, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday. <PERSON> Ramzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, told the weekly newsletter that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s new oil capacity `` will help to make people think twice before violating the agreement.'' `` A year ago we did not have that flexibility or that potential, but now we have it and should there be a political decision to use it, we can use it,'' <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could now export more than 4 million barrels a day, well over its <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> daily quota of 2.92 million barrels for the last quarter of this year. Export capacity `` will be developed to bigger volumes and I do n't think producing 4 million barrels is a problem,'' he said. He stressed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s continued commitment to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreements and its desire for firm oil prices, adding: `` We are not interested in lower prices ... revenue maximization is the objective.'' The comments by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> were carried in an interview published by the Nicosia-based newsletter. His warning came at a time when the cartel's 13 member nations are exceeding their production limits under the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly Oil Market Report last week that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pumped about 22.3 million barrels of crude a day in September, the same as in August, while the production ceiling was set at 19.5 million. The cartel has decided to boost production by 1 million barrels a day for the last quarter of the year, raising its overall stated production to 20.5 million. This is still nearly 2 million lower that the actual August-September production level. The average price of oil has hovered around $ 16.82 a barrel, as monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in the last week of September, compared to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s increased export capacity followed the completion of a second phase of a pipeline across <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION>, raising the line's capacity to 1.65 million barrels a day.

Querying 113 of his brethren at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> recently, he found 72 percent of them were n't happy with the quality of data. Many said it was deteriorating. It's worth noting, `` and perhaps a little frightening,'' he observes, that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers that generally are given the most weight by financial decision-makers. He says that because he found his colleagues especially skeptical about the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, which issues the gross national product figures, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION>, whose numbers include retail sales. He did not offer the example that follows, but it probably serves as well as any to illustrate what he is talking about. The illustration relates to economic conditions during mid-year 1986, when much of the country was experiencing economic problems. On July 22 of that year the government reported that second-quarter GNP had grown at a 1.1 percent rate, down sharply from a first-quarter rate of just under 4 percent. The economy was still expanding, it said, but sluggishly. One year later, on July 24, 1987, the report was revised to show a gain of only 0.6 percent. After still another revision, on July 27, 1988, the tiny 0.6 percent growth was turned into an 0.8 percent decline. The revisions continued. On July 27, 1989, a full percentage point was added to the 0.8 percent decline, making for a substantial, 1.8 percent shrinkage of gross national product for the second quarter of 1986. It was n't the only revision. GNP for the third quarter of 1986, initially reported as growth of 1.4 percent, also was revised downward. It became 1 percent in 1988, and only 0.8 percent in the 1989 revision. Should the pattern of downward revisions continue next year, in the summer of 1990, it will mean that way back in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy was in recession. Two back-to-back quarters of GNP shrinkage defines recession. One critic of the government's GNP numbers doubts that it will take place. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, a pioneer in economic measurements, says `` It would be very embarrassing in 1990 to tell <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> it had a recession four years earlier.'' He has a special interest in the changing numbers because, based on data he had assembled and distributed to clients at the time, 31 states making up 49.5 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population were in recession in the second quarter of 1986. The recession states _ associated with minerals, heavy industry, farming, oil and lumber _ knew they were in recession, he said. But much of the country had no idea. In the national numbers, coastal booms offset the negatives. More than embarrassing in all this is the fact that important personal, business and governmental business was affected by the incorrect government numbers. Decisions are made within seconds of the initial announcements. Once made, those decisions forever skew the economy's path. They can not be revised. There may be no easy way to correct the problem. Perhaps most of the revisions made in economic data result from additional information unavailable earlier. Economic information must be timely; it is perishable. Economists interviewed by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who operates under the name <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION>, seemed to suggest that personnel improvements might help. Eighty-two percent of them agreed that insufficient funding and staffing were causes of poor quality. More than half cited data-gathering techniques. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> environment that often leads to political-economic clashes was all but absolved of blame. Relatively few economists, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, believe the quality of federal numbers is damaged by political manipulation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which delivers computerized financial information, said Monday its third-quarter earnings dropped 17.4 percent compared with a year earlier despite a 14.3 percent increase in revenue. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> said it is in negotiations to buy the 50 percent stake that its partner <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns in the joint venture <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transactions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

In its earnings report, <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> said it had net income of $ 19.5 million, or 21 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $ 23.6 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose to $ 127.8 million from $ 112.3 million a year earlier. Subscriptions to the company's services continue to grow although its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business has been hurt by problems in the thrift industry, which is among its groups of customers, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION>. He said earnings were depressed in the third quarter by costs of introduction of the foreign exchange trading service from Global Transactions. Expenses will continue at a relatively high level through the balance of 1989, <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said, and should continue to affect earnings for the rest of the year, but should moderate later as the service generates more revenue.

 Share prices fell sharply Monday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the pound's weakness and fears that the recent hike in British interest rates could lead to a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 30.5 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,247.0, its lowest close since July 10. The index declined throughout the day after opening at its session high of 2,262.8. The index closed only marginally above the day's low of 2,242.6. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended 34.9 points lower at 1,822.9. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 18.94 points to close at 1,250.43. Volume came to 424 million shares, down from Friday's 505.5 million shares. Dealers pointed to sterling's drop below 3.0 West German marks early in the day as the key factor in the market's decline. The weakness in sterling exacerbated the market's concerns over rising British interest rates, which now stand at 15 percent, and chances for recession. But dealers attributed part of the price declines to profit-taking, and said institutions were actively buying the more recession-proof stocks.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders reacted to word the weekend saw the biggest harvest of the season. November and January soybeans drifted to contract lows in light trading, reflecting the harvest news.

Corn prices were pressured by the belief there will be little additional business from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced late Friday that the Soviets have purchased 1.1 million metric tons of corn. There is little prospect of more business from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> said. Wheat prices were undermined by the dashing of rumors that the Soviets would buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. It appears the Soviets would instead try to rely on domestic production, analysts said. The absence of many traders because of the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays tended to depress prices, according to analysts. At the close, wheat was 3 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 \ a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 4 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 11 \ cents lower with November at $ 5.56

 The dollar turned narrowly mixed Monday in thin holiday trading. Gold prices were lower. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 363.10 a troy ounce, down 60 cents from Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 362.50 an ounce, off 75 cents. Currency dealers said trading was subdued and abbreviated because of the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays. The markets in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also closed for a holiday, while trading in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> slowed on the eve of a holiday there. Taking the spotlight Monday was the British pound, which sunk below 3 West German marks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time in 18 months, despite last week's rise in base lending rates in line with similar rate hikes across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealers said they were worried that the British government's anti-inflation strategy might tilt the nation's economy into a recession `` There are no positives for the pound,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Recession is now the center of concern.'' The pound closed at $ 1.5775 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.6030 Friday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5775 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lower than $ 1.6055 on Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.22 Japanese yen to a closing 142.23 yen. It traded at 142.80 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 142.85 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 142.35 yen on Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8875 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6485 Swiss francs, up from 1.6420; 6.3995 French francs, down from 6.4050; 1.17525 Canadian dollars, unchanged; and 1,383.25 Italian lire, unchanged Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Friday included: 1.8865 West German marks, down from 1.8880; 1.6457 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.4005 French francs, down from 6.4035; 2.1310 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1350; 1.1749 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1760; and 1,384.00 Italian lire, up from 1,380.25. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 362.75 an ounce from $ 363.25 Friday, but it was unchanged in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at $ 362.80 an ounce.

 Representatives from <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> continued discussions Monday in an attempt to get <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>'s stalled $ 1.5 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> back on track. The deal was placed in jeopardy last week when <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> revealed that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> failed to make a scheduled $ 50 million down payment. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian resorts and entertainment company, was to have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit for $ 50 million by Sept. 22, one week after <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> outbid media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> by $ 100 million. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, said negotiations over the letter of credit had taken place over the weekend and continued Monday. He said the talks involved a renegotiation of the letter of credit, which is in essence a non-refundable deposit. But <PERSON> Saks </PERSON> described as inaccurate a report Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which said <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> was seeking to increase the amount of the letter of credit to $ 100 million. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said she was unable to make any statement beyond that contained in the company's announcement Thursday of the missed deadline. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> was off for the holiday, a secretary said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, was also out of the office for the day, his secretary said. The protracted negotiations rekindled speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> might be unable to afford the planned purchase. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> officials have said repeatedly that its financing will come in part from a group of 10 Asian and European investors, none of whom have been identified publicly. In a release issued late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> letter of credit had yet to arrive. It added that the companies were talking about modifying their merger agreement concerning `` appropriate security'' from <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>. No change was contemplated in the merger price, the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Earlier last week, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> assured the <ORGANIZATION> Brisbane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> had `` arranged the security'' for the $ 50 million letter of credit. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> had advised it that security had been posted in a bank. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said last month that a major studio needs $ 300 million in capital each year to sustain production and distribution. <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> needs to accumulate two years of operating capital, or $ 600 million, on top of the $ 1.5 billion purchase price. In buying <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> will also assume $ 400 million of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond debt. Including <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>'s production estimates, that would mean that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> will end up spending $ 2.5 billion to acquire and operate <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soybean Prices Plunge Due to Good Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Monday as traders reacted to news that the weekend saw near perfect harvesting conditions. On other markets, cotton prices were sharply lower, precious metals drifted lower, livestock and pork futures were mixed, energy futures were higher and coffee prices continued to drift lower. Trading on the nation's commodity exchanges was thin due to the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holiday. Wheat settled 3 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 \ a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with December at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 7 \ cents to 11 -RCB- cents lower with November at $ 5.56 -RCB- November and January soybeans drifted to contract lows in light trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the harvest news. Adding pressure to prices was the expectation that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s crop report due out Thursday will have an upward revision of the crop production estimate, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Corn prices were pressured by the belief there will be little additional business from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced late Friday that the Soviets have purchased 1.1 million metric tons of corn. There is little prospect of more business from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> said. Wheat prices were undermined by a spillover effect from soybeans and a lack of export demand. Cotton prices closed sharply lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as moderating weather conditions in the delta cotton-growing region prompted profit-taking by commission houses. Weather forecasts had indicated that temperatures would drop below freezing in crop-growing areas over the weekend. However, temperatures remained above freezing. Cotton was .41 cent to 1.47 cents lower with October at 74.53 cents a pound. Precious metal prices were lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar showed strength against other major currencies. Gold was 60 cents to $ 1 lower with October at $ 363.10 a troy ounce; silver was 6.7 cents to 8.7 cents lower with October at $ 5.05 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices finished higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, led by a seasonal push in heating oil. Traders said prices moved in a narrow range throughout the session in what might have been the lightest trading day this year. West Texas Intermediate was 15 cents to 17 cents higher with November at $ 20.02 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .59 ent higher with November at 58.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .19 cent higher with November at 54.99 cents a gallon. Coffee prices continued their decline on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market reacts to the failure last week of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a price support agreement. Prices also were driven down by the abundance of coffee supplies, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Coffee was 1.45 cents to 1.76 cents lower with December at 68.72 cents a pound. Livestock futures closed mostly lower and pork futures were mixed in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures were underpinned by firmer cash prices, but that firmness was undermined somewhat by lower beef cut-out prices. Pork futures were helped by lighter than anticipated movement to market of hogs, analysts said. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .28 cent higher with October at 71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October at 82.75 a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .60 cent higher with October at 46.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .47 cent to .58 cent lower with February at 46.57 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock climbed in heavy trading Monday after a published report said a major stockholder, <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, was buying more shares and looking into other options aimed at raising the company's stock price. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money manager whose firm owns 8.3 percent of the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, has hired Wall Street investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to explore ways to raise the price of the stock, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> reported Monday. The newspaper said <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> apparently thinks the stock is undervalued. Two calls to <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> Partners were not returned Monday. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was the most active issue traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, rising $ 3.62 -LCB- a share to $ 52.25 on volume of 1.65 million shares. After the stock market closed, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said a softening of revenue and increased expenses will cause significantly lower operating results for the company in both the third and fourth quarters. Expenses are higher than expected because of labor costs and onetime costs related to its recent merger with <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON> said. In addition, he said Hurricane Hugo disrupted the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> system in the Southeast. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the news story about <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is a speculative kind of thing,'' she said. Increasing services to overseas markets, selling off a stake in the business to a foreign investor or a recapitalization plan involving large stockholder dividends are among the options <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> is studying, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper also said that although there were no takeover plans, <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> had not ruled out a takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has already girded for possible takeover battles. In August, in what was described as a friendly deal, the company sold $ 358 million worth of a new preferred stock to <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION>, a firm led by billionaire investor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>. That stock could be converted to at least a 12 percent stake in the company in two years, according to the deal. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has also set up an employee stock plan and has boosted its stock buyback program. Under the buyback program the company hopes to have about 20 percent of its stock in friendly hands by mid-1990.

<HEAD>Dow Jones' Profit Down 9.9 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dow Jones & amp; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported a 9.9 percent decline in third-quarter profit, reflecting continued weakness in financial advertising in its publications and a drop in net income at a key affiliate The business publishing company said its profit fell to $ 28.8 million, or 29 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $ 32 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The decline occurred despite a 5.3 percent increase in revenue to $ 404.1 million from $ 383.7 million in the third quarter of 1988. Dow Jones attributed the profit decline partly to continued weakness in advertising at its flagship publication The Wall Street Journal and its weekly financial newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Barron </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the company said, its bottom line was hurt by a 17.6 percent drop in net income at <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronic financial data service that is 67 percent owned by <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Profits at <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> a publicly traded company, tumbled to $ 19.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $ 23.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1988. Most of the loss came from startup costs for its new foreign-exchange trading service. Separately Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> said it is in negotiations to buy the 50 percent stake that its partner <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns in the joint venture <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transactions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Telerate and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T began the venture in 1987 to develop an electronic service for foreign-exchange transactions Telerate is expected to reply on Tuesday to an $ 18-a-share, or $ 576 million, offer from Dow Jones for the remainder of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> that it does n't already own. The offer, announced last month, values the entire company at nearly $ 1.71 billion. Dow Jones' net income for the first nine months of the year jumped 49.7 percent to $ 277.2 million, or $ 2.75 a share, from $ 185.1 million, or $ 1.92 a share, in the year-earlier period. The latest nine-month period included an after-tax gain of $ 164.1 million, or $ 1.63 a share, from the sale in January of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>' interest in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> In the first nine months of 1988, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had an after-tax gain of $ 68 million, or 71 cents a share, mainly from the sale of its book-publishing subsidiary. Revenue for the first three quarters rose 4.9 percent to $ 1.25 billion from $ 1.19 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
 A state judge has refused to block a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed it was immune from the suit under national security laws. <ORGANIZATION> Stamford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> said in his decision, which was filed Friday and released Monday, that only the federal government _ not a private party _ could invoke national security privileges to protect itself from lawsuits. <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sued <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> in April after <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> was dropped from a top-secret program to develop a new generation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, is the prime contractor for the $ 4 billion <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> program. It had awarded a $ 114 million subcontract to <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION> in January 1988 to develop an in-air radar system for the jet fighter. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> said it canceled the contract because it was dissatisfied with <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s work. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, claims it is owed at least $ 39 million for the work it did on the radar system. It also claims its reputation was damaged by the cancellation and that hundreds of jobs also were eliminated as a result. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is seeking damages in excess of $ 15,000 in its lawsuit. Under <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law, plaintiffs can only specify ranges of damages they are seeking, not a specific amount. General Dynamics argued in court last month that it ca n't be sued because the contract dispute involves a top-secret project. Company attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said that to defend itself <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would have to publicly release top-secret documents. <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> said the release of such documents would compromise national security. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> contends it can prove its case without using top-secret documents. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' also argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lacks jurisdiction over the matter. <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> also rejected that claim, saying: `` This court does have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the instant case which is a contract action.'' <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> was n't in his office Monday and could n't be reached for a comment, according to a secretary. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinckerhoff </PERSON> said, `` We're pleased that this obstacle has been removed and the case can go forward.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not intervened in the dispute. It has asked only that national secrets not be disclosed.

 Stock prices kept their recent run of record highs going Monday with a small advance in slow holiday trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.89 to 2,791.41, hitting a new closing high for the fifth consecutive session. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 705 up, 657 down and 546 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 86.81 million shares, down from 172.52 million Friday and the lightest total since a 68.87 million-share day on July 3, which was a session sandwiched between a weekend and Independence Day. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 106.27 million shares. A quiet day had been expected in the absence of many market participants for the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays. Analysts said those traders who were on hand were apparently taking a moment to pause and reappraise the outlook for the economy and interest rates.

 <ORGANIZATION> Soichiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, the founder of the Japanese automaker that bears his name, dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and recalled the day he first saw an automobile _ a Model T he chased down a Japanese road when he was 6. `` Every time that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> car stopped, it left a little bit of an oil slick underneath and I smelled that oil slick, I enjoyed it thoroughly and I still remember very vividly the kind of enjoyment I had by smelling that oil slick,'' the 82-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition to the museum visit, where he received a plaque, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> was in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area to be inducted Tuesday into the Automotive Hall of Fame. He talked to reporters in front of a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Accord with a serial number 001, the first car to be made at the company's <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, assembly plant His company was followed by other Japanese automakers in establishing assembly plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> each have wholly owned plants on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is linked with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a joint venture and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> own a plant to make Subaru cars and Isuzu trucks. Later this year, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> begins production at its second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant, in East Liberty, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> will make Civic and Accord cars at the two plants. But <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has steered clear of linking itself with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker. It has a production agreement with the British automaker <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Sterling cars for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The company's founder declined to speculate on whether the company would join forces with any other company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` That never happened during my generation and I can not answer what is going to happen in the future,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> began his auto career in a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> repair shop at the age of 16. In the 1930s he became involved in racing and in 1937, he formed a small piston ring company. He formed <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1948 and began producing bicycles. The company entered the auto industry in 1963 and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer just less than 20 years later. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has no formal role with the company he founded. `` I retired from <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> 16 years ago. I'm currently unemployed.'' Yet his passion for cars and the way they work continues. `` What I would really like to do even today is mess up my hands and work in grease,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will record a $ 57 million after-tax charge in the third quarter, resulting in a loss for the quarter, the transportation and aircraft services company said Monday. The charge includes an adjustment for higher-than-expected workers' compensation loss reserves, staff and facility reduction costs, and a loss caused by the the bankruptcy filing of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which had an aircraft maintenance contract with <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. Also included in the charge are a write-down of the carrying value of unprofitable small businesses in Ryder's <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Services division, anticipated losses from the disposal of surplus vehicles in that division, and a slow-moving parts inventory in Ryder's aviation services operation. `` We are still dealing with the problems of margin and cost pressures in the <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Services Division and lower auto production affecting the Automotive Carrier Division,'' said Ryder's chairman, president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Ryder is expected to report the quarterly loss and revenue figures shortly. For 1988's third quarter, Ryder earned $ 55.2 million on revenue of $ 1.26 billion.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will close its Australian interbank foreign exchange, financial futures and stock brokerage activities. The New York-based investment house said the restructuring is part of a shakeout among Australian stock brokerages and foreign-exchange institutions, which are `` suffering from continuing increased competition and shrinking profit margins.'' An increase in the number of foreign commercial banks, investment banks and brokerages here has exacerbated the competition for business in the financial industry. `` It was decided we would be far better to focus our resources in the areas in which we can provide the most added value to clients from a local base and to move out of the <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> interbank foreign exchange market and Australian-sourced broking areas,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s Australian operations, said in a statement Monday. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the refocusing follows a review of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide operations `` We will service the foreign exchange, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equity and financial futures requirements of our institutional clients from our major locations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- That -RRB- appears to be the most appropriate course of action given the preference of larger institutions to look for advice directly from the offshore capital markets.'' The company said about 20 sales and trading employees will be offered a severance package or relocation. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, which is majority owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, started business in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1987.
