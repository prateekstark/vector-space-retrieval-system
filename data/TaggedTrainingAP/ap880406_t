 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is being courted by candidates and pursued by the press as curiosity mounts over whether he will endorse anyone before his state's important April 19 presidential primary. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s closest advisers insisted Wednesday that they did n't know when or even whether the inscrutable governor would give his blessing to one of the Democrats competing for the party's `` They've made it clear both publicly and privately they want his endorsement,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said of the candidates. `` But at this point nothing has changed, despite the 4,000 phone calls we got.'' `` He gets a constant stream of calls from the various candidates,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> political adviser <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Frucher </PERSON>. `` Obviously, the front-runners have always wanted him to endorse and the others try to keep him from endorsing.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said in an interview published in Thursday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he has not ruled out endorsing someone, but added, `` The closer you get to primary day, the less reason'' there is to do so. The newspaper quoted the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor as saying he preferred to remain neutral until after the final primaries and then back the leader. `` That's the time for leadership in this process,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, fresh from twin victories this week in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, is seeking to solidify his front-runner status _ and clear his path to the nomination _ with another win over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, for his part, is making a major effort in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to succeed outside his native South. He has not won a contest in a month and is no longer eligible for federal matching funds. There are two reasons candidates are eager for <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s endorsement First, the governor supported <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the 1984 election and, with the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> team running his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> scored a major victory. Second, and perhaps even more important to this year's candidates, a <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorsement would reduce speculation that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor is angling for the nomination himself from a deadlocked national convention and that he might be an available alternative for Democrats <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> set off a new round of speculation Tuesday when, asked about a possible <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorsement, he chuckled and told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that he planned to `` talk to you tomorrow.'' But on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had nothing new to report. `` I'd like to have it -LRB- <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s endorsement -RRB-. He knows that. But it's his decision to make,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is getting to be kind of fun,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said of the interest over what <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> will do. `` Yesterday, we were inundated with a wave of early morning ` he's going to go with the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>' calls, all out of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Then, a little bit later in the day, there was a wave of ` he's going with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>' calls out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aides and advisers said the candidates were treating <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> carefully, perhaps even warily, in seeking his backing. `` They're not pressuring the governor in any sense of the word,'' insisted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, the governor's son and chief political adviser. `` This is one guy that is not susceptible to pressure,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> added. `` If anything, pressure with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is counterproductive.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the candidates are all expected to appear separately Thursday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> meeting of about 300 members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The candidates will be making individual pitches to the Democratic officials, and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> could use the opportunity to make a dramatic endorsement. While the governor's political advisers said they doubted that would happen, they said they did expect him to again stress that he does not intend to become a candidate and that there should not be a convention draft. Thus far, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has refused to completely rule out accepting a convention draft, although he's said it wo n't happen and should n't happen He has maintained that should be enough of a disclaimer to satisfy everyone. `` He'll reinforce that people should not wait for him to endorse,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of his father's expected advice to fellow <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrats. `` He'll say again what he's said before: ` I'm not interested in running myself.'''

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>' 60th awards might well be termed the Year of the Actress, so impressive are the candidates for best performance by an actress in 1987. After being overshadowed for a few decades by macho stars, film actresses are now having powerful roles fashioned for them. This year's nominees afford proof: <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, the perplexed widow of `` Moonstruck''; <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, the vengeful spurned lover in `` Fatal Attraction''; <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the dynamic news producer of `` Broadcast News''; <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, the faded Czech actress, `` Anna''; and Meryl Streep, the down-and-out ex-singer in `` Ironweed.'' Adding to their impressive number are performances that many felt warranted Academy consideration: <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, `` The Whales of August''; <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, `` Hope and Glory''; <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, `` The Lonely Passion of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>''; <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahti </PERSON>, `` Housekeeping''; <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, `` Barfly''; Barbra Streisand, `` Nuts''; <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, `` The Glass Menagerie.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> has been drawing the most attention among the nominees, attracting a media broadside of amazing proportions. The one-time member of the <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> singing team is justifiably proud of her performance in `` Moonstruck'' and has been willing to talk about it. `` ` Moonstruck' is the first movie of mine that I ever watched without wanting to throw up,'' she says. `` I was in love with the story; it's my best work since ` Mask.' `` Usually everyone's first choice is Meryl -LRB- Streep -RRB- and then so-and-so and then so-and-so. It's something to start being someone's first choice. ... <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> has clout, you know. Barbra Streisand has clout. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> has clout. I think relative to them, I'm a newcomer. ... I'm not working my way toward power. I'm working my way toward the best roles I can get.'' Equally voluble is <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who won the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> as best dramatic actress for `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' She has been enjoying her success after years of trying: `` I have tested for the leading role in 25 movies, and each time the choice has narrowed to another actress and myself. Each time the other actress won.'' The actress campaigned for the role in the low-budget film, studying the Czech accent and absorbing the atmosphere of the emigre community in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She even added 15 pounds and taped her face to create wrinkles. Does she want the Oscar? `` I can not tell a lie; my fantasy ever since I was 5 years old has been to hold that -LRB- statue -RRB- and say, ` Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you.''' <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, hailed as a bright new star because of `` Broadcast News,'' has been as silent as <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> have been vocal. She declined most interviews, arguing that she was too involved with the <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> play, `` A Lie of the Mind,'' at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Mark Taper Theater Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> predicts the Georgia-born actress `` will be around for decades.'' Of his script she commented: `` I loved it; I thought it was remarkably three-dimensional.'' She also talked about the differences between herself and the news producer she portrays: `` <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> is certainly less driven than <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. I think that my priorities are quite a bit different, in that I'm probably retty obsessed myself, but not to such a manic degree.'' After three supporting-actress nominations in six film roles, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> broke through in the starring category with `` Fatal Attraction.'' She terms the demonic <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> the first woman she's played `` who is out of control, who emotionally runs the gamut _ the first real, full-blooded role I've had. Her comment on the huge reaction to `` Fatal Attraction'': `` The whole male-female thing in this country is very volatile right now. I think many women are feeling used by men. They invest a lot in a relationship, in nurturing a man emotionally and in his career, but they have their own careers and emotions, and they do n't get that nurturing in return.'' After playing a number of glamorous roles, two-time Oscar winner <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> found her role as the derelict in `` Ironweed'' had its advantages: `` In this world of purgatory of the soul, there are very few markers to go by. I liked that about her. I liked not having to worry about how I looked and being able to strip away, strip away everying, except what counts.'' Streep has created a series of indelible performances, including Oscar winners in `` <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>'s Choice,'' as well as `` The Deer Hunter'' and `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' She remains ambitious: `` There's so much I'd like to do. When the public is used to you in heavy drama, it's hard to make them take you seriously. But I want to play comedy. `` I ca n't stand it that stage fright inhibits me. At some point I'm going to face up and do a play. But for now I just go day to day.''

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> called himself and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` the <LOCATION> Springsteen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of the Geritol set'' Wednesday night as they launched into a `` Guys and Dolls'' medley, the encore in their Rat Pack show. Radio City Music Hall was n't exactly rocking, but it was swinging. The 6,000-seat hall was sold out, with a top ticket price of $ 75. `` Let's not overdo it,'' <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> cautioned as <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, making use of a new hip replacement, did a few dance steps during the encore, `` because I'm tired of working alone.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had embarked with his old <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> buddies on the so-called Rat Pack tour earlier this year but has been sidelined in recent weeks by kidney problems. `` We check with him every day,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> assured the crowd. `` He is cooking; he'll be back to work soon.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, as thin as <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> used to be, did the first 40 minutes of the two-hour show. He really sang jazz, and sometimes seemed to be trying to pull the 37-piece band's ponderous arrangements up to his swinging tempo. He had listeners' fingers snapping to `` Satin Doll,'' inserted little jokes into the lyrics of `` The Lady Is a Tramp,'' put powerful emotion into `` What Kind of Fool Am I?'' and `` Birth of the Blues'' and made `` Mr. <PERSON> Bojangles </PERSON>'' into a one-act play. He was never slick. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s voice sometimes has a frayed edge but his masterful phrasing and timing of pithy asides are intact. More important, his vocal timbre _ the thing that makes one know it's <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Damone </PERSON> or somebody else _ is still there. He sang the `` Soliloquy'' from `` Carousel'' and the audience exploded in applause. In it, he did some of his best singing of the evening. The audience also seemed to appreciate his ambition in choosing this high-quality, lengthy musical passage. Even better moments were <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s hard-swinging `` Mack the Knife'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' and the all-time saloon song, `` One More for the Road,'' which he has sung many times but this time also acted. When <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> harmonized beautifully on the final lines of `` The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' you knew you'd been thoroughly entertained. On their final night in town, Sunday, the Geritol boys will be joined by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in a benefit for cancer research.

 Daily doses of the drug Ritalin are increasingly the treatment of choice for children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Not surprisingly, more and more clinics are specializing in such diagnosis and treatment. And schools are often enthusiastic about Ritalin's success. Two stories offer inside looks at one such clinic, where an 11-year-old girl learned she would begin what might be years of Ritalin therapy, and at a school where teachers credit Ritalin with helping children conquer their emotional and academic despair. A third story looks at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the state with the youngest population, a reputation for moral conservatism _ and the highest per capita use of Ritalin in the nation.

 Her school principal had urged her mother to make the four-hour drive from rural northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Now 11-year-old <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> sat in a tiny, windowless office where a psychologist peppered her with questions. The morning would end with doctors at the Attention Deficit Disorder Clinic of Children's Hospital telling <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> her baffling problems at home and in school would mean treatment with the stimulant Ritalin, quite likely for years. But first doctors tested Chrissie: spelling tests, math tests, reading tests, questions about her family life. They probed her moods, whether she ever felt like committing suicide -LRB- `` once or twice,'' she said. -RRB- They examined her school grades, read reports from teachers. They even had <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, a sliver-thin, pretty girl with straight blond hair, draw a picture of herself. The 2-inch-high sketch spoke volumes to the psychologist about the youngster's poor self-image. Finally the psychologist asked <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> for three wishes. `` A horse ranch,'' the girl said after several moments. `` A happy life. And people who care who can help me through this tough time. `` I have n't really been happy since I was 2 or so. I yell at my parents. Later I wish I had n't done it. They're very good to me. So I have n't had a very happy life.'' <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, which is not the girl's real name, indeed had many problems, the doctors concluded. But she hardly fit the popular, often mistaken, stereotype of children who take Ritalin. First, boys are eight times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as having ADD. Second, <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> was n't `` bouncing off the walls.'' In fact, many youngsters recommended for Ritalin treatment are not discipline problems and appear calm in most situations. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, said psychologist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, is `` a classic case of a kid whose ADD was not caught as a young kid.'' Pre-adolescents and teen-agers who unexplainedly struggle with school for years often arrive at ADD clinics deeply depressed as a result of their attention problems. The key was her inability to complete tasks and concentrate. Tests suggested she was weak in math, easily frustrated, dangerously depressed, and had a poor self-image. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> knows she has troubles. `` I have quite a problem paying attention in school. I've had it since kindergarten,'' she told a visitor in a brief break from testing. `` I sometimes just have to get out of my seat. I go to the drinking fountain, and I'm not even thirsty. It's weird. `` If I have a problem, I'd really like to know about it.'' Fewer than 100 such ADD clinics operate around the country, according to <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a psychologist who heads one at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Nearly all start with the assumption that ADD is essentially a physiological disease that in most cases can be treated chemically Some clinics simply juggle prescriptions, using placebos and Ritalin or other stimulant drugs alternately to find the most effective treatment. They leave the followup and monitoring to others, often the family pediatrician. Others, like the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> clinic, employ pediatricians, psychologists and social workers to look at the child in totality. That means that counseling and changes in lessons or surroundings are often part of the treatment. But at the heart of these clinics is the conviction that Ritalin therapy helps most patients. Since it opened in September 1986, the ADD Clinic here has examined some 600 patients and has a three-month waiting list, said Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, a pediatrician and co-director of the clinic. At least three-quarters were diagnosed as having ADD, and about 85 percent of those were placed on medication, usually Ritalin. Once treatment begins, doctors rely on teacher questionnaires, report cards and parents to monitor whether Ritalin is helping the child in school and whether it is having side effects. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>'s teacher wrote this description of her on a Conners Questionnaire, the standardized form used to evaluate children suspected of having attention deficit disorder: `` <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> is not a behavior problem,'' her teacher wrote. `` I just do not have her attention 90 percent of the time. ... On the day we had our first bit of snow last fall, I was trying to help her understand something. She looked at me and smiled, saying ` I wonder what my kitten thinks of snow? She never saw it before.' Sometimes it seems her mind is way off somewhere else.'' <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> and her mother sat expressionless as the doctors later told them that Ritalin and psychological counseling `` should make a difference.'' Her mother expressed mild surprise over the prescription. `` Ritalin has a bad name,'' she said after the doctors had left the room. `` I was somewhat surprised because I associated Ritalin with hyperactivity.'' How is <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> doing? After six weeks of Ritalin and counseling, <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>'s teachers told doctors she had shown mild improvement in attention span and a marked improvement in her ability to sit still and stick to school work. Even with an increase in dosage, to 30 milligrams a day, she has exhibited no side effects. Progress, but no quick miracles, then, for <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>. The Ritalin therapy continues.

<TEXT>
 One of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>'s pupils takes the drug Ritalin to calm his hyperactivity and help him pay attention. She challenged a visitor to guess who. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> was the obvious choice. Seated with three other boys at a semicircular desk in a special education class at <ORGANIZATION> Scotch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the third-grader fidgeted in his chair, got up several times to sharpen his pencil, drummed his fingers, asked questions repeatedly and never seemed to hear the answers. The guess was wrong. Instead, the child on Ritalin was a slender boy with flaming red hair who calmly sailed through a reading comprehension quiz and listened attentively to a lesson on homonyms. <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> says he's doing so well he probably will leave handicapped classes forever in the fall. At Scotch Elementary, they believe in <LOCATION> Ritalin </LOCATION> _ and teachers point to cases like these to vindicate their faith in the controversial drug. Far from thinking Ritalin creates passive `` zombies,'' as some critics have charged, teachers and parents alike in this affluent northwest <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb seem convinced of Ritalin's track record for turning emotional and academic despair into success. Grades and attention span often improve, and some youngsters who might have spent entire school careers isolated in classes for the disabled have managed to rejoin their regular peers with the help of the drug. Most of all, teachers like <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> resent the assertion by some that Ritalin is merely a cynical way for schools to silence problem children while claiming they are trying to help them. `` I read that this is the way we treat kids we ca n't handle. It's not true. It's just not true,'' said <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, whose daughter has taken the drug for four years. While an estimated 1-2 percent of the nation's 40 million schoolchildren take Ritalin, Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wender </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> psychiatrist and author of several books on attention deficit disorder, or ADD, believes 3-to-10 percent of all children have hyperactivity problems. At Scotch Elementary, approximately 5 percent of the 550 pupils drop by principal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>'s office each day to take a pill. Several elements help explain why Ritalin is commonplace at Scotch Elementary; teachers and school administrators have attended seminars and taken other training to recognize symptoms of ADD. Area doctors are not only willing to prescribe Ritalin but also to work with teachers and schools to monitor its success. And parents generally seem to accept the professionalism, good faith and judgment of the teachers and doctors. `` When you first start talking to parents about this, they're devastated,'' said principal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> `` Then 90 percent react that it is a medical problem.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> tells of a youngster named <PERSON> George </PERSON> who has taken Ritalin for two years. He had been assigned to a `` resource room,'' where handicapped children get individual instruction for part of each day. `` He had an incident every day of losing his temper, punching someone or screaming in vile terms,'' said <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>. `` Now he's out of special education He's a winner.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, like other educators, insists `` we never recommend medication.'' But that's only partly true. If the school's psychologist, social worker or reading specialist believes a child has ADD, they know which doctors will nearly always prescribe Ritalin At the top of the list is Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, a pediatrician who operates the <ORGANIZATION> Attention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deficit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Schools from all over <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> recommend her, and prospective patients often wait 6-8 weeks for an appointment She now treats 1,500 youngsters for ADD, some as young as 3. Almost invariably, she prescribes Ritalin or similar medication. `` I work magic with the medicine,'' she said in an interview in her office. `` I'm willing to try things. `` We're talking about large numbers of kids who are getting a bum steer in life, from kindergarten on. Some look like couch potatoes. They do n't all look alike,'' she said. But even Ritalin's advocates admit it is n't always well-monitored. Teachers are supposed to provide crucial information enabling doctors to set the right dosage, or to determine if drugs are necessary at all to academic success. Such monitoring is frequent when medication first begins. After that, `` there really is n't that much to do unless there's a problem,'' the doctor said. <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and other ADD specialists typically send teachers questionnaires to fill out for the first 2-4 weeks of medication, then gradually less frequently until `` we feel we're on a steady course. At a certain point we step out of the picture unless the teacher notices a problem.'' Still, Ritalin remains a `` last resort,'' said <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>. Teachers might, for example, put distractible children in study carrels _ desks with three sides blocked off so the child ca n't see in front or to either side. But when `` we've exhausted all those things ... logged the classroom observations,'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said, `` we would just as soon get a recommendation to try something else.''

 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is a state of large, close-knit families whose religion frowns on the use of liquor and caffeine. It is also a state with the nation's largest appetite for the stimulant drug Ritalin. The <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said that in 1986 pharmacies along the state's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> received 25,000 grams of the drug used for hyperactive children, or 1,558 grams for every 100,000 population. That figure compares to 1,218 grams per 100,000 residents of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the next highest Ritalin state. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the figure was 347 grams per 100,000. The reasons for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s high use of Ritalin are many. They may point the way for the future in other parts of the country. `` What we are doing here is, in some ways, ahead of many parts of the country,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wender </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has the youngest population of any state, with nearly a quarter of its residents aged 5 to 17. It also leads the nation in the size of individual families, about 4.3 children per household. Consequently it has the nation's most crowded classrooms with 24.6 students per teacher. Although <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> ranks near the top of the list in the amount of state money, 47 percent, going to education, it is last in per capita spending on education, at $ 2,372 per student. So when the fragile balance in these overcrowded classrooms is threatened by disruptive children, `` the pressures on parents and teachers are going to lead people to look for solutions ... and one of the solutions is medication,'' said <PERSON> Stevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukic </PERSON>, state director of special education. In the <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, an estimated 2 percent of the 60,000 students receive Ritalin or one of its cousins for attention deficit disorder, a syndrome that includes hyperactive as well as inattentive pupils. `` It is becoming more acceptable in the parents' minds and the teachers' minds,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a special education teacher whose son takes Ritalin. `` When the teachers see the dramatic effect it can have on problem students, they want them medicated so they can learn.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a psychologist who saw 100 ADD children at his clinic last year, estimates a quarter of his patients are referred by the schools. Another 25 percent come at the suggestion of other parents whose children take Ritalin. Half his patients were sent by pediatricans. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s medical community also contributes to Ritalin use. Reseachers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> are considered leaders in ADD study. Their philosophies are passed on to their students, many of whom later set up practice nearby. As a result, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> has three clinics that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of ADD children _ many larger cities across the country have none. Psychologists, psychiatrists and pediatricians share information and refer patients for treatment. `` In a community this size it is easier to make an impact with an idea, especially an idea that appeals to people,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. Parents of ADD children describe their successes with Ritalin as more than appealing. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> cries when she talks about the effect Ritalin has had on her 11-year-old son, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>. `` There has been such a remarkable change in this child,'' she said. `` From the time he was 7 he talked about suicide. Now he's on the student council and is so thrilled with life.'' Mrs. Miner has joined others in a local support group for ADD parents. The gatherings can be emotional: laughter about the bruises and stitches their children have collected while rocketing around the house, tears as they talk about the difference treatment has brought. `` I wanted to share the knowledge with other families,'' said the group's founder, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Steineckert </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 11, has taken Ritalin for more than a year. `` It is very traumatic to put a child on drugs, but if you have a good experience, you're converted,'' she said

 Three months ago, Mayor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> stopped attending council meetings, changed her phone number and refused to explain why she had forsaken her duties. For the last half-century, Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> had helped run the city as city clerk, treasurer and finally as mayor in a homespun way that endeared her to the townsfolk. But she has announced she will resign April 12, just 19 days short of her 51st anniversary in city government. Council President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said Monday he received Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s one-sentence resignation letter. `` I've been kind of expecting it,'' he said. Although Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, 77, has said her doctor has told her to `` take it easy,'' the letter does n't indicate why she is leaving. <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, the acting mayor, said, `` We know as much now as we did.'' He said the council could choose a successor from a list of three candidates to be submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Hunterdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but he is inclined to leave the seat vacant until the November elections. `` We seem to be doing fine,'' he said. `` I'm certainly happy to fill the void.'' With 3,900 residents, <LOCATION> Lambertville </LOCATION> does n't need a lot of governing. The old mill and ferry town, which spreads along the east bank of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, comes to life in the summer when visitors from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> browse its art galleries, antique shops, quaint cafes, bookstores and magnificent Victorian homes. An 85-year-old, two-lane iron bridge carries cars and pedestrian across the wide, lazy river to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s ties to the town go back several generations She was elected in 1982 and re-elected in 1985, but stopped attending meetings in January, and shows up for work infrequently. She spoke briefly with a reporter one day last month while walking down <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> in town. Asked about her absence, Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> replied: `` Medical problems. Just say I ca n't work because of medical problems.'' `` My doctor says I have to take it easy. Now I do n't want to talk about it anymore.'' With that closing line, she walked briskly across the street and into a five-and-dime. So, townspeople can only speculate about what happened. Some thought it was a political rift over whether to rehire police Chief <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Venettone </PERSON>, who suffered a heart attack last year. The council in January overruled Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> and allowed him to return. Others thought it had roots in the city's fiscal mess. In a 1987 audit, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the mayor had taken it upon herself to maintain financial records and payroll documents which the treasurer was required to handle. According to the audit, the minutes of the monthly council meetings were not properly recorded. Vouchers lacked proper signatures and invoices. The treasurer signed blank checks in advance, which is prohibited by the state. `` There was nothing criminal, but there were certain things being done up there that were n't according to <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpster </PERSON>. `` It was a mom-and-pop operation.'' Since that time, the Council has asserted its independence and some say Ms. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> has not taken that well. But no one really knows for sure. What is certain, however, is the lifelong residents hold her in high regard. `` I like her very much,'' said <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, 83. `` I always thought she was very nice. She's always good with people of limited incomes.'' `` She's a woman who's cared for the city tremendously,'' added businessman <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>.

 The fugitive leader of a coup attempt last year claims President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is incapable of ensuring the suvival of the nation and he withdrew a pledge to avoid hostile acts against her government. A statement carrying the signature of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, 39, was made available to news organizations Wednesday by sources close to the renegade officer. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> last Saturday. Chief military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said a nationwide search has turned up no trace of him. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led an attempted coup on Aug. 28 in which at least 53 people were killed. Among the hundreds wounded was Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s only son, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> noted in the statement that his faction promised last November to refrain from hostile acts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to give her time to fulfill promises to improve the government. `` We are now withdrawing that declaration,'' the statement said. `` It has become obvious by its own actions, that the Aquino administration is incapable of ensuring the very survival of this nation over the next few years. We have to act and act boldly.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who was arrested Dec. 9, said he and others jailed in previous coup attempts had been detained for months without formal charges or trial. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, military uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> after thousands of civilians joined the revolt.

<HEAD>Mexico Using Novel Approach To Combat AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Alarmed by the fast spread of AIDS in the country, <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities have begun a campaign called <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, a novel approach that enlists those most likely to be afflicted to spread the word. The campaign is aimed directly at male and female prostitutes, the homosexual community, street gangs and the poor in the hope that what they learn about AIDS prevention will `` cascade'' down to others in their own vernacular. Most of the effort is concentrated in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a metropolis of 18 million people, where high-risk people are hard to reach through newspapers and other standard means. `` We are teaching them to become health care promoters and sending them into their communities,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Glorias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that using the media to give information is not enough to change behavior patterns. Only face-to-face contact can do that,'' she said. `` The best way is for them to reach their own communities in their own language. That includes prostitutes reaching out to prostitutes, homosexuals to homosexuals, even deaf-mutes to deaf-mutes.'' According to the center, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had 1,126 confirmed AIDS cases as of Feb. 1, and the number is doubling every seven months. For every confirmed case, an additional 50 to 100 people are becoming exposed to the virus, said Dr. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> <PERSON> Amor </PERSON>, the department's director of epidemiology. <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON>, who is also president of the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS Prevention, estimated during a recent interview the number of people confirmed to have AIDS will reach over 25,000 by 1991, making it the second or third leading cause of death for people in the 25 to 44 age group in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which has a population estimated at 81.7 million. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the number of AIDs cases reported since June, 1981, has reached 57,024. Since it was founded last year, the information center has broadcast its services on radio and television and through bumper stickers, posters, keychains and matchbooks with condoms attached. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> recently received a donation of 10 million condoms from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The center also has trained dozens of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residents in its Cascade Education program, offering instructional rclasses but leaving the actual teaching process to each individual. `` We give them the basics, then leave the style of presentation in their own hands,'' <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said. The center's staff also trains street-gang leaders and visits jails to teach police officials and prisoners. <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said many of the Cascade volunteers from the streets originally visited the center to be tested for the AIDS virus and, with counselling and support, have joined the program. She said the best of them are those who have tested positive. One male prostitute in the program, only known by his nickname of <LOCATION> Jaimito </LOCATION>, regularly visits <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> markets to sing a `` ranchero'' song he wrote and recorded called, `` What is AIDS?'' <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> called <PERSON> Jaimito </PERSON> `` one of our great promoters.'' A deaf mute who also is a male prostitute is another is Cascade promoter. `` He uncovered a whole sub-culture of deaf mutes who prostitute themselves off to make a living,'' <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said. `` We found that many feel they have no other way to earn money.'' An initial <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey indicated that about 30 percent of the male homosexual community in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been exposed to the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurita </PERSON>, a Cascade volunteer leader, said cultural prejudices have made it very difficult for homosexual men to seek help. `` There's incredible discrimination against homosexuals, who are isolated from the centers of the country,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` Teaching them about AIDS is difficult. They are forced to hide from the police and other government authorities.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> brings youths from what he calls `` controlled groups'' of prostitutes to the center to be examined and learn about AIDS prevention. `` But there are others we ca n't get to, who are more preoccupied with making a living than with taking care of their lives,'' he said. <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> and other health officials say the Cascade approach is essential not only in reaching previously hidden subcultures but in confronting many myths about AIDS. `` We've come across many beliefs,'' <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said. `` Some say AIDS is punishment from God, and others, that witchcraft can ward it off. In a country with cultural setbacks that include religious beliefs, ignorance and cultural taboos that do not allow the use of condoms, we found that this program has worked.'' Currently, <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said the center is receiving 50 visits and 100 telephone queries a day from people wanting to find out about AIDS. `` It's new that they should come out at all,'' she said. `` The very lowest class is the most at risk, and the hardest to get to. There's a disrespect for life -LRB- among them -RRB-; they do n't care if they die.'' As in other countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the center had to overcome initial resistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in distributing literature and promoting the use of condoms. Clerics are one way of reaching rural areas, <PERSON> Ornellas </PERSON> said. `` We have n't even started with rural people, where you have whole families living in a single room. Children learn about sex in one room. What's going to happen when AIDS reaches these rural areas?''

 A web of unity has spread through the occupied lands in four months of violence, drawing Palestinian into committees for everything from tending emergency gardens to running the rebellion. `` I think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a long time,'' said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American who promotes creation of civic action groups. Boys and businessmen of this middle-class town turned the earth of a vacant lot this week and planted squash, tomatoes and cucumbers so their neighborhood will have fresh produce during curfews imposed by the Israeli army. Last month in <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> village, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter spoke with young Arabs who stood midnight watch to warn of approaching soldiers. Nurses who got through an army blockade of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION> refugee camp in February said health workers had formed a loose network that could rush aid to areas where where Palestinians clashed with soldiers. `` There are medical committees, agricultural committees, defense committees,'' said <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many of these committees work in the open,'' and more secret groups organize strikes, protests and political activities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON> said the young leaders of secret groups generally are affiliated with factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` They may be new faces, but they will be new faces of leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` These are leaders who have become leaders because they are doing something to attack the occupation.'' An underground network of PLO-affiliated leaders has shown its strength by demanding, and getting, mass resignations of Arab policemen in the occupied territories and nearly universal acceptance of commercial strikes. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempts to crush the leadership with mass arrests have not stopped the clandestine leaflets. Communique No. 11 told Arabs to boycott institutions linked to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and form `` popular committees in every place, in city, village, camp and street.'' Leaflets urge people to `` cultivate the land'' increase self-reliance, police themselves in the absence of Arab policemen and start local manufacturing operations to lessen dependence on the Israeli economy. <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehadeh </PERSON>, a Palestinian lawyer, said neighborhood groups had multiplied in tandem with economic and social hardships created by the conflict that began Dec. 8. `` I think it's happening a lot, especially for security and self-sufficiency,'' said <PERSON> Shehadeh </PERSON>, who leads a human rights group in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> called Law in the Service of Man. `` People are experiencing a siege.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, the Arab-American head of the Center for the Study of Non-Violence in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said groups of 10 to 20 families have formed throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, with the largest numbers in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> school, instead of having a playground for kids they cultivate ... beans, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes,'' he said. `` I think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a long time and the Israelis are going to push hard. ... The next step is to make the Palestinians feel hungry.'' Arab strikes and Israeli restrictions have complicated deliveries of fresh produce, but canned and packaged goods are in ample supply and there is no evidence of hunger. Many residents have stockpiled food. Others buy groceries from farmers or merchants' homes rather than shops. When fresh produce is available, Palestinians often can not buy it because of curfews. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, a businessman in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, said two dozen households in his neighborhood formed a committee at the end of March, when the army sealed off the occupied territories for three days. He said his four new hens had laid their first eggs. Less than a week later, he joined six men and eight children in cultivating a vacant lot. While they worked, army trucks rolled past shops that were closed for most of the previous week by a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ban on afternoon work and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to let them open in the morning. The businessman, who asked that his last name be withheld, said the committee also had decided to start first aid classes, form security patrols and build an emergency stock of food. `` We made a request to every house to buy a big bag of flour'' and arranged to buy food from store owners even when their shops are closed, he said. `` People are now thinking of collecting wood for baking,'' <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>'s wife said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> cut off supplies of fuel oil and gasoline two weeks ago. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON>, another committee member, said the grassroots groups would be harder for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to handle than labor unions, social associations and schools. `` There is no infrastructure the Israelis can control,'' he said. `` To put it down, they'll have to arrest everybody,'' and in that case `` you're not succeeding. You've lost control.''

 What's a birthday without a party? Or, in the case of this Southern Illinois city, what's a party without a birth date?

<HEAD>FCC Looking Into Practices of New Phone Operator Services</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is advising consumers to beware when using hotel, hospital and pay telephones to make operator-assisted calls. The agency has received 260 complaints since January from irate callers who were billed by a company they had never heard of, at rates that were several times the rates charged by the major long-distance companies. In one case, the charges were 10 times higher, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. The complaints have prompted the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to begin looking into the practices of alternative operator services, known as AOS companies, which have emerged to compete in a $ 7 billion-a-year market that until recently was served only by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We've never seen a situation quite like this addressed by the commission,'' describing the complex nature of the problem AOS companies pose, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone enforcement division. `` We do n't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill an industry,'' he said, adding that the commission needs more information before deciding whether federal action is warranted. AOS companies began forming within the past two years ago to fill the void left when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T stopped paying commissions to hotels and motels on the long-distance calls made by their guests. Atleast some of the AOS companies kick back money to the contracting hospital, hotel, motel or other business. The AOS companies, now estimated to number around 40, handle calls mainly made by the transient public in hotels, motels and at pay phones as well as hospitals and universities. They handle credit-card, collect and third-party billed calls. Typical complaints, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said, are that callers are given no indication that an AOS company is handling their calls or that they will be billed at higher rates than those of the company whose long-distance credit card they are using. AOS rates are not regulated by the FCC. The commission regulates the rates <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T can charge but not the rates of any other long-distance companies because none is large enough to control market prices. In complaints investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, the AOS companies have refunded the disputed amount, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said. At an establishment served by an AOS company, callers who dial `` 0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator gets billing information and then sends the call over a line the AOS leases from one of the long-distance carriers, like <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T or <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the callers who end up connected to an AOS company are those using a credit card issued by a local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone company or <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing a `` 0.'' Other companies' cards require callers to dial a local or 800 number to place their call. Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along with their monthly local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone bill. Some AOS companies also accept payment by other credit cards such as <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> and Visa. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> advises that callers ask an operator what company they work for, what rates they will be charged and how they will be billed before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, they should find another phone, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> says. Several states have begun considering regulation of AOS companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer alerts. AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which consumers have n't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companies say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers before placing their calls. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said, however, that some AOS companies can place automated calls, which substitute `` bong'' tones for a live operator to instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is no federal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, he said.

 The number of Americans caught in foreign drug busts jumped 22 percent last year, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported in an effort to scare <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists out of taking controlled substances on overseas vacations. `` As we approach the busy travel season, many Americans are getting ready for that long-awaited trip abroad; for some, the trip will become a nightmare,'' the department said Tuesday in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Police abroad seized 1,242 Americans on drug charges last year, compared with 1,013 in 1986, the report said. The biggest increases in drug-related arrests of Americans were in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, where governments are under pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to get tough on narcotics. Of the 3,041 Americans taken into custody in foreign countries, 41 percent were suspected of drug violations. `` Americans have been arrested for possessing as little as a third of an ounce of marijuana,'' the report said. It added: `` Those Americans who assume there is no real danger in buying or carrying just a ` small' amount of drugs on their overseas trip may be in for a very unpleasant surprise. `` Many travelers also assume that, as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, they are immune from prosecution under foreign laws.'' That was underscored Tuesday by a Spanish court's conviction of <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> photographer, on cocaine importation charges. Despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government belief that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was an innocent traveler duped by an acquaintance into carrying the drugs into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, he was sentenced to six years in jail. The 10 countries that arrested the most Americans on all charges last year were <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 990; <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, 346; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 267; the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, 196; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 128; <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 124; the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, 74; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 60; <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 53 and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, 52. At year's end, 596 Americans were serving jail sentences overseas. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have inmate transfer treaties that permit offenders to serve their sentences in jails in their homeland, but fewer prisoners than normal were able to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal prisons did n't have enough space Riots among Cubans at federal penitentiaries in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, aggravated the crowding. The largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from Americans abroad came from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, notably those in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> prison near <LOCATION> Hermosillo </LOCATION>. About one-fourth of the 164 Americans arrested in that area of northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> complained of mistreatment and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials found such reports credible and made a vigorous formal protest in August,'' the report said. Since then, no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been received, the report said. Several countries prevented <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to Americans with dual nationality. TheSoviet Union, as in the past, refused to grant access to three prisoners with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nationality and obstacles also were raised in cases in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, the report said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> also received complaints from American tourists detained at the border for alleged customs violations. Most of the Americans were fined in dollars _ scarce currency in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> _ and released within 24 hours. The number of Americans incarcerated in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> declined last year, mostly because that country relaxed punishments against foreigners accused of breaking the Islamic ban on alcoholic beverages. Instead of sentencing liquor possessors to jail, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> now usually deports them, the report said. Americans in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> benefited from a round of pardons granted on the 60th birthday of the king. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners were released and a few others had their sentences reduced. Still, 30 Americans remained in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s `` substandard'' prisons at the end of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 46,000 on medical assistance and food for needy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners, more than $ 20,000 of which went to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inmates in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, according to the report.

<HEAD>Lower Costs, Higher Prices Benefit Hog And Cattle Farmers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The long-awaited financial turnaround for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture has been led by a two-year economic boomlet in the livestock sector, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Since the fourth quarter of 1985, hog and cattle farmers have benefited from generally higher prices and lower feed costs,'' the report said. `` Feed expenses declined by $ 2.4 billion during 1985-87, while hog and cattle -LRB- sales -RRB- receipts increased by $ 4.7 billion.'' Further, poultry and egg sales increased $ 1.5 billion in 1986 before declining last year. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, the net cash income of farmers _ what's left over from gross cash income after deducting cash expenses _ rose to a record $ 57 billion in 1987 from $ 52 billion in 1986 and $ 47.3 billion in 1985. Some decline is expected this year to between $ 50 billion and $ 55 billion. The report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine and was written by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodl </PERSON>. `` More than 80 percent of the $ 10 billion increase in net cash income from 1985 to 1987 went to livestock producers,'' the report said. `` Strong growth in net cash income was shared by most major livestock enterprises in 1986, and by hog, dairy and beef farms in 1987.'' The darker side was among crop producers who saw feed grain receipts decline from their 1985 peak, contributing to the recent financial stress on <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> crop farms. `` However, the strong rebound in livestock earnings has provided an important offset in this region,'' the report said. `` Five of the top 10 cattle producing states and seven of the top 10 hog producing states are located in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION> -LRB- from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> -RRB- and western Corn Belt -LRB- <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' The gains in livestock receipts and big increases in government payments translated into increases of 70 percent to 80 percent in the net cash incomes of farmers in the two regions, the report said. `` Farmers used their higher incomes to pay down more than $ 6 billion of farm business and household debt annually during 1984-87,'' the report said. `` They are now in a position to reap substantial benefits in 1988 from continued livestock profits and from recovering crop profits.'' The overall debt crunch of the early and mid-1980s `` has subsided,'' the report said. `` By the end of this year business debt in agriculture likely will have fallen $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, or nearly one-third, since 1983.'' It added: `` Farmers' recent financial progress is evident in the closely watched debt-to-asset ratio, which measures the degree of lender security and the farmers' use of their earnings and capital to finance farming operations.'' After climbing to 23 percent in 1985 _ which meant farers owed $ 23 for every $ 100 worth of assets _ economists said the debt-to-asset ratio nationally declined to an estimated 17 percent to 19 percent by 1988.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been given approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to buy an additional 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has already bought more than 4.9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under previously announced authorizations under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The subsidies have ranged from less than $ 20 to more than $ 40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $ 1.09 per bushel.

 Public comments are being sought on how to define a `` person'' for purposes of determining federal limits on payments to farmers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. There are limits on federal payments to individuals, including benefits paid under commodity price support programs, the Conservation Reserve Program and some other programs where direct payments are made. Additionally, the proposed rule would determine whether foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments. In budget legislation late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> included a number of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> farm payment regulations, beginning with 1989 crops. The law provides, for example, that to qualify for payments a `` person'' must be actively engaged in farming by providing a significant amount of capital, equipment or land, and personal labor or management to the enterprise. A basic limit of $ 50,000 per person annually is set on direct `` deficiency'' payments, but this can be ballooned to as much as $ 100,000 maximum depending on a person's interest in other entities. The term `` person'' can include individuals, corporations, associations, charitable organizations or other entity as determined by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. A recent study by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the law requires the secretary of agriculture `` to give fair and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries thereof, and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and continue to be operated separately.'' Written comments can be sent by May 6 to: Director, Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, ASCS-USDA, P.O. Box 2415, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20013.

<HEAD>Wealthiest 1 Percent Pays 26 Percent of Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of high-income Americans has risen sharply during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and so has their share of the total federal tax burden. The 1 million or so couples and individuals whose incomes put them among the nation's wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers paid 26.1 percent of all personal income taxes collected in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. That share is up from 18.1 percent in 1981, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. In its study issued Tuesday, the department did not say what income level would place taxpayers into that highest 1 percent. But it issued a parallel set of statistics showing that during the same period, the share borne by those making over $ 100,000 rose from 15.2 percent of the total to 30.6 percent. Meanwhile, the portion of taxes paid by those with incomes under $ 50,000 _ the majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> _ dropped from 66.8 percent in 1981, before enactment of across-the-board tax cuts, to 45.7 percent in 1986, the department said. Those in between, making $ 50,000 to $ 100,000, paid the rest, with their share rising from 18 percent to 23.7 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> attributed part of the higher tax payments by the wealthy to `` the extraordinary level of capital gains realized in 1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate increase on capital gains.'' In 1986, the maximum tax rate on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock, real estate and other investments, was 20 percent. Knowing the rate would rise to 28 percent in 1987, investors sold billions of dollars worth of assets in the closing days of 1986, which boosted their total incomes for that year. That sell-off helped capital gains account for nearly 25 percent of the total income of the richest 1 percent of Americans in 1986. In 1985, capital gains accounted for 15 percent; in 1981, 11 percent. By contrast, capital gains make up on the average less than 2 percent of the income of the other 99 percent of Americans. The preliminary analysis is based on a sampling of tax returns filed last year, reflecting income earned in 1986. The study made no attempt to fully explain the growing share of taxes paid by the richest Americans. However, once its analysis is complete, the administration is likely to claim that the increase results from the big 1981 across-the-board tax cut that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s behest. That law slashed the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. It since has been cut to 33 percent. The administration reasons that reducing tax rates gives workers and investors incentive to produce and save more. Inflation and economic growth have helped boost incomes and, thus, increase the number of taxpayers who make more than $ 100,000 a year. In 1986, about 12 of every 1,000 couples and individuals topped that level. The analysis found those taxpayers paid $ 43 billion in taxes in 1981, $ 77 billion in 1985 and $ 115 billion in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says more than 1.2 million couples and individuals earned over $ 100,000 in 1985, an increase of 63 percent over 1982. The number earning over $ 1 million a year more than doubled from 1982 to 1985, to 17,312. Between 1981 and 1986, taxes paid by those with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 increased from $ 51 billion to $ 89 billion. The burden on those under $ 50,000 dropped from $ 190 billion to $ 172 billion. About half of Americans have incomes under $ 35,000 a year, including those who are too poor to pay taxes. They paid 7.5 percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 6.4 percent in 1986.

<HEAD>US Median Age Sets Record High</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are easing into their middle years, as growing numbers of maturing Baby Boomers boost the nation's median age to a record high of just over 32 years The 35-44 age group represents the leading edge of the post-World War II Baby Boom and is the fastest-growing segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. And the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84 rank second and third in growth since 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. This combination helped boost the nation's median age to 32.1 years as of last July 1, the highest ever. `` The ` Graying of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' is ... documented by its increasing age,'' observed bureau statistician <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Up from 31.8 in 1986, the median means that half of all Americans are older than that age and half younger. By race, blacks remain younger than whites, although both groups are maturing. For whites, the median age hit 33 for the first time, up from 32.7 in 1986. Black median age was 27.2, up from 26.9 and the first time that group had surpassed 27. The nation's median age first reached 30 in 1950, but the rapid growth of the Baby Boom that was then occurring pulled it back down in the following years. The Baby Boom consists of the estimated 20 million Americans born between 1946 and 1965. With the maturing of the Baby Boomers, the median has begun moving in the other direction. The growing elderly population has also helped raise the median, as improved medical care extends lifepsans. `` The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` They will continue to affect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for many years to come.'' They are now at the age where they have more discretionary income and the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and marketing, she said. The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby products. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system, following up with creation of a national orientation toward teen-age music and styles. Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households, they are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods, marketing experts say. `` Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement age, they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the country takes,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> added. Meanwhile, the Boomers are being followed by the much smaller Baby Bust generation, leaving fast-food outlets, retail stores and others offering `` first jobs'' searching for employees, she said. The Boomers boosted the 35-44 age group by 33.8 percent between 1980 and 1987 to some 34.4 million people, the bureau reported. The 25-34 age group remains the most numerous with 43.5 million members, but that is up only 16.8 percent from 1980, the study noted. When Americans now in that age group move on, they will have few replacements. Between 1980 and 1987 the 18-24 group declined by 9.7 percent to 27.3 million, and those aged 14-17 fell 11 percent to 14.4 million. Even the 5-13 group slipped 1.1 percent to 30.8 million, but those under 5 jumped 11.6 percent in the Baby Boom echo. They totaled 18.2 million. The second-fastest growing segment was aged 85 and over, increasing 28 percent to 2.2 million. The 75-84 group was third, jumping 20.3 percent to 7.7 million. Americans in the 65-74 group increased 13.4 percent to 17.7 million. Turning to the small groups born in the Depression and World War II: The 45 - to 54-year-old group increased only 2.1 percent to 23.3 million and those 55-64 were up 1.5 percent to 22.0 million

Executive producer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> unveiled a prototype of the syndicated, daily television show and his four-person anchor team Tuesday at one of a series of news conferences, this one in the Rainbow Room, upstairs from his old office at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> where he was executive producer of `` Today.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> _ The Television Show'' premieres on Sept. 12, but is already a hit, having been sold in 118 markets covering 85 percent of the country. That gives it, higher coverage than any syndicated show except `` Wheel of Fortune,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. The promotional reel <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> showed reporters promised stations considering buying the show that it would take them `` into the'90s.'' `` It's a fast-paced world and I think a lot of the media has n't caught up,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, after showing the tape The pace of the promotional show, complete with commercials, was fast to spin heads. Not surprisingly, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> assured reporters that `` USA Today'' wo n't be a `` traditional'' news show but rather will rely on upbeat human-interest stories, polls and interviews. Since it's based on the colorful, successful, young national newspaper, it `` does n't have any baggage from the past,'' he said. `` We do n't have to worry about what <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON> said.'' The show is the first product from <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, the partnership between former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON>, who is also former president of <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's largest newspaper group. GTG is also producing network entertainment shows. `` <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> _ The Television Show'' will be a half hour daily, an hour on weekends. The show will be fed to stations each day via satellite at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said 96 of the stations will broadcast the show in what he considers its ideal time period, the hour between the evening news and the beginning of prime time. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> has assembled a good-looking cast of network veterans to anchor the four segments, based on the four sections of the newspaper: <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> as `` Front Page'' anchor; <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, also formerly with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, as `` Money'' editor; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for `` Sports'' and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, also formerly with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, for `` Life.'' The show will preview the next day's edition of `` USA Today,'' but not necessarily have the same stories as the newspaper. `` It will be topical, but to be successful it will have to be different,'' said <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON>. `` We will be doing what would be the next day's lead the night before.'' <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON> suggested he might have coaches other than baseball managers wear uniforms for a segment. `` Or let's have the head of an airline dress like a pilot for a day to see how it fits, see how people react,'' he said. A daily poll will be the centerpiece of the show, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. The promotional tape featured a poll on marriage, using clips from movies to illustrate the results, for example, `` Body Heat'' illustrating a question about infidelity. Academy Award-winning composer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who wrote the theme, was featured in an interview in the promotional tape describing the music, much like the show, as having `` a happy, laid-back feeling, but with a sense of urgency.'' <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> is n't the only newspaper getting into the act. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>, which has a radio show, is holding a news conference later this week to announce its own television show.

 Hands shielding swollen eyes from the glare of television lights, the three little girls squirmed uncomfortably in the hospital room as they were displayed as survivors of a poison gas attack. The girls are among five victims being treated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for chemical burns to the lung, eyes and skin. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says they are survivors of a March 16 chemical attack by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on the Kurdish village of <LOCATION> Halabjah </LOCATION>. Four of them met reporters Tuesday in an event organized by the Iranian mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the arena for a bitter propaganda war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> enemies have been fighting for 7 -LCB- years. One patient, <PERSON> Nazanin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, 30, was not shown to reporters because she is in the intensive care unit. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government says <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> bombed its own citizens with chemical weapons _ killing 5,000 and injuring 7,000 _ after members of the restive Kurdish minority welcomed invading Iranian troops to <LOCATION> Halabjah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Azizi </PERSON>, a 25-year-old university student, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces attacked the village several times in response to Kurdish unrest. But <PERSON> Azizi </PERSON> said even from the shelter of his basement, he knew the March 16 attack was different. `` We smelled the gas,'' he explained through an intepreter. `` We knew it was not the other kind of bomb,'' the ordinary kind. <PERSON> Azizi </PERSON> said from his hospital bed that when he ventured outside hours later, he saw streets strewn with the victims of what doctors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspect was mustard gas, a World War I weapon outlawed worldwide since 1925. `` Any door you opened there were children, men and women, dying, dead,'' <PERSON> Azizi </PERSON> said, his words punctuated by rough coughs. `` I saw a lot of people in cars. As many as 10, 11, 12 in a car. They were dying.'' He said he and other stunned survivors began streaming out of <LOCATION> Halabjah </LOCATION>. `` We tried to run out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Azizi </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We did n't want to see that.'' But he said that once outside, he was soon sickened by the gas. `` My eyes felt heavy. It was hard to breathe. Eight or nine times I threw up. I smelled gas,'' he recounted. Doctors at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, said all five of those brought to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suffered lung and eye damage and from burns One child is also showing signs of bone marrow damage, said Dr. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lief-Dienstag </PERSON>, head of the pediatrics department. She said the long-term prognogis for a gassing victim is unclear. `` I can tell you what a gunshot wound is. I can tell you what's going to happen to the patient,'' she said `` But I do n't know what's going to happen to these children. I do n't know what's going to happen to their lungs in six months and I do n't think anyone else does either, including all the experts we've spoken to.'' Dr. <PERSON> Lief-Dienstag </PERSON>'s young patients were clearly uneasy when Iranian officials escorted journalists to their room. Several doctors expressed concern about infection. One, speaking on condition he not be identified, said emphatically that the news media visit `` was n't our idea.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> transferred small contingents of survivors from hospitals in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to hospitals in major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities and to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s. Dr. <PERSON> Meyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Atabaki </PERSON>, an Iranian who is an attending physician at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, said all five brought to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had to be sedated at first before they could be treated. `` They cried for 24 hours after they got here,'' Dr. <PERSON> Lief-Dienstag </PERSON> said. Hospital officials say psychiatrists are following the progress of all five patients, particularly the children, who were orphaned by the attack. `` They are innocent bystanders who ... were in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Dr. <PERSON> Lief-Dienstag </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Javan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdollah </PERSON>, 12, and her sister, <PERSON> Rezen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdollah </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Kobra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, also 9. Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, head of the department of medicine, said he and the other doctors at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s consulted experts in chemical injuries from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghent </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamani </PERSON>, a first secretary at the Iranian mission, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sent about 100 victims to hospitals abroad because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s hospitals ran out of room. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier confirmed several Iraqi attacks with outlawed mustard gas and nerve gas during the war, has sent a team to investigate the <LOCATION> Halabjah </LOCATION> attack. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, meanwhile, is accusing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of using the banned weapons. On Monday, it asked for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team to go to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to examine 88 soldiers it says were gassed.

 Ground personnel at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> airport announced they will stage 12-hour strikes on April 16 and 24. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the strikes are expected to force the cancellation or postponement of most flights on those two days. Union leaders on Tuesday said the strike would not interfere with flights for emergency, military or government purposes. Flights to and from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s islands also will not be interrupted. Waves of recent airline and railway strikes in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> over the last five months have made traveling difficult to plan. Ground crews have been negotiating for a new contract for eight months. For the last five months, the crews have staged periodic strikes. They are demanding better working conditions in the control towers, salary increases and fewer hours in the work week.

 Income tax cuts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have encouraged cuts in 10 other major countries, according to a study distributed by the Brookings Institution. `` The movement ... also reflects the almost universal recognition of the distortions and inequities created by high tax rates, years of inflation and ineffective tax preferences,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pechman </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who edited the report. Brookings is a private policy-research organization. Its study includes analyses by tax officials from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It does not deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has announced a plan for a progressive income tax _ higher taxes on higher incomes. It comes just as non-communist countries are making their rates less progressive. None of the new top rates in the 10 non-communist countries is as low as the 33 percent that goes into effect for this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1984 top rate of 88 percent will be down to 76 percent by 1990 and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 56 percent is dropping to 53 percent. The highest French rate is going down to 57 percent from 65 percent while <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s is dropping from 65 to 60 percent. Of the 10, only <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top rate of 60 percent will hold steady from 1984 to 1990. It was reduced from 83 percent in 1979, when Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> embraced the tax cut movement. One contributor to the study, <PERSON> Sijbren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cnossen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Erasmus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, criticizes the flattening of rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In most European countries ... it has long been realized that poverty issues must largely be addressed through the welfare system,'' he writes. `` As a result of these countries' pervasive social security systems, the income distribution has become much less unequal than, say 40 years ago.'' He does not mention <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the social security system is weak compared to those of western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He says the European arrangements have benefits and costs not yet fully understood. `` The system appears to be headed for a significant overhaul as populations age rapidly in the next 30 years,'' he predicts. An overview of the world tax situation was given by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Messere </PERSON> from the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the `` rich man's club'' of governments in western industrialized countries. `` Though vertical equity -LRB- progressive taxation -RRB- has been thrown out of the tax policy door, it is lurking in some areas of tax reform _ the idea being not to soak the relatively few rich, but to protect the many poor,'' he says. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> take the view that the poor should not pay income tax. ... <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> believe all or nearly all citizenas should contribute ... even if they get more back in transfer payments than they pay in taxes.''

<HEAD>Hispanic Leaders Hope To Flex Muscle In Shaping Party Platforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hispanic leaders say they are setting aside their cultural and regional differences this presidential election year and hope their unity will help them win some clout in shaping the Democratic and Republican party platforms. Former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> said Hispanics representing various countries of origin could n't even agree 20 years ago on what to call themselves. `` We've moved beyond that,'' he said Tuesday at the National Hispanic Leadership Conference. `` It's an evolving process.'' The conference, which meets during presidential election years and represents 21 national organizations, drew Hispanic leaders from across the country to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to draft a national agenda. `` We've got a good cross-representation of Hispanics from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedillo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NHLC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans, Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> are participating, Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals. We're proving we can come together and we are going to make a difference,'' <PERSON> Sedillo </PERSON> said. More than 3.5 million Hispanics are expected to vote in November's general election, according to the group. More than 300 delegates attending the conference were set to vote today on an agenda leaders hope will be included in the Democratic and GOP platforms. `` The issues that are going to be recognized and come out of this conference will speak very clearly and concretely as to what a presidential candidate should be doing to represent the needs of Hispanics _ education, employment, housing, civil rights, health,'' said <PERSON> Sedillo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` We are arriving at a consensus ... that will be very strong,'' <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> said. In its draft agenda, the <ORGANIZATION> NHLC </ORGANIZATION> calls for steps to stem the high school dropout rate _ only 50.9 percent of Hispanics complete high school compared with 77.7 percent of the general population. `` If I had to single out any one thing that would be it _ to keep our youth in school,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapanta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, director of government affairs for <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have to educate them so they can take their rightful position in society,'' he added. `` We keep filling the bottom rung, but they're not moving up.'' The conference also seeks a one-year extension for undocumented aliens to apply for amnesty and wants the president to immediately suspend the deportation of Salvadoran and Nicaraguan nationals from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And it wants a Hispanic appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Employment, housing and health are also high on the agenda for many of the leaders, concerned about the poverty and living conditions of many Hispanics. `` There are places in this country where there is a Third World situation _ in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> -RRB- </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the barrios of <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sedillo </PERSON> said. `` The whole idea is that we as Hispanics want to join in partnership with the government, with the private sector. It's time that they recognized the talent and resources we have within our own community. It's important we add the question of self-sufficiency. The community wants no handouts _ we want to join in partnership,'' <PERSON> Sedillo </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Jackson Complains About Colorado Democrats' Handling Of Caucus
Count</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, narrowly outpolled by rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s caucuses, is criticizing the state party here for the slow pace of its count and the party chief's ties to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Democratic caucuses were held across <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Monday night, but significant returns were not reported until Tuesday afternoon by the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Even before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pulled out his victory, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accused state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> of being `` biased and politically unethical'' and `` deliberately controlling the process'' by remaining as party chairman after publicly supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The state chairman endorsed Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. `` You can not very well be a fair referee and coaching another player.'' He added that the party's `` long and slow count represents a certain ineptness. ... It heightens suspicions.'' <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> countered that `` the Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is just wrong. I have never known him to just attack for his own political gain, but that appears to be what this is.'' He said his staff of six people had worked until 3 a.m. Tuesday and was back on the job by 8:30 a.m. that day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also contended that <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had changed 30 caucus sites as late as Friday or Saturday without telling his campaign. `` It comes very close to obstructing justice,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, complained about the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> situation Tuesday to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON> said the committee had contacted the state party and `` they've assured us that they're doing everything they can to get the results out.'' Returns from 77 percent of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 2,784 precincts showed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor leading with 4,029 delegates, or 44.3 percent, to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 3,528 delegates or 36.5 percent. The uncommitted delegates totaled 1,547, or 16.3 percent, and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> received 236 delegates, or 2.7 percent. If the caucus results hold up at <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s congressional district and state Democratic conventions in the next few weeks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win 20 national convention delegates, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would gain 17 and another eight would be uncommitted. Those calculations are based on returns from 77 percent of the precincts in the state. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept most of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 36 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the Republican National Convention, cornering over 70 percent of the vote in straw polls taken at caucuses Monday night. Actual GOP delegate selection will come at congressional district conventions and the state convention in June. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had hoped to use the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses as a springboard for Tuesday's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democratic primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went on to win that contest, but since there was no clear <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> victor when the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> polls opened Tuesday morning, it was not thought to have had much of an effect. Still, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign hailed the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> win. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the campaign in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, said the victory demonstrates `` that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can win in any region of the country.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also said he thought the count was fair. `` To the best of my knowledge, the party officials conducted the caucuses in a fair and appropriate manner,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself, commenting on the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> contest to reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said as far as he knew, `` it was run fairly and well.'' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> will send 51 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, with six of them `` super delegates'' who include <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter. The Monday night caucuses began a complicated, four-tier process of selecting 45 of those delegates.

<HEAD>Children With AIDS Run Into Red Tape, Funding Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who try to care for children with AIDS told a government panel that red tape and a lack of funding make a painful job even more trying. `` These most innocent victims of the AIDS crisis have the right to live and smile if only for a short time,'' <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, social worker <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithies </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> AIDS commission on Tuesday. <PERSON> Smithies </PERSON>, who has four children of her own, spends her evenings raising money to provide care for children with AIDS. Also appearing before the commission were a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> physician who asked the panel to make it easier for young AIDS victims to receive Medicaid coverage, and a single <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> woman having trouble taking in a second AIDS-stricken child. Dr. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant professor of <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said her hospital has cared for 37 infants with AIDS even though it gets no money for the care from public or private sources. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told of a 9-year-old child whose mother died of AIDS six months ago and who now lives with her grandmother. The physician said the child does not automatically qualify for Medicaid just by having the virus, and that to certify her as having the disease itself would result in her being taken from her grandmother and placed in line for foster care even though that would not be in the child's best interest. `` Help me get this child on Medicaid so I do n't have to sneak her into the hospital when she needs treatment,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` Each child with HIV -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- infection needs Medicaid whether the parent makes a million dollars or zero dollars.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, the young <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> woman adopting a baby girl with AIDS, told the commission she is having trouble getting permission to take in a second child. `` You're single, we ca n't consider you,'' she said she has been told. Then, in exasperation, she said: `` The typical young yuppie couple wants one of these kids like they want a hole in the head.'' <PERSON> Smithies </PERSON> said child placement agencies should rethink the family criteria they use when placing children with AIDS. She cited instances, for example, `` where gay men have been absolutely extraordinary as care givers.'' `` We have to expand our vision of what a family is,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> added. The three women were among 14 witnesses heard by the commission during the first of four days of hearings this month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will appeal an injunction and contempt citation even though it has dropped plans to sell its Northeast shuttle to another subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president says. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> accepted the company's report of compliance with an order he issued last month and said Eastern will no longer be in contempt once it informs employees it has dropped plans to sell the shuttle.

At a brief hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, said the financially troubled carrier had abandoned the sale plans. Bakes assured the judge that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would comply with the order. But outside the courtroom, the airline executive reiterated the company's plan to appeal the contempt citation and the injunction that bars the shuttle sale. Air Shuttle LP, the subsidiary that was to buy the <LOCATION> Boston-to-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-to-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle, withdrew its application with the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to complete the $ 225 million sale, Bakes said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ruled that the proposed sale violated a 1987 injunction that required Eastern to maintain current working conditions. That injunction prohibited Eastern from transferring ground crews to another subsidiary. The <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> contended that the proposed transactions were intended to undermine the union. Bakes told the judge the company acted on advice of its lawyers and `` never believed ... we were violating an order of the court.''

 With <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again holding the upper hand, the Democratic presidential candidates descended full force on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today for a two-week run to the crucial April 19 primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up back-to-back wins in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> this week over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, to follow up on home turf victory in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Before that, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had piled up victories in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Even before the polls closed in Tuesday's Wiscnsin contest, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> were prospecting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, hoping to stake a claim on the mother lode of the primary season thus far. `` I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, was upbeat abut his prospects. `` We go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a good campaign, a broad-based campaign, momentum, a clear messge _ a message that applies to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said Tuesday night. At stake in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary are 255 delegates. At the national convention, only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s delegation, a 336-member giant, will be larger. And that primary is n't until June 7. `` We think that if we can win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, we're going to be in a good position to dominate the last third of the primaries,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bograd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign manager. `` But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will be critical to that.'' `` No way you can underestimate the importance of this one,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a political operative of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s presence is felt in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary race, as it has been to some extent in the entire campaign. Reluctant to run for president himself, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has been equally reluctant to endorse any other Democrat. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s apparent indecision has fueled speculation for months that he might want a deadlocked convention and desperate Democrats turning to him offering the nomination. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has insisted he does n't want that, but thus far has refused to rule out accepting a convention draft. There is also a Republican primary on April 19 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with 102 delegates at stake. But it is little more than a formality as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolls toward the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. On the other hand, the Democratic primary could provide important answers, including: _ Can <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> keep up the momentum he's regained with this week's victories in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ and convince party leaders that he deserves the _ Can <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s solid support among minority voters and the backing of several prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> labor leaders overcome Jewish uneasiness and produce the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> victory his campaign now needs _ Will <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s decision to put most of his remaining eggs in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> basket prove to be anything more than a windfall for television stations who run his paid ads Along with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, most of the state's other major Democrats, such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, have remained officially neutral. Recent polls among <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading the field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent, depending on the poll. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been consistently second at just under 30 percent while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have yet to crack double digits in any of the polls. Anticipating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' victory in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bograd </PERSON> declared Tuesday evening that the campaign had become `` clearly a two-man race'' between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. While the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp was ready to write off <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who finished a distant third in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator has been campaigning hard here for more than a week. He's also hired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> political consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, who runs <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s campaigns and who occasionally advises <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been courting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s politically important Jewish community, and has been attacking <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issue of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If that message has any impact it could hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> most; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jews is already minimal following his 1984 `` Hymietown'' gaffe. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who is Jewish, has been campaigning in the Jewish community. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is relying on his strong minority support, coupled with a growing acceptance among white voters, to win more than the 26 percent he garnered in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary four years ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plans a big television buy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a tool he has n't used much in other states He also has the support of influential labor leaders such as <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, executive director of the 120,000-member <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> municipal workers union, and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a top official with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bograd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign manager, says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor will spend at least $ 1 million on his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> effort; others put it as high as $ 3 million. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also has the support of some of the top officials from the state's politically powerful teachers' unions.

 Child abuse claimed an average of three lives a day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, according to statistics supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. There were about 2.25 million reports of child abuse and neglect nationwide last year, the committee said, projecting that 1,132 of the children died of their injuries, slightly fewer than the 1,181 reported in 1986. `` The public outcry at the tragic death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> should have been repeated a thousand times over last year,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, executive director of the group, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> was referring to the widely publicized beating death last year of 6-year-old <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which last year led the nation with 166 reported abuse deaths. That was double the total for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which was second. The group also surveyed 1,250 people nationwide and found widespread support for more intensive investigation of all child abuse reports even as some states are screening their reports more carefully. The survey showed 67 percent of the people questioned believe `` public child welfare agencies should investigate all reports of child abuse regardless of the seriousness of the charge.'' The group said differences in screening and reporting methods may have been responsible for wide swings among states from the previous year in reported child abuse cases. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> reported 30 percent more cases last year and <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> 25 percent more to register the biggest increases, <ORGANIZATION> NCPCA </ORGANIZATION> said in a survey of states. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> showed declines of more than 20 percent. The survey of states showed 25 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> reporting increases over 1986, including 10 states that showed jumps of more than 10 percent in reports of child abuse. The survey of people's opinions on child abuse was conducted for NCPCA by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> polling firm of <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronca </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bucuvalas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Results had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. In the separate state survey, figures for six states were not available and four others said some deaths were still being investigated.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In turning to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president, to fill the No. 2 position at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has found a strong conservative ally. Shepherd, a 62-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney, wrote a 3,400-word article last September for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> supporting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and attacking <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s critics. On the eve of hearings into the nomination, later rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s philosophy that courts should restrain themselves in interpreting the Constitution `` is synonymous with judicial integrity.'' `` Far from being an unprincipled activist, Judge <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> is a highly principled jurist well within the jurisprudential mainstream,'' <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> wrote. But prior to serving as the president of the 340,000-member <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and 1985, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was well known to conservative activists in key policy roles in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In 1977 he first came to the attention of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> conservatives then behind the effort to get <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> elected president in 1980. While representing the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> associated with <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in a case then, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> met most of the officers of the conservative think tank that provided much of the philosophic underpinning for the so-called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution. Within a year, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was named an overseer of the institute. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> started his practice after getting a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1951 representing personal injury victims in liability suits, often on a contingency fee basis getting paid a percentage of any settlement or damages awarded. As the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s president, he vigorously defended that practice against assaults by the medical community in response to mounting malpractice claims and other defendants in liability suits. Contingency fees are a `` no-cure, no-pay system that is the key to the courthouse for many, many citizens,'' he said. `` Jurors have to understand that <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Welby </PERSON> is not our system of medical care.'' However, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> also recognized that lawyers also have an image problem. He released during his tenure as the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s president a five-year study concluding that attorneys could reduce their clients' legal costs by 75 percent through better management. `` We must move in that direction,'' he said. During that time his law practice also prospered. Setting up his own firm _ <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in 1980, Shepherd evolved from a plaintiff's attorney to a defense lawyer in liability cases. His firm's clients now include some of the nation's corporate giants, among them the <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A former bookkeeper from <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION>'s law firm who claimed she had an affair with <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> went on trial in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month and was convicted of stealing more than $ 147,000 from the firm <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, who was fired in February 1987, was accused of writing checks to herself from the law firm's accounts and admitted using the money to pay bills and buy luxury items. She claimed <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had told her to write checks to herself. But <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> denied that he had had an affair with her or that he had authorized her to write the checks. Sinner, 29, also was convicted of making a false statement to the government. She had claimed that a doctor had diagnosed her as having terminal cancer.

And together we will make this message a reality in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>.'' Complete, unofficial returns from all 324 precincts showed the 38-year-old <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> with 112,902 votes, or 54 percent, and <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> with 93,738 votes, or 45 percent. Roughly 26 percent of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s registered voters turned out for the charter referendum. Unofficial returns showed 46,854 votes against the measure, or 65 percent, to 25,458 in favor, or 35 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential contender, lent his support to opponents of the amendment to limit the city council president to two one-year terms. The ballot issue was viewed by many as an attack on City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who has led the council for 15 years and is the city's highest black elected official. The <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ordinance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reforming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Efficiency, known as C-Force, led a petition drive to get the amendment on the ballot. C-Force leaders, including blacks, contend <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> has intimidated council members by withholding federal money for ward projects and stalling legislation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s picture was used on literature against the amendment and a radio advertisement featured <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urging voters to defeat the charter amendment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recorded an audio tape in which he claims that Tuesday's special election on the amendment is an attempt `` to take away what we have gained across the years _ a share of power in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and across the nation,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national campaign manager <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> mayor <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 59-year-old self-employed tree surgeon elected as a write-in candidate in 1986, faced a recall election because of controversy over remarks he made last October at a meeting with local blacks angry over the forced resignation of Police Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, a black. The mayor, who is white, told a predominantly black crowd that if they did n't like <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> they ought to leave. `` In the annals of black history, we are always told to move and give up our rights,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the recall drive. Final returns showed 2,493 voters, or 22 percent, favored recalling the self-employed tree surgeon while 9,041 voters, or 78 percent, wanted him to remain in office. Five candidates were running for mayor in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, where a number of other local offices were being decided. Final unofficial returns showed state Sen. <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, a Democrat, had 45,517 votes, or 55.3 percent, to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s 28,142 votes, or 34.2 percent. In <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a city rocked by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s announced closing of an auto plant, incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorff </PERSON> lost a bid to win his first full term. With 33 of 34 precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> with 12,329 votes to 10,130 for <PERSON> Dorff </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, support in the black community became a heated campaign issue. When black businessman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, who finished third in the Feb. 16 primary, held a rally to endorse a candidate while paying off remaining campaign debts, <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> boycotted the event and its $ 20 admission fee. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> attended and won the endorsement. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> was elected to the state Assembly in 1974 and served there until being elected in 1982 to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where he was assistant majority leader. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, a lawyer, served in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1962 until being elected lieutenant governor in 1970, then was acting governor after Gov. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> resigned to become <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> lost to Republican <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON> in the 1978 election for governor.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Dukakis Steps Out of The Crowd, Heads for NY</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he does n't expect to land any knockout blows in the Democratic presidential nomination fight, but his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> landslide makes him the man to beat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 19 _ and at the party's nominating convention in July. No matter what the self-styled Democratic convention power brokers say. And it may mean that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the biggest surprise of the year, has peaked halfway through the primary and caucus season. In another time, a solid Democratic regular like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> carrying blue-collar <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> might not seem like much. But by the reckoning in use for the unpredictable 1988 campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scored several important successes in a single Tuesday night: _ He won a state he had to win, by more than anyone expected, and at the moment of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s greatest momentum. In any other year, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing would have been spectacular. But this week, basking in the glow of his stunning <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucus victory, pictured on the cover of Time and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, drawing boisterous crowds from one town to the next, he could not match the expectations that had been set for him. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> probably succceeded in winnowing the field as well, with Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> expected to suspend active campaigning later this week. That will mean one less white candidate to siphon off white votes in future primaries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black constituency is substantially larger than it was in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. _ He benefited from Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s failure to emerge as a strong challenger in the race. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was gaining less than 20 percent of the vote, far behind <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and now has failed utterly in a month-long bid to turn his Super Tuesday victories into success outside the South. Already, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides are trying to undermine <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, raising questions about the large loans he is relying on. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' victory should reassure the party leaders who were beginning to wonder if a son of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> would ever be able to carry one of the Great Lakes industrial states. That, in turn, should put a damper on the incessant talk of drafting <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> into the Democratic race _ and increase the odds that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> will lend his support. And along the same lines, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been working the phones, hoping a victory in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> might set off a movement of party leaders, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and governors to his side. Not so much because they are enamored of him _ they are not _ but because he is their best chance to stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who they fear would lead the party to the defeat of a lifetime if he won the nomination and led the ticket against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this fall. None of this is to say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is now the inevitable nominee. He tried to portray himself that way a few weeks ago, and it almost made him the inevitable governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> through the end of his term in 1990. He campaigned lackadaisically, seemingly worried more about collecting endorsements than votes _ and finished third in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> before being buried under <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s landslide in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> And in a year in which <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the race twice, in which the much-sought after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus prize proved worth little to winner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and in which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has broken new ground, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may yet have to fend off a charge or two before the nomination can be his. Still, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> demonstrated not only that he could win this week, but that he could do so on his own terms. Under pressure from party officials to do something _ anything _ to regroup and stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he gambled that he could do so without assaulting him and driving away the black votes so essential to a general election victory. When he offered criticism, he did cautiously, as when he said it was a `` bad idea'' for his rival to become involved in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ but then quickly added that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had issued a clarification of his own position. Instead, he attacked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sharply in speeches and in a new television commercial that evoked images of human suffering in the era of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` This administration has walked away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. They've walked away from the basic contract that says if you work hard and pay your taxes and live within the law, you have a right to a good job; and the right to a life where you do n't have to go to bed every night worried about whether that job will still be there in the morning,'' he said in a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> speech. More than that, he allowed his staff to schedule him into more informal settings, serving lunch to senior citizens at one stop and visiting children in a hospital in another.

 A woman fatally shot her husband and three of their children, then waited a day before killing herself, because she feared financial problems would break up her family, police said. `` She asked that she be forgiven for her sins,'' said <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Undersheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, quoting from one of two notes left by <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>. The bodies of Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, 38, her husband, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, 45; <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, 10, were discovered Tuesday at their home in this rural community 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said one note was brief and dealt with what should be done with the family's pet dog and property. The second, much more detailed, was addressed to her surviving son, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Alamogordo </LOCATION>. A neighbor found Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>'s body outside the front door of the home and notified police. Inside the modest pink stucco house police found the bodies of her husband and three children in separate bedrooms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON> had been shot twice in the chest and once in the head. The children each had been been shot once in the head. All were killed as they slept, probably Sunday night, police said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON> was shot once in the chest and a .22 - caliber revolver was found in her She apparently killed her husband and the children Sunday night, and fatally shot herself either Monday night or Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON> `` apparently had stayed in the house with the victims'' from the time they died until she shot herself, <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. `` Evidently no one heard the shots.'' Capt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of the sheriff's department said Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>'s note to her son <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> talked about the problems the family had endured `` She said the family was having a tremendous financial burden,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. `` She said the father required an operation and the family did n't have the money to pay for it.'' `` She said the family had been so close and that she loved her children so much that she could not live and see them apart,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. `` She said she was tired of having to live this way and she could see no other alternative.'' According to <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, one of the notes said the family `` would meet later and be together and would n't suffer any more.'' The Fusons, who had been married about 22 years, moved here about two years ago from <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, a plumber, needed a hernia operation and had been laid off several times recently. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>, said she and her sister had frequently corresponded, but there was no indication of family problems. `` Financial problems, yes, but that was n't news,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The bodies were sent to the office of the medical investigator in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> for autopsies. Outside the family home Tuesday, neighbors comforted <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, who refused to be interviewed. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, principal of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> was a sixth-grader and <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> was a fifth-grader, spent much of Tuesday counseling the children's classmates about the deaths `` They were very happy, wonderful kids,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said of the sisters.

 A tired parachutist's fatigue and his preocance says. The death Saturday of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> was accidental, although `` a man who has jumped 800 times ought to remember his parachute,'' <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday. There are no indications of foul play or suicide, and blood tests indicating whether drugs or alcohol were present in his system should be available next week, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 35, was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet and was filming an instructor and a student at <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sports Parachute Center. The videotape was mangled in the crash, but salvaged by investigators. The videotape showed that <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> jumped from the airplane and the jump was going smoothly until the parachutes worn by the instructor and the student deployed and <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> hurtled below them. `` It kind of appears he reached for his parachute and did n't have one,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` You could only see the instructor and the student falling on the video. But the release for his parachute is on his right hip, and when that right hand goes down, the left hand comes forward and it comes into camera view. `` Then the pictures get to moving real fast because he's approaching the ground at 150 mph The only thing the camera shows is the ground coming.'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'s body, found in woods about 1 -LCB- miles from the airfield. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Luman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisburg </LOCATION>, the pilot of the plane, could not be found for comment and had no telephone listing, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the pilot `` was n't in any position to see what happened in the back of the plane.'' There was no answer at the parachute center Tuesday. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON>, wife of parachute center owner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON>, was quoted in Tuesday's News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> as saying, `` No one was aware that he got on the plane without a parachute. Of course no one knew or they would have stopped him.'' Although an expert jumper, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> could have forgotten to put on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video equipment, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fayard </PERSON> said <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> worked the third shift at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of telephone switching equipment, and usually left the club at noon to get to work. On Saturday, she said, he stayed until 2:30 p.m. to shoot the video. `` He's a real perfectionist when it comes to his video photography and he'd been working a lot on it,'' she said. `` The best we can figure is he became so preoccupied with the video, and then being fatigued, that his mind was on the video.''

<HEAD>Former Siamese Twins Going Home To West Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, who spent their first seven months joined at the head, are seriously underdeveloped but have the potential to lead normal lives, said doctors preparing to release the babies from the hospital. The separated Siamese twins, now 14 months old, will return to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the next few days, physicians at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> should begin crawling soon and will go home to Ulm, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with his parents. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> will go to a German hospital for observation. `` There is no reason for us to think they will not continue to improve,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a member of the medical team that has treated the infants since they were admitted in August. `` They have made very substantial progress in the past few months and ... we're very hopeful the potential will culminate in normal existence,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said at a news conference. However, Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> stressed that the boys are not now normal. Their development is equivalent to that of 2-to-5-month-old babies. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he was unwilling to project the mental and physical level the boys will reach, but when the twins return here for evaluation next year, doctors will be able to predict fairly accurately the boys' future development. The twins have had several setbacks since they were separated in a 22-hour operation during the Labor Day weekend by a 70-member medical team. In October, their temperatures rose inexplicably for several days. The latest occurred March 13 when <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> choked on formula fed to him through a nasal tube. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said it's unknown if the incident will have long-term effects, although <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> had reached the point of turning over before the incident and has not returned to that level. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> is at about the level as when he entered the hospital and is expected to begin crawling soon, the doctors said. Because they were joined at the head, the twins were not normally developed when they arrived. The trauma of the operation and long hospital stay account at least partially for the developmental lag, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. At the time of the separation operation, doctors had given it a 50-50 chance of success. `` Certainly in terms of a medical or technical feat, it has clearly been successful,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. He said there were 48 cases in medical history of Siamese twins joined at the head. This was the first separation where both twins lived. Their kind of joining _ at the back of the head with a shared vein _ was the rarest, he said. In February, doctors implanted titanium mesh plates in the opening at the back of their heads, created by the separation of their joined skulls and a shared vein. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> has a bald spot on the back of his head from the operation, ` but if he grows his hair long he can comb it down,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Dufresne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> has a full head of hair. The twins' parents have refused to speak with reporters here. Before the separation at Hopkins they sold their story to a West German magazine. Their mother, <PERSON> Theresia </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlagi </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, has been at the hospital with the boys and has taken <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> outside in a carriage, doctors said Tuesday. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the doctors donated all their time and care and <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> treated the boys at no cost except for a small portion of the about $ 800,000 expense covered by German government insurance.

 Despite police declarations of war on cheap, potent crack cocaine, drug turf wars are transforming the city's low-income housing projects into twilight zones of violence, death and terror. `` Families are selling -LRB- crack -RRB-, families are using,'' said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bayview-Hunters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> counseling. `` It's a way of life _ survival in the projects.'' Her program has 36 clients, a waiting list of 18 and has to turn away referrals. <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, a social worker for 23 years, said the crack situation is the worst she's ever seen _ and there's no end in sight. `` We're losing a generation of young people,'' <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON> said. `` In one night you can make at least $ 400 off one person buying all night. -LRB- On -RRB- heroin you nod out after a couple hundred dollars' -LRB- worth of the drug -RRB- On crack you go on for days or as long as your heart can stand it.'' Crack, a rock-like, smokeable form of cocaine that goes for as little as $ 5 for a whitish pebble, is intensely addictive and potentially deadly to users, dealers and anyone crossing their paths. On Jan. 22, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> visited his old Hunters Point neighborhood, stepping off a bus just after midnight into a crowd of men and women, many high on crack. `` They asked him if he was a cop,'' said police Inspector <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` He told them, ` No,' and kept walking. Then they asked him if he was from <LOCATION> Sunnydale </LOCATION> -LRB- turf of a rival gang -RRB-, but when he said, ` No,' someone in the crowd said he was lying. Then they began to chase him.'' Police said someone fired a pistol at least four times, hitting <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> once in the back. He died less than an hour later. On Jan. 29, police broke up a battle between two competing gangs in a Mission District housing project. There were 32 shots fired from weapons such as an M-16 rifle, 12-gauge shotgun and handguns. On Jan. 17, a 13-year-old retarded boy in the Potrero Annex housing project three blocks from Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' home was fatally shot by police, already tense from gang violence, who mistook his toy gun for a real one. Since last fall, when the city set up a crack cocaine task force of police, the state <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, officers have made 5,506 arrests for drug sales and possession. They have seized more than 400 pounds of cocaine, $ 2.7 million in cash and 302 guns, said police Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>. `` We do put organizations out of business ... but somebody else always seems to pick up the banner and carry along. I think we're failing, quite frankly,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> The city has 47 projects with 6,800 units and 17,000 residents, but its security force merged with city police five years ago because of budget constraints. During the past year, the city has doubled its narcotics officers to 157 and the state recently assigned 18 more narcotics agents to the region. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a 20-year resident of <LOCATION> Potrero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Annex </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, said residents live in constant fear. `` Everyone in the area has been victimized by the shootings, the rash of burglaries,'' she said. `` No one has gone untouched in some manner. I mean, you have to get to your car, to the bus stop.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ranks <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> No. 5 nationally among major cities in cocaine-related hospital admissions, with 2.90 for every 1,000. At <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said that like other metropolitan public hospitals, 1 in 10 of the approximately 200 infants born there each month are addicted because of maternal drug use. The city has 11 foster homes to care for 17 `` medically fragile'' infants suffering from drug, alcohol or other medical problems. There are two or three newborns always on the waiting list, said spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Esbaugh </PERSON>. `` Practically all drug-addicted babies we are now seeing ... are at least in part cocaine babies,'' he said.

 The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, which reopened six months ago after a government-ordered shutdown, said it will cease publishing indefinitely today because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have withheld newsprint. The leftist government, which controls the purchase and sale of newsprint in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said its supply was exhausted and claimed it had warned newspapers to conserve paper until a new shipment arrives later this month. `` La Prensa suspends publication,'' said the banner headline in Tuesday's editions of the afternoon newspaper. `` Future undecided because of state control of paper,'' read another headline. `` We do n't have paper to publish tomorrow or on the following days because the government alleges that there is n't any paper in the country, but we know there is,'' said <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. The Ministry of Industry said in a statement in Tuesday morning papers that it did n't have newsprint because a shipment scheduled for March has been delayed. It said a shipment was expected by April 17. `` Once this shipment is received, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> will proceed to distribute paper proportionally according to the established mechanisms,'' it said. The ministry said it told <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and two other newspapers, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON>, that `` the contraction of paper for the year had suffered delays and that all possible efforts were being made to assure the first shipment during the month of May.'' It said the government had urged the papers to take precautions against using up their stockpiles before the end of that month. The pro-government <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said it, too, was running low on paper, but planned to publish today. Miss <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was told to hold on until March, not the end of May. She said the paper shortage marks the first time <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to interrupt service because of the government since it was allowed to reopen Oct. 1, 1987 after a 15-month shutdown. The paper was allowed to reopen under the terms of a regional peace plan signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> said the paper shortage `` could be avoided if we were permitted to handle imports ourselves.'' The government, saying <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> was promoting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression in this war-torn country, forced the newspaper to cease operations June 26, 1986. `` La Prensa, acting as a voice for the interests of a powerful aggressor, has been elevating its levels of provocation -LRB- and -RRB- disinformation, through trying to justify North American aggression,'' the government said at the time. The newspaper, whose mottos are `` Serving truth and justice'' and `` Without press liberty, there is no liberty,'' has been a vocal opponent of the Sandinista regime and has suffered censorship and shutdowns many times before. Its directors say the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> betrayed the country after the 1979 revolution that toppled the rightist regime of the late <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is at war because the Marxist-Leninist government betrayed the Nicaraguan people by deviating from the original idea of the revolution,'' <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> co-owner, said after the 1986 shutdown. Her son, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and is a leader of the Contra rebels who with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid have been trying for more than six years to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. La Prensa, founded March 2, 1926, is <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s oldest newspaper. It suffered censorship, repression and shutdowns during the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> regime, too. <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is the widow of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>'s former director who was slain in 1977. The newspaper offices were destroyed in the revolution and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was rebuilt only to suffer a major ideological division among its editors shortly afterward. About 80 percent of the staff, including <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON>, left to establish the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> did n't circulate during Holy Week because of a shortage of newsprint. `` What's strange about the case is that the newspapers <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> have published as normal,'' she said. Barricada, the official voice of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-government newspaper, did n't publish for four days over the Easter holidays, as is customary in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A secretary for <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said the newspaper also is running short of paper, but plans to publish today. She spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Barracada </PERSON> has loaned newsprint to La Prensa before.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Talks Between Sandinistas and Rebels Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAPOA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military leaders for the Sandinista government and the Contra rebels have renewed cease-fire negotiations to hammer out key details for an agreement to end a grueling war now in its seventh year. Little progress was reported Tuesday during 2 -LCB- hours of talks in this remote outpost near the Costa Rican border. Both sides accused the other of misinterpreting a peace plan signed two weeks ago and of violating a truce that started March 21. The only positive aspect of Tuesday's meeting was an agreement to continue the talks until the mechanics of the cease-fire can be worked out. The discussions were resuming today. Hopes for the peace agreement signed March 23 started to fade over the weekend when the U.S.-backed Contras postponed a meeting scheduled for today in the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> between high-ranking government and rebel officials. The Sandinistas argued that the meeting should be held because it was set out in the peace agreement. In putting off the talks, the Contras cited, among other things, the lack of progress in the technical meetings held last week. The talks Tuesday and today were held to define zones in which the rebels are to gather, outline security measures and detail how supplies will be delivered during the 60-day cease-fire, which formally started on Friday. <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, said the main concern is to `` guarantee the physical security and morale of the Contras.'' He described the talks as `` extremely delicate.'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the rebel delegation accused the Sandinista troops of systematically violating the truce, which was agreed on March 21 at the start of the three days of talks that led to the signing of the peace plan. He said the Sandinista forces fired mortars and long-range artillery into areas proposed as cease-fire zones for the rebels. `` We consider this part of the strategy to wear down the resistance's forces,'' he told journalists at the meeting at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Sandinista </LOCATION> delegation's leader, denied any cease-fire violations. But he acknowledged that last week there were `` small incidents.'' He said that was `` practically inevitable'' as long as the two sides were not separated and their armies roamed the rural mountains, plains and jungle. The government-run newspapers have charged the Contras with breaking the cease-fire. Both sides offered differing views on the major issue of the laying down of arms, which is not specifically dealt with in the cease-fire agreement. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> called it `` indispensable, a basic condition'' for the plan to work. The Contra combatants, pointing to the vast number of Nicaraguans carrying arms supplied by the government, say they will never put down their weapons. `` As long as there is no real democracy, there will be no laying down of arms,'' said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. `` When there is reconciliation, the arms wo n't be necessary.'' The Contra leaders proposed April 12 instead of today for the next high-level meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> suggested Saturday or April 15. The two sides ca n't agree on how the visit will be handled. The rebels are insisting on free movement during their stay in the capital, saying they want to meet with a variety of opposition groups. The government claims it has to guard their security. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> said, `` It's not a visit for a political campaign.'' The Sandinistas, who came to power in a 1979 revolution, signed the peace agreement at a time when they faced strong internal political, social and economic pressures. The government, backed by the Soviet bloc, retreated on several hard-line positions. They had vowed never to hold talks with the rebels, discuss internal policies or start political amnesty proceedings. The first 100 of 3,310 political prisoners were released March 29 in accordance with the peace agreement. The Contras approached the pact at a time of improved battlefield strength. But they saw the last of their U.S.-supplied military aid expire at the end of February. In signing the accord, the Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court Orders Logging Halt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A plan to clear hundreds of square miles of timber around giant redwoods in <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was halted by a federal appeals court, which said the government approved the logging too hastily. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' ruling on Tuesday came too late to block logging of about half the non-redwood timber in widely scattered areas of the forest. A different panel of the court refused to halt that operation last December while the appeal was pending. `` If you were a tourist in a redwood grove of the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, instead of finding a lush natural-vegetation forest you would find dirt and redwood trees alone,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which went to court last May to block the logging. `` They're going in with tractors and removing everything from brush to pine to oak,'' he said. The court ordered a ban on further logging in seven tracts in the forest 200 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, saying the government approved an untested logging plan without a proper environmental analysis. An industry spokesman, however, claimed victory because all logging was not banned around the towering sequoias, some of them 400 to 500 years old. `` The forest is not shut down and the mills are going to continue to operate,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Haglund </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a much more limited injunction than the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sought. It's much more of a victory for us than it is for them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> went to court after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decided that nine timber sale contracts would cause no significant damage and would not require full-scale environmental impact statements assessing the effects on the forest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> last fall refused to halt the logging, saying the dispute was one over management of the forest. The environmental group appealed. <PERSON> Haglund </PERSON> said Tuesday's injunction prevents logging of about 9 million board-feet of timber, at least temporarily until an environmental plan is developed. In a five-year plan covering the entire forest, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposes logging of 80 million to 90 million board-feet a year, <PERSON> Haglund </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> had hoped the court would address the five-year plan for the entire forest, a subject not mentioned in the ruling. But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the ruling at least will require the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to take review the plan. In approving the clear-cutting plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it would help to regenerate the redwoods by creating areas of bare mineral soil and sunlight. But the court quoted a professional forester as saying the method was experimental and unproven. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said experts have told him it ultimately would destroy the redwoods. `` By tractor-logging, almost assuredly you will end up with damage to the roots ... and often exposure of the roots,'' he said. `` The other problem is tremendous soil compaction. The water that normally would hit the ground and percolate down and provide nourishment instead erodes off of the land.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> broadened his support in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> more than he deepened it, showing an ability to appeal to more diverse elements of his party even while his share of white votes still lagged, exit polls say. While his second-place finish to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday can only hamstring <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April 19 primary, analysts said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> results did indicate that he has continuing appeal to Democrats. `` His support was more evenly distributed among the demographic groups than it was in the past. He is doing better,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. `` The question is how much better he can do, and how fast.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, had a broad victory, winning support across nearly all income, age, education and ideology groups. He won blue-collar workers, union household members and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> voters, all important constituencies in delegate-rich <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But the exit polls indicated a certain lack of enthusiasm in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support, a factor that has the potential to be exploited by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ if he finds a way to draw more white votes _ or by <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 23 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, while an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said he had 28 percent His share of the black vote was over 90 percent, the surveys said. While his white support was well over the 8 percent he got in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on March 15, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS-Times figure was about even with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> last week and less than his 32 percent in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on March 1. `` We may be looking at his ceiling here. ... If the past is any guide he's going to be in that quarter of the white vote as the upper limit,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` There's something that he's bumping up against.'' There were positive signs for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> even in his defeat. He was rated favorably by 55 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters in the CBS-Times poll. Forty percent viewed him unfavorably. `` It is n't that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't liked,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovic </PERSON>, a CBS News pollster. `` It's just that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is liked better.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a 74 percent favorable rating, 22 percent unfavorable. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters, if fewer in number, were more enthusiastic. The CBS-Times poll said 60 percent of his voters were strongly for him while 31 percent had some reservations. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s strong backers also led his weak ones by 2-1, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters were split evenly, 45 percent strong, 44 percent with reservations `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support is softer than either <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s,'' said <PERSON> Pama </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. Stronger supporters are more likely to go to the polls, an important factor when a race is close. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> poll also showed some dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among his own supporters; four in 10 said they wished some other candidate were running. At the same time, more than six in 10 Democrats overall said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would make the best nominee of the current contenders. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support from white voters in other states has been strongest among liberals with more education and higher incomes. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> it was more evenly spread, albeit still weighted toward liberals, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> poll had <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> winning 23 percent of the conservatives who voted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and 24 percent of the moderates, as well as 42 percent of the liberals. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s strongest showing was among conservatives, also 23 percent. In all, the results again showed `` a dual electorate: a black electorate and a white electorate,'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> winning only the blacks, said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. For example, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won blue-collar voters narrowly _ 41 percent to 37 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ when all were considered, but far more strongly _ 47 to 27 _ among just the white blue-collar workers. `` For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> it was a substantial victory,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he said, `` He's in a middle-America state where he's getting 23 percent -LRB- of the white vote -RRB- It's good, but the question is, can he expand it?'' The polls had margins of sampling error of about 3 points.

<TEXT>
 As military transport jets brought in the first of 1,300 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military regime said it was willing to negotiate with the opposition _ then inexplicably withdrew the offer. The government, which is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, issued a statement Tuesday saying it was willing to meet with opposition leaders in talks mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Later, the government said the statement was void and sent a messenger to news organizations' offices to reclaim it. No explanation was given for the move, and government officials met late into the evening. Opposition leaders have said they will not enter such talks until the government frees all political prisoners, allows opposition news media to reopen and promises that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be willing to resign and leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The government statement had not addressed those conditions. Also Tuesday, leading opposition activist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> asked for the protection of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after four carloads of state security police surrounded his home. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, fled his home before the police arrived and appeared later with the Rev. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military transports began touching down about once an hour at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Tuesday in an airlift that was to bring another 1,300 troops, 26 helicopters, police dogs and equipment into the country by late Thursday. The extra forces were ordered after a five-week campaign of economic and political pressure failed to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose strength lies in the 15,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February on federal charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions have since prompted <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks to close and the government has been unable to meets its payroll. The reinforcements were sent after reports <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were harassed by Panamanian soldiers and several American reporters were briefly arrested during a police raid on opposition headquarters in a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel. The government has repeatedly accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of preparing to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops arrived Tuesday in C-141 Starlifter transport jets that brought airborne military police based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. Other troops were due from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> There is no limit on the length of their stay. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has said the additional soldiers are needed to protect the 10,000 troops in the former <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> and to guard the canal, American citizens and installations. A contingent of 500 military police arrived in mid-March. The new arrivals will bring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troop strength to about 11,800. Army officials say there were no plans for the new troops to leave the old <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION>, which was turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1979 as part of the 1977 treaties that cede control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no plans to send more troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but `` would not eliminate that possibility.'' Government-controlled newspapers on Tuesday quoted <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as calling the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops potential AIDS carriers The ministry was quoted as saying tests by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel have `` a high rate'' of infection with the aquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. `` Knowing their clinical history, we can do no less than exhort our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with these soldiers,'' the ministry was quoted as saying. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said it does not test military personnel. The country's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader, Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, has been asked by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to mediate an end to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis But the government has accused <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of siding with the opposition. State-run newspapers have called the archbishop, who was born in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a `` tool of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who began her government career 47 years ago as a secretary, was sworn in as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s first female governor, saying she's proud of her new job but sad about how she got it. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, 65, widely known as `` Auntie Rose,'' commenced her term with wholesale housecleaning of the administration of <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the elected Republican governor convicted and removed from office Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> court of impeachment. She ordered <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s personal staff of about 20 off the payroll as of April 15, withdrew the names of 45 <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> appointees from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration for now and said she would review agency chiefs to see who would stay. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who had been acting governor since Feb. 5, also promised to sign a tax increase, a policy opposed by the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration, but did not know how large it would be. `` I am relieved to have the ` acting' qualifier removed from in front of the title of this office, and I am moving forward with enthusiasm,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who became <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 18th governor, told a news conference. `` Little did I realize 47 years ago that this would happen,'' she told an invitation-only group of staff members in her protocol office earlier in the day. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in 59 years to lose his job through impeachment conviction, told supporters Tuesday he is n't ready to give up politics `` This is just another chapter in a book, and this book is n't near the end,'' he said `` I have n't yet determined what my course will be.'' Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed a pro-Mecham group to drop its challenge to the May 17 gubernatorial recall election. Concerned <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> said it wanted to dismiss its case because it now sees the recall as the former governor's last hope for regaining his office. However, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he does not believe <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> can run in any election until 1990 because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removed him from the four-year term he began in January 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could decide this week whether a recall election is necessary since <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was the target. It is possible the election could remove Mrs. Mofford from office. Her chief of staff, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, said he had been negotiating with acting Secretary of State <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> in hopes of exempting Mrs. Mofford from the recall. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> believes the recall should be held as scheduled, but Mrs. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, a longtime Mofford aide, hopes to have it canceled. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has refused to comment about the recall, and a state resign-to-run law could put her in jeopardy if she campaigns actively. `` I have no idea,'' she said when asked aboput her plans for the recall election. `` The courts are going to have to decide it.'' Also uncertain was <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s ballot status. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she hoped to decide shortly on which nominations to resubmit and which agency officials to keep. Most of the nominees can continue serving in the interim and are on relatively minor boards and commissions. She also said she planned to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week to lobby for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> as the site of the Superconducting Super Collider and to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a giant canal system. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, known throughout government for her silver beehive hairdo and her stories about her days as a champion softball player, said she was proud to be the first woman in charge of the government where she has worked with 11 of the state's 17 previous governors, but added, `` It's very sad that I had to be elevated this way.'' She has been the elected secretary of state for the last nine years and had been serving as acting governor since <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in February. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> does not have a lieutenant governor.

<TEXT>
 Invigorated by victories in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today turned his attention to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with its delegate-heavy primary two weeks away. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters late Tuesday night that the results of the past two days `` give us a very, very good boost'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s `` very, very important primary. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had campaign appearances today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary is April 19; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s is a week later. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won comfortably in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and said the victory demonstrates his broad appeal. `` We have done well with people all over <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, in all income and age groups, in all parts of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' key assets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appear to be money _ he has the most to spend, possibly as much as $ 3 million _ and newfound momentum. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he placed little stock in the latter: `` I'm not a great fan of the momentum theory of politics. I'm a great fan of the marathon theory.'' Nor was he willing to say that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with 255 delegates at stake, offered him a chance to deliver `` a knockout punch'' to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wins this week. `` This is going to be a 15-round bout, and it will be a decision,'' he insisted. `` There's no such thing as a knockout punch.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who declined to directly attack <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, appeared unlikely to do so in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a state with a substantially larger black population. `` I'm not going to spend an awful lot of time criticizing other people. I think it's very important -LRB- that a -RRB- strong and positive message be the message that people associate with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked about the endorsement of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, reluctant to run for president himself but equally reluctant to anoint any other Democrat. `` I'd like to have it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He knows that. But it's his decision to make, and I'll respect whatever decision he makes It's up to him.'' He denied a published report that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had made <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as his running mate a condition of an endorsement <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a meeting set Monday with an Hasidic Jewish leader, <PERSON> Bobover </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Halberstam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. About a quarter of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s voters are Jewish. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, is Jewish, and she has noted in campaign visits here that she would be the first Jewish first lady. On Monday she made a telephone call to a Soviet Jew who is trying to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and later she talked to an audience on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about her daughter's first Passover seder away from home and her own involvement in Jewish issues. Various polls of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading, with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been consistently second at just under 30 percent, and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have yet to crack double digits in any of the polls.

 Holiday television viewers opted for a love story about British royalty over a tale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants starring <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, but part of the network audience simply tuned out. Easter Sunday was a battle of the network movies, with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> handily winning over <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. That did n't keep <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from winning the week, though, its fifth straight and 24th in the 30-week season, which ends in two weeks. For the week that ended Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 14.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 12.8 and CBS 12.6, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The season-to-date averages are: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 16.2, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.8, CBS 13.5. CBS is finishing in last place in prime time for the first time ever. The `` CBS Evening News,'' however, continued in first place, adding to the consternation of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which has seen `` Nightly News'' fall from first to third in the three-way network news race this season. In the most recent ratings, the `` CBS Evening News'' had a rating of 10.5; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had a 10.3; and `` NBC Nightly News'' 9.0. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The top-rated prime-time shows of the week were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with a 25.1 rating; `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` ALF'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Wonder Years'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Matlock'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; and `` Addicted to His Love'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The three networks lost viewers on Easter Sunday. The three-network share, or percentage of the viewing audience, is an average 71 for the season. On Sunday it was 67. It was 69 for the week. `` The Woman He Loved,'' the story of King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s abdication to marry <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> divorcee <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> won the night for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> The movie, starring <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, had a rating of 14.5 and a 25 share and ranked 27th. But the highest-rated made-for-TV movie was last Monday's `` Addicted to His Love'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which was 10th with an 18.1 rating and 29 share <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> came in second for the night with `` Superman II'' followed by a news special, `` The Unruly Dragon.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> launched the two-part `` The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' starring <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, on Sunday, but it got a 13.1 and 22 share and ranked 40th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> attributed the low rating to the holiday and a poor start on the evening with a repeat of an <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> special that was dead last in the network rankings. That showing also contributed to the low rating for a repeat `` Family Ties,'' a formerly top-10 show that landed in the bottom 10 last week. Saturday's <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball semifinals on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> ranked 38th, but apparently gave a boost to `` West 57th,'' which had a 20 share and was n't among the bottom 10 for a change. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the night with repeats.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he is going on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s big primary with momentum and a broadening base of white support despite falling short in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he had hoped to claim an important second Northern victory over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I'm a long-distance runner,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday, trying to look beyond the disappointment of two loses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in two days. `` It is a 50-state, decathalon event `` I'm not inclined to pull the flower out of the vase after every race to see if the flower's still growing,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 47 percent to 28 percent, in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a traditionally liberal-voting state where he had hoped to deal another blow to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he did in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses a week and a half ago. He also lost narrowly to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s caucuses. Both were states where expectations had been raised for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by his landslide victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, his apparent growth in white voter support in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> last week, and the huge, enthusiastic crowds he had drawn in campaigning in both states. In both states he had waged a populist campaign of appeal to the downtrodden and working people in an effort to forge a coalition of blacks, whites and Hispanics. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to draw big crowds Tuesday as he began his campaign toward <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s caucuses on April 16. He spoke to more than 7,000 students in the domed stadium at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, where he also met with Indian tribal leaders. In his Tempe speech, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> outlined in new specifics his plan for cutting $ 100 billion in annual deficits by the year 1993. He said he would freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, raising the top income tax rate from 28 percent to 38.5 percent, and moving corporate taxes back toward 1970s levels as a percentage of gross national product. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared with the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate and former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, at a large rally at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, before some 8,000 people. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race Feb. 18, praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as having `` brought new fire into the hearts of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' but stopped short of endorsing his candidacy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted there was no disappointment with his twin loses, contending he had run good campaigns and clearly established a broader base among white voters. `` We got to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a good campaign, a broad-based campaign, momentum, a clear message _ a message that applies to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has finished first or second in 30 of 40 delegate contests. `` I feel good with the pace, our momentum, and our growth at this stage,'' he said. Polling of voters leaving voting sites by television networks suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received a quarter or more of the white vote in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ somewhat more than he received in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and beyond what once had seemed a 10 percent barrier for his candidacy. `` Our white vote base continues to expand dramatically,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> results show he has `` the broadest base of support'' among the Democrats. `` We went against the odds of machinery and money and culture, and yet we see cultural expansion, we see greater participation, we see more white support, and we come out of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> with a -LRB- total -RRB- popular vote lead. ... I have to feel good about that going into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' In all the primaries so far, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads by a slight margin in the popular vote, with 3,559,364 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 3,487,843. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to protest the slow count of caucus results in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and his criticism of the state party chairman there, <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, who endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said the slow count `` represents a sort of manipulation that's not good.''

 The government will allow all prisoners freed from re-education camps to resettle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but only if they promise not to participate in future anti-communist activities, a senior official said. `` We are ready to let them go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... but these people, when they go ... they must refrain from doing anything against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nien </PERSON>, a deputy foreign minister, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nien </PERSON> on Tuesday said there were no barriers in principle to the resettlement of the former prisoners but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official must come to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to negotiate the program.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> are at loggerheads over the agency's refusal to declassify seven files the judge has ruled as relevant to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s claims of government infiltration and harassment. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> notified him Tuesday afternoon that the agency did not want to declassify the files because they contain information about sensitive national security matters. The agency reviewed the files following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>'s ruling that material in them is relevant to defense claims that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> used a former LaRouche security consultant as an informant during the investigation that led to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s July 1987 indictment. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>, who reviewed the files, has not indicated what in them he considers relevant to the case. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said he would ask the judge at a hearing today to list the material in the files he considered relevant. If judge rules the entire files should be given to defense lawyers, or that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should release portions it believes should be kept secret, the government could ask the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to overrule <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>. Testimony in the case has been halted four of the last five weeks because of battles over access to government records, mostly files of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The earliest testimony could resume is Monday.

The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has said it used <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> very briefly during the investigation of the political extremist, but the defense contends the agency is concealing <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>'s true role because he was used to entrap the defendants. The defense raised the infiltration allegations during pretrial hearings more than a year ago, but unsucessfully pursued the theory in court until gaining access a month ago to declassified documents that discuss apparent infiltration of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups. The declassified documents included a memo between former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and another pivotal figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> lawyers have accused <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> of withholding the documents and other evidence, and have said they would seek dismissal of the case following the infiltration hearings. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> also has the option to dismiss the case if he orders the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to release information and it refuses to do so. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> political organizations are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud.

 The Arabs who hijacked a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appear to be part of the Iranian-linked network of terrorists that includes the Shiite Moslem extremists who hold Americans hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hijackers, whose identity and nationality are not known, have made the same demand as the Americans' captors _ freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a tiny oil-rich desert emirate trapped in the crossfire of the Iran-Iraq war, has doggedly refused to free any of them. It reiterated Tuesday that it will not bow to `` blackmail.'' Like <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, the two Americans held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1985, the passengers and crew members held hostage aboard <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 422 have become pawns in a war between the acolytes of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and opponents of his Islamic revolution. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, like most of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Persian Gulf Arab neighbors, is a conservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historic rivals of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect who make up the vast majority of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people. Like other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> fears that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Islamic revolution will spread its way, inciting its <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> minority into insurrection. Galvanized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolution, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s long-downtrodden Shiites launched suicide bombings against the Israelis and later <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French troops who took part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> In the past five years, <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists have particularly targeted <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The 17 people whose release the hijackers demand were convicted of a wave of bombings in 1983 that killed five people and wounded 86 and culminated in attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Later terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> included an abortive 1985 assassination attempt on the emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>. Three of the 17 were sentenced to death _ two Iraqis, <PERSON> Baqer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Reda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, and a Lebanese named as <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>. The Shiite kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are particularly interested in springing <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> because he is a cousin of <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, who Western and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> intelligence believe to be the mastermind of Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, and other extremist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions behind a chain of suicide bombings, kidnappings and aircraft hijackings in recent years. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s real name is <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON>, and Western intelligence officials believe he rigged the bombs used in the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> attacks. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has so far not carried out the death sentences handed down on <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> and his fellow bombers, apparently after appeals from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But that appears to have been its only concession. Scores of other Shiites have been arrested for sabotage since 1983. In 1985, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s now-suspended <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a law decreeing capital punishment for using explosives to kill or cause terror, and life imprisonment for possessing explosives. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movement believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His family has been closely linked for many years with the Hamadis, another Shiite clan deeply involved in kidnappings. Both clans are from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on charges of smuggling explosives, have been named by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as two of the four Lebanese Shiites involved in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner in which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. The Hamadis, using various cover names, allegedly kidnapped three West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an effort to force <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> and one of his brothers, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, who is currently on trial in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> for kidnapping two Germans. A third <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the linchpin of the clan, is <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief The Mugniyehs are thought to have kidnapped <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Seized March 16, 1985, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is the longest held of the missing foreigners.

<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> told lawmakers honoring him to mark the conclusion of his 8-year-old Hawaii-based television series that the state should make it less costly for film producers to work in the islands. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> and other members of the `` Magnum P.I.'' production team were honored Tuesday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. In brief remarks before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said the `` Magnum P.I.'' production has spent `` $ 100 million pollution-free, tourism-promoting dollars in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.'' Yet <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s film industry is less than competitive because of the high costs, <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fugitive leader of an August coup attempt promised to stage new attacks on the government, but President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today said mutineers lacked enough support to oust her. A statement attributed to former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> said his group promised last November to cease hostile acts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to give her time to fulfill promises to improve the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the promises after <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s the Aug. 28 coup attempt. `` We are now withdrawing that declaration,'' said the statement from <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, 39. `` It has become obvious by its own actions, that the Aquino administration is incapable of ensuring the very survival of this nation over the next few years. We have to act and act boldly.'' The statement was distributed today to news organizations. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped Saturday from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where he had been held since his arrest Dec. 9. Military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said troops had found no trace of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> despite a nationwide search. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today told reporters her government had taken steps to correct problems raised by <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> during his abortive coup attempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded. `` I think he will have to admit that the government had adequately answered already the legitimate grievances, and I think the Filipino people definitely will go against <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` He will not be able to get any support.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s complaints included low military pay and lack of an effective strategy against communist rebels. The coup attempt was the most serious of six major bids to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she took office on Feb. 25, 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> described the <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> statement as `` a call to violence'' and said the author `` must have a distorted sense of values.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said he had ordered the military to verify its authenticity. `` The letter, as you know, threatens not only the government but the entire society,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told reporters. `` I am very sure that our people will reject such an undertaking by anyone.'' National Security Adviser <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> also doubted <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> could mount a serious coup attempt but said the government was in a state of `` watchful waiting.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> plans to go ahead with a visit next week to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In his statement, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> said he and others jailed in previous coup attempts had been detained for months without formal charges or trial. He claimed the government was more concerned about protecting the rights of jailed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> and its armed wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, rather than those of its own soldiers. `` Apparently, this administration has no intention of effecting genuine reconciliation in our fragmented society because of its inordinate fear of losing power to people whose only vision is to set a new direction toward good government and a reformed'' military, he said. `` To this day, after seven months, many officers and men implicated in the August 28 incident are still detained without charges and without trial. `` Their right to due process and speedy trial were completely disregarded by the Aquino administration despite its pretensions of being democratic and just, while affording the same rights to captured'' communist guerrillas.

<HEAD>Fisherman Snags $5 Million In Bonds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An angler says he knew `` something was fishy'' when he snagged a floating courier's bag that contained $ 5 million in negotiable bonds while heading home in a boat after a day fishing. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a 40-year-old maintenance man, turned the bag of bank securities _ five negotiable bonds worth $ 5,090,058, and some non-negotiable securities _ over to police on Tuesday. `` I did n't know what to do with them, but I knew something was fishy,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said Tuesday. After plucking the bag from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Saturday, he asked asked neighbor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSpisa </PERSON> to look at the papers. `` He was flabbergasted when I told him what they were,'' <PERSON> LaSpisa </PERSON> said. `` He said ` Oh, my God.' We started to shake.'' Bonds that are negotiable can be cashed in by the bearer rather than the registered owner of the bonds. LaSpisa, a retired district manager for a book manufacturer, said the pair did n't really consider keeping the bonds. `` I'm sure there was a way to cash them in if we wanted to, but we wanted to take the honest way,'' <PERSON> LaSpisa </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping we'll get a little compensation for it.'' He said that after he examined the bonds he called a friend, a retired police detective, who advised him to turn in the satchel. The bag, stamped `` DHL-Worldwide,'' was reported missing Saturday from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where it was being moved from a terminal by a <ORGANIZATION> DHL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> van, said police spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police began investigating after the van driver, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Doer </PERSON>, reported that the bag apparently had fallen out of the van, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DHL </ORGANIZATION> collected the satchel Tuesday. A company spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, said he could not comment because the matter was under investigation. <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said the courier service's policy is not to carry negotiable instruments. Asked why he was turning in the bonds, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> replied, `` I'm just trying to do the right thing.''

 `` Fatal Attraction,'' nominated for an Academy Award as best film, will not win any prizes from this quiet, suburban hamlet. In fact, the ruckus that accompanied the movie's filming here prompted the town board to approve an ordinance Tuesday tightening restrictions on movie-making. Board members voted 3-2 to make film crews appear before the board to obtain a permit, whether the filming is on private or public land. Town Supervisor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said the community is often used for films and television commercials, but `` Fatal Attraction'' caused too many problems. He said the film crew blocked roads when school buses were trying to get by, annoyed townspeople with bright lights for night filming and rented private property for commercial use. `` No matter what urging we gave, no matter what cooperation we asked, there was continued abuse,'' <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 More than 200 photographs of bound, tortured men were found in the bedroom of a man whose house and yard yielded skulls and bone fragments after his arrest on assault and sodomy charges, police said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s $ 500,000 bond was revoked Tuesday at a court hearing in which a police officer said one man, photographed bound and hanging from his ankles in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s basement, appeared to be dead. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, was arrested Saturday after a 22-year-old man wearing only a dog collar told police Saturday he had escaped from <LOCATION> Bardella </LOCATION>'s home after four days of torture and sexual assault. <PERSON> Bardella </PERSON> was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy and one count each of felonious restraint and first-degree assault. Authorities have searched <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s house and yard since his arrest, after the man apparently escaped from <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s three-story house by jumping from a second-story window and asked a neighbor to call police <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, a neighbor, said <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> told him about five years ago he was using his home as a halfway house for runaways and that young men often visited the house. `` I thought he was a father figure to those kids and I got adjusted to the fact that there were boys at his house,'' said <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> also organized a neighborhood watch program after moving into the house on <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, in a lower-middle class section of midtown <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 16 years ago. `` He led us to believe he was a nice guy, a leader in the community,'' <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. `` He was very active and made us feel like second-class residents because we were not active.'' On Tuesday, investigators using shovels and a backhoe found small bone fragments in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s back yard, but police did not know whether they were human bones. Two skulls, one of which appears to be a relic, were found inside <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s home Saturday. A third was discovered buried in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s back yard on Sunday. All are thought to be human. The buried skull still had hair and what appeared to be deteriorating flesh on it and in the earth around it, according to evidence in the hearing before Associate Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stitt </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forensic anthropologist told police the skull had been buried for no more than a year, and probably was buried about three months ago. Police found the photographs in a bedroom dresser near a room where the 22-year-old man was believed held captive, Detective <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurn </PERSON> said during the hearing. According to court records, the man's clothing and pieces of rope bindings he said he had burned with matches to escape were still in the room when police searched the house. Police also reported finding torture and bondage devices, which they refused to describe. When police first entered the house Saturday, they found freshly poured concrete in the basement, but drilled through the concrete on Sunday and found nothing suspicious. Police also found files in the house that contained information from newspaper articles about the disappearance of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, 19, who has been missing since 1984, <PERSON> Hurn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, has contended for several years that <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was responsible for the disappearance. When <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> appeared for a court hearing Monday, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> lunged at him and had to be restrained by police. Police have confirmed that they are examining <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s possessions for possible links to the unsolved disappearances of <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> and others

 A small-town marshal who may have faked his own abduction to gain attention from his estranged wife, prompting a search by about 200 law officers and volunteers, has been fired. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' dismissal Tuesday by the town aldermen was made retroactive to Friday, when he reappeared from a daylong absence saying he had been kidnapped at gunpoint and escaped. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, the only police officer for the town of 870 residents, did n't attend the aldermen's meeting Tuesday night. City Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said he would meet with Sheriff <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> today to discuss the case. The search began after <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' patrol car, its engine running, and handgun were found outside a convenience store where he had reportedly gone to investigate a burglary early Thursday. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> reappeared about 2:30 a.m. Friday in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, and told authorities the abduction story. He had spent a night in an abandoned house, investigators said. Investigators with the state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that they had determined the kidnapping story was false, but offered no motive. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> has declined to comment on the case, but his stepmother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> has said he fabricated the highly-publicized incident to gain attention from his estranged wife. `` It pushed him to the deepest end to do such a horrible thing,'' she said earlier this week. `` It's a sad situation.'' `` It hurt us,'' she said. `` We're relieved we know about it and can get him some help.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' estranged wife, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, said Monday that she was shocked by the incident, but declined any further comment.

 Police arrested a couple accused of running a multimillion-dollar prostitution ring that used a computerized client list and beepers to page its 450 hookers, authorities said. A woman cooperating in the investigation led police to the alleged ringleaders, <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON>, 40, and his wife <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, 39. They and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigoda </PERSON>, 43, were indicted Tuesday on charges of promoting prostitution. The alleged ring advertised in the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Screw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> as the Play <ORGANIZATION> Mate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and Party Mates. It had a client list of 4,500 and operated out of an apartment in the <LOCATION> Whitestone </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Investigators infiltrated the ring in December by inviting two of the service's employees to a bogus bachelor party. Police said the women agreed to strip, perform lesbian sex and entertain the groom and best man for two hours for $ 750. Police raiding the apartment found six phone lines and 20 phones. `` Their records and client list were computerized and the prostitutes carried beepers,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pless </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney. `` From what we could gather, the take was over a million -LRB- dollars -RRB- a year and they had been in operation for a couple years,'' <PERSON> Pless </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON> was freed on $ 50,000 bail after being arraigned before <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerny </PERSON>.

 Three of the 30 Kuwaitis aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet hijacked to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are named <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, indicating they are among the estimated 1,200 people who belong to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state's royal family. The airline identified the three, who were in the first-class section, as <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, a man, and two women, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. The two women have been identified as sisters of <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON>. Like all other male members of the royal clan, <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> can carry the title of sheik. Sources in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity on Tuesday said <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> is a businessman and distant relative of the royal family. The <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> dynasty has ruled <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for more than two centuries and oversees vast oil wealth that gives it one of the world's highest per capita incomes. The riches that began to flow from the discovery of oil were used in the 1970s to set up a modern welfare state. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, until recently, also boasted the only elected parliament in the region. But since 1980, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and its royal family have been plagued by terrorism blamed on Iranian fundamentalists who have pledged to spread their revolution throughout the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states. The emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, survived an assassination attempt in May 1985 by a suicide driver who tried to crash a bomb-laden car into the royal motorcade. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> escaped with minor wounds, but two security men and two pedestrians were killed along with the bomber. The terrorist attacks have included bombings and the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in 1984. In that incident, two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> passengers were slain by the hijackers, who demanded freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies and other targets in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983. The Arabs who hijacked the Kuwaiti airliner Tuesday made the same demand. The fundamentalist <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> rulers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who have been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for 7 -LCB- years, accuse <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Members of the <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> clan fill most senior posts in the government, the army, the police and both the private and public sectors of the emirate, which has a population of 1.7 million. They include the crown prince and prime minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, and the ministers of defense, interior, foreign affairs and information. Even the hijacked plane is named after the ruler and has the word <PERSON> Al-Jaberiya </PERSON>, Arabic for `` the plane of the Al-Jabers,'' emblazoned on its side.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar stayed mostly higher in quiet European trading this morning after a brief early rally lost momentum. Gold prices fell as the dollar appeared to hold on to recent gains, but dealers said they did n't expect the precious metal to fall much further. Traders in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said any movement in the dollar this week is likely to be limited, slow and hesitant because no major economic news is expected. `` People are still bearish, but there is fear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is tightening monetary policy in order to control inflation, and this has created some uncertainty,'' one Italian trader said. He added that this uncertainty is likely to persist until the April 14 announcement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February. Dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> cited few fundamental reasons for the dollar's recovery. One cited higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and another said the dollar received some support Tuesday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve sales of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s pound. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 125.03. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly higher at 125.055 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates: _ 1.6692 West German marks, up from 1.6690 _ 1.3770 Swiss francs, up from 1.3765 _ 5.6575 French francs, down from 5.6605 _ 1.8735 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8700 _ 1,237.50 Italian lire, up from 1,234.50 _ 1.2390 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the It cost $ 1.8780 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8800 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 452.30 a troy ounce. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 450.80, down from Tuesday's late bid of $ 451.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 451.10, down from $ 453.50 late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold dropped $ 5.60 to close at a bid $ 453.21. Silver also fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today. It was selling at a bid price of $ 6.59 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $ 6.65.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 27 Remains Believed To Be Those Of Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military guards today reclaimed 27 remains believed to be those of Americans killed in the Vietnam War _ the largest such repatriation since 1973. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team saluted as the remains, each in a metal case topped with a folded <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, were loaded one by one onto a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane for a flight to army laboratories in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The brief, solemn ceremony was held under overcast skies. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also returned three other remains they identified as those of ethnic Asians but who could be missing Americans. It was the largest such transfer of remains since the last American forces withdrew from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on March 29, 1973, opening the way for the communist victory in April 1975. Three million Americans served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and 58,000 died. Also today, Vietnamese officials angrily rejected charges that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> was dragging its feet on accounting for 1,767 Americans who remain listed as missing in action in the war. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has threatened to end its cooperation in repatriating other American remains if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> maintains its criticisms. In a meeting today with visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> responded heatedly to a recent Pentagon suggestion that the communists have been storing remains and returning them little by little, said an American negotiator requesting anonymity. The head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s accounting office for missing in action, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, had dismissed the charge as `` nonsense'' the day before. `` The next time they make such a statement, we will have to reconsider whether we will do the job. This shows there is no goodwill on the part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' At today's ceremony, two dozen peasants in bamboo hats and other bystanders with bicycles squatted in an adjacent field to watch as the remains were turned over at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Noi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bai </PERSON> airport. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> joined the team from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center in saluting as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guard placed the caskets into the belly of the C-141 plane. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualty team, said the Vietnamese provided a list of names for at least half of the 27 remains. Some of those names are on the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list, he said. Most caskets contained many sizable pieces of bone, he said. Some of the remains were reportedly found near <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, suggesting they are those of airmen shot down during intense <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing runs in the heartland of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made such cases a priority because it says those remains are most likely to be located. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which have no diplomatic ties, frequently have bickered over the issue of remains, and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> thus far has returned 152 remains that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed as those of Americans missing in action. The previous largest transfer was Aug. 14, 1985, and involved 26 remains, at least 24 of which were positively identified as Americans. `` This being the largest, we hope it means increased collaboration,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Byla </PERSON> said today. However, she agreed with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has more information about remains than it has divulged. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> said he told Thach many Americans believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was not forthcoming on the issue and may even still be holding American prisoners of war. He said <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> responded that if any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen had evidence of such prisoners, the foreign minister would personally accompany him in a helicopter to investigate. `` After this trip, I'm more convinced that they are making a full faith effort to close this chapter, but it's not closed in the minds of many Americans,'' said <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, a Vietnam War veteran. It was the fourth return of remains since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed in August talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> to resume repatriation efforts after months of deadlock. But <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nien </PERSON>, on Tuesday charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had failed to carry out its part of the agreement. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was awaiting direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for postwar reconstruction. If it wants a full accounting of its missing, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> must demonstrate `` its concern, its direct commitment,'' he told <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>.

 An early morning fire roared through a house where more than eight people were staying, killing four people and injuring five, including a firefighter, authorities said. An undisclosed number of children were missing, they said. The fire broke out about 5:30 a.m. in the two-story house in the Bayswater section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> borough, and spread to a second alarm before being brought under control shortly before 7 a.m. `` Apparently it was a well-advanced fire before units arrived,'' said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Firefighters who went inside the house `` found one body just inside the door and three bodies up on the second floor,'' he said.

He declared that his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative nevertheless was `` intact and alive.'' The stop in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> primarily was a courtesy call on President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who played a leading role in shaping <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations and is the only regional leader to endorse it <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has insisted, however, on a direct role in the talks for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has ruled out. In a statement to reporters moments before he left <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he made some progress but `` the differences have n't been substantially narrowed.'' `` There's no masking the deep-seated obstacles to peace,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport. `` Emotions are deeply felt, principles are proudly held, great traditions, cultures, and rights are involved ...

It is there for the taking.'' After talks with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, to continue talks with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. His <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip will also take him to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with his talks with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who he said posed many questions about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan, `` thus indicating a serious engagement in the search for peace.'' Earlier today, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held final meetings with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` When you are down in the trenches doing it, you certainly are aware of how hard it is,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after seeing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` But that does n't lessen the importance of continuing the effort.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Tuesday night from a 15-hour trip to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, where he sounded out <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders on the peace plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he had not received a clear answer to his peace plan from <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who requested clarifications from the Israelis. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as saying President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was `` negative'' about the plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would not return to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on his current shuttle. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying they did not rule out the possibilty of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s returning Saturday `` if he has something to discuss.'' Returning from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` I can not report any particular sense of convergence on our initiative at this point.'' But he said all sides had urged him to continue. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative calls for negotiations in two stages. The first would seek to establish some self-rule for Palestinians who live in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The second would deal with the settlement of the 40-year <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Four months of anti-occupation rioting in the occupied lands have left more than 135 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. In an interview in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> on Tuesday with a group of Jordanian editors, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said a total <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was not `` in the cards.'' He opposed a separate role in the negotiations for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which he said called in its covenant for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s extermination. And, he said, an independent Palestinian state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would not be viable economically and did not `` make sense.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the ethnic aspirations of Palestinians should be taken into account: `` We seek some workable way these interests can be served.'' At the same time, he said negotations must be based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that call on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to yield territory captured in the 1967 war in exchange for peace. Without explanation, the interview was not shown on Jordanian television Tuesday night. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday that both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> were prepared to hold negotiations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on an overall settlement. `` But there are all sorts of questions,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, especially on how negotiations on Palestinian self-rule would be linked to dealing with an overall settlement. `` I do n't want to give any big plus sign because that would not be warranted by the facts,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Damascus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> made four demands in connection with a peace settlement, including complete <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the occupied lands and establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.

<HEAD>Laxalt Gets Partial Award of Legal Fees In Suit Against Newspaper

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> says an award of nearly $ 650,000 in legal costs makes him the victor in a more than four-year libel battle against <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The public knows well that winners are n't ordered to fork over hundreds of thousands of dollars, and no amount of distortion by the Bee -LRB- newspaper -RRB- regarding today's decision will dispel that basic fact,'' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` This should prove that it is not impossible for a public servant to win the good fight against a wealthy and powerful newspaper chain.'' The award, announced Monday, marks the end of a protracted legal battle that began in November 1983 when the Bee newspapers in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> published an article about the family of <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, a longtime confidante of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then a Republican senator from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The article alleged that the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had evidence of skimming at the <ORGANIZATION> Ormsby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hotel-casino in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> while the <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> family owned it in the early 1970s. The action was dropped in June 1987, and the two sides then entered arbitration over fees, with <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>'s side requesting approximately $ 4.3 million in fees and costs. The three-member panel _ <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> B. Bell, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tone </PERSON> _ entered their award last Thursday for $ 647,454 in fees and costs, which will be paid by <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>'s insurance carrier. The award also provides that $ 130,363 in fees and expenses for the arbitrators will be shared by both parties. <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it would have preferred its insurance company not pay any of the fees, but called the award `` fair to all parties.'' `` We are pleased that this long legal battle is finally over, but let's hope its lessons are not forgotten,'' the publishing company said in a statement. `` The First Amendment is meaningless without a strong, independent and vigilant press willing to stand up for its beliefs.'' `` It's a hell of a victory,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>. `` That's over half a million in counsel fees that <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> does n't have to pay. You only pay counsel fees to the winner.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Laxalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> already has paid $ 680,000 in legal fees related to the case, according to <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, who runs a political consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> is not required to pay reimbursement for those costs.

 Two men fled from a laundry after their gasoline-soaked clothes caused an explosion in a washing machine, and the laundry manager's hair was singed when the machine exploded again while he tried to drain it. `` They probably just did n't know any better. It was just a stupid thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laundry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Cleaners. He said the garments appeared to be those of painters. He said the men may have used gasoline to remove paint from the clothes before washing them and he does n't think they meant to endanger anybody. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said he was sitting in his office Monday when he heard a boom, and he saw two men running out the door, one of them with singed hair. He said five to 10 people were washing their clothes at the time in the coin-operated laundry. `` I assumed the guy had been hurt; I did n't think they were running away,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. Then <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> found that the five machines the men had been using reeked of gasoline. `` I opened the lid and you could smell the fumes,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. `` You could see the gasoline floating on top of the water.'' A few minutes later, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was trying to drain the water from the machines when fumes from the machine he was standing in front of ignited. `` It singed my eyebrows and hair. I've got some blisters on my cheeks,'' he said. Several machines were damaged and the laundry's front window shattered, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said Fire investigator <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said investigators are looking for the man who loaded the clothes, just to make sure he is n't hurt and to warn him of the danger of gasoline. `` But I'm pretty sure he knows now,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> gunners fired four rockets into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> during this morning's rush hour, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 16 people were killed. Earlier, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes blasted a supertanker near an Iranian oil complex in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said six children were among those killed when four rockets hit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s capital at the same time. It said `` many'' others were wounded and that a hospital and nursery school were hit. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said 15 other civilians were killed in Iraqi air raids on six towns in the southeasetern <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said four missiles were fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` the nest of hypocrites and charlatans,'' at 9:29 a.m. -LRB- 1:29 a.m. EDT -RRB-. It was one of the heaviest single barrages on the Iranian capital since the so-called `` war of the cities'' was rekindled Feb. 29. Since then, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been pounding the Iranian capital with missiles, usually firing only one or two at a time. The Iraqi agency said <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Qasr </LOCATION> port cities were hit with missiles and artillery during the night. It said one missile hit an elementary school in <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Qasr </LOCATION>, killing three students and wounding 50 other children and teachers. The agency also quoted a military spokesman as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets attacked `` a very large maritime target,'' a usual reference to a supertanker, off Sheik Sho'eyb, which is more commonly known as <LOCATION> Lavan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the air raid, which apparently occurred Tuesday night. <PERSON> Lavan </PERSON> island is a key offshore Iranian terminal for underwater pipelines from central gulf oilfields of <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION>. It lies 450 miles south of the main <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> battle ground which is at the northern edge of the gulf. The unidentified Iraqi spokesman said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes `` dealt an accurate and effective'' to the vessel off <PERSON> Lavan </PERSON>. He said the attack was `` a part of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s continuous effort to cut off the criminal Iranian regime's oil supplies.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> depends on a tanker fleet to shuttle its oil through the gulf under the threat of Iraqi attacks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has safer outlets for its oil exports, which both countries badly need to finance their costly war, now 7 -LCB- years old. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil is shipped through piplines across <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported its gunners fired two missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Tuesday, two into the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and one into <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

Confederate Flag</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> members in four neighboring states have offered to march with Oklahomans in protest if the Confederate flag flies again at the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>, the state president of the organization said. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <PERSON> Enid </PERSON>, 93 miles north of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said executive committees and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> offered to march at the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> and in their own states. `` We are also soliciting a coalition of other groups to participate,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> signed a joint resolution requiring the Confederate flag be flown over the Capitol but said the flagpole will remain empty until the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> tells him which of three flags used by the Confederacy from 1861 to 1865 they want. Black legislators had opposed the resolution, saying the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. `` They fly it, we're marching,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The flag has sparked controversy in several other Southern states recently. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the state flag, which incorporates the design of the Confederate banner, and in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, black lawmakers were arrested for trying to remove a Confederate flag from the Capitol dome. For years, the Stars and Bars flag used by the Confederacy until 1863 was part of a 14-flag display south of the Capitol steps, but the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> removed the flags during recent renovations. The flag display represents the countries that have claimed a portion of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> territory in the past, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> has said the existence of the Confederacy and its control over a portion of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> are undisputed facts, and the display is in historical context.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, calling his overwhelming <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> victory over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a sign that voters think he has `` the strength and the experience'' to be president, said today another win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary could clear his path to the Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted that despite twin losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> `` at this stage of the campaign, I feel very good.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor won his first Midwestern primary on the strength of the blue-collar vote Tuesday, helping to ease doubts about his appeal even as it was raising questions about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s ability to turn his enthusiastic crowds into success at the polls. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also rang the closing bell for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign, giving the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator a last-place finish. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was at home today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reassess his campaign and aides said he would make a statement Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> spent heavily but remained an also-ran in third place. Just as <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did here, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has put all his chips on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> today, party chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> was asked if he felt relief that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had won and set aside at least temporarily the question of a Jackson ticket in the fall. `` Not relief,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> replied. `` I was impressed with the results of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had shown `` toughness to stick to the issues.'' `` The people looked at us and made a decision as to who they thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead this country ... Fortunately, I was on top,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` I hope I can do the same in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I believe I can and go on and win the nomination.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who appeared on `` CBS This Morning,'' congratulated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for running `` a good, effective campaign'' in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but noted his own strong showings to date. `` Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or No. 2 in 30 of them and I have 250,000-plus popular vote lead and so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contest puts the spotlight on Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked convention. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' win is likely to tone down talk of drafting <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> or another Democrat. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor has not made an endorsement, but the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp is hoping the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> win could put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor. There was a Republican primary in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but there were no doubts. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the nomination his in everything but name, bested <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> by a 10-1 margin. In the Democratic battle, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the boost he had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. `` I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of what he called `` a great victory.'' With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 481,857 or 48 percent, to 285,575 or 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 176,009 for 17 pecent, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> drew only 48,877 about 5 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> edged <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among blue-collar workers, network exit polls said, and won white union workers outright. That was good news for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who needed to show he can win that group, which is key to the party's hopes in the fall. Even in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, home of the doomed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plant where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had made a splash by joining the picket line, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won with better than a 2-1 margin. `` I'm doing very well with working families ... because people see in me someone who does n't just talk about jobs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also won in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses, which were held Monday, even though the counting dragged into Tuesday. With 77 percent counted, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won with 44 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 37 percent. Uncommitted groups took 16 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 3 percent. In the Republican caucuses in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won easily over <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s campaign was in serious trouble after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stunning victory in the March 26 caucuses But he has now won three of four events in the past eight days _ adding <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> caucuses over the weekend. `` This is going to be a 15-round bout and it will be by a decision ... there's no such thing as a knockout punch,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The delegate numbers showed why the Democratic race could continue to drag on. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved ahead, but the party's rules splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> close. Despite his victory margin, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up on 43 delegates in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to 26 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won 12. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up 21 national convention delegates and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 17. The other seven are uncommitted. That, plus partial <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> results, left the AP delegate count this way: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 735.55; <PERSON> Jacksn </PERSON>, 706.55; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 394.8; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 170.5; and uncommitted 516.6. A total of 2,082 votes are need to win at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Tuesday's results give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the momentum going into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single state thus far. Then comes the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, where the rules could allow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win the lion's share of the delegates, on April 26. Perhaps equally important, his victories this week give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> new, stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. With the pledged delegate count still close, the verdict of the unpledged super delegates _ governors, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ could provide the numbers to give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a majority. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vowed to press on. `` I'm a long distance runner,'' he said.

Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has denied involvement. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most influential Shiite cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, called on both sides to lay down their weapons. `` We prohibit this fighting because it burns <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s causes and the Moslems,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. The battles, which started Tuesday near the inland market town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, today spread to the port of Tyre and surrounding villages, police said. In today's bloodiest clash, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen fought <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> before dawn and recaptured three offices lost late Tuesday, said a police spokesman who insisted on anonymity. Six people were killed and 17 injured. Amal militiamen also stormed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions in the village of <LOCATION> Siddiqine </LOCATION>, 8 miles southeast of Tyre, killing one person and wounding four. The duel started Tuesday when <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen attacked an Amal checkpoint near <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, killing an Amal militiaman. Relations between the two groups unraveled after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> was `` harassing the believers by seaching for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was serving as chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer in the area when he was kidnapped Feb. 17. His abduction has been claimed by the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a pro-Iranian underground group believed to be affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is believed to be an umbrella group for pro-Iranian underground factions holding most of the 22 foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1985.

 An Israeli girl and two Palestinians were killed in a clash today between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians and Arabs in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and other sources said. The radio said the dead girl was in a group of Israeli tourists in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, a village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. It said three Israeli children were injured. Arab sources said the Israelis were settlers. The Palestinians, identified by hospital officials as <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseh </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabr </PERSON>, 22, died in a clash with Jewish settlers while working in their fields at <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Both were shot in the head during a clash at <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. They said two other Palestinians were seriously wounded. Before today, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports listed 138 Palestinians as being killed by Israelis since unrest broke out in the occupied territories on Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to promote a peace plan aimed at settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute, met today with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged he did not win needed support for the peace initiative but vowed to continue his efforts. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Tuesday to discuss the peace plan. Later, he said he could not report any progress. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, the army took over the homes of six <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> families east of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> for 10 days, forcing them to live in tents, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The army earlier had converted about a dozen <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> schools into military bases and used some as temporary detention centers. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, troops ordered <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> passers-by to paint over slogans proclaiming `` No to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'' and `` Shultz Go Away'' scrawled on shop walls, an Arab shopowner said. In the morning, troops forced stores and vegetable markets shut in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, in the Jabaliya refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Protest leaders have ordered merchants to stay open in the morning and observe a strike in the afternoons. In Jabaliya, the soldiers' orders prompted a brief clash between stone-throwing refugees and troops firing tear gas, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Arabs sold produce on street corners near the market area, running away when troops appeared, the witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> on Tuesday, an Arab teen-ager lost his left eye after being hit by a rubber bullet fired by troops, and soldiers wounded a second Arab youth in a separate clash, the army said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a group of Israelis who have been hurt in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terror attacks held a vigil in front of the hotel where <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was staying. They said the secretary's peace mission rewards <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> violence. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit is like oil on the fire of terror,'' said reserve Gen. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagi </PERSON>, former head of army intelligence. Israeli soldiers on Tuesday foiled an attempt by Palestinian guerrillas to cross the northern border about 100 yards from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> settlement <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON>, the army said. Troops exchanged fire with the guerrillas, who were armed with Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and about a dozen hand grenades, army officials said. Two guerrillas were killed and a third was captured. Four soldiers were wounded. Two groups affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the infiltration attempt: <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>.

 A windsurfer out on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather saved a boy from the choppy water, but a second child was missing today, police said. The rescued boy, 11-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, was one of two children on an inflatable raft that was pushedaway from shore by high winds and waves Tuesday afternoon. Missing was 10-year-old <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Divers called off their search for her when darkness fell, and winds gusting to 50 mph this morning prevented them from resuming the search, police said. Crews are checking the lakeshore and will go out onto the lake as soon as winds subside, Officer <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcianik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulk </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said as he arrived at <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to windsurf he `` noticed someone was in a rubber raft tht was way out,'' but as he was setting up his board he saw that they had jumped off and were fighting to swim toward shore. <PERSON> Tulk </PERSON> said he fell into the water twice on the way out to the children because the wind was `` screaming.'' `` I saw the closest one to me go under water, so I jumped off my board and grabbed him,'' <PERSON> Tulk </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday night. `` I could see him bobbing completely under water _ I figured he was about to cash it in.'' <PERSON> Tulk </PERSON> said he told the boy to hold tightly to the straps on the board. `` He looked like a frozen mouse,'' he said. `` All he was wearing was a pair of shorts.'' Temperatures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday reached 85 degrees, but the lake temperature was only about 40 degrees. <PERSON> Tulk </PERSON> said he was struggling to paddle toward shore when a helicopter arrived on the scene, and a diver helped them to the beach. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was in fair condition at Children's Memorial Hospital, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Canick </PERSON>, a nursing superviser. `` The boy is called a near drowning and he's in for observation,'' she said.

 A judge held <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in contempt of court today and fined the television rating company $ 500 a day for failing to turn over ratings of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newscasts sought by attorneys in a murder retrial. Attorneys for <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had sought the ratings information as a basis for motions to delay or move <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s retrial for the 1973 slayings of six members of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family in southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Defense attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he wants to use the ratings of local television news programs to show how widely the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> case has been publicized in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Jury selection began Monday for the retrial, which was moved from <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> ruled <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> in willful contempt of court and said he was concerned that its refusal to produce the information would `` cause real problems in the prosecution of this case.'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> the Chicago-based company regretted not being able to produce the material, but said complying with the subpoena would disrupt <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s business by making it compile information that is not already available. He also said it would present a continual threat of requests in similar trials. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> would appeal immediately to the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was one of three <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison escapees convicted of murder and sentenced to death in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for the slayings of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, his brother, his three sons and his daughter-in-law.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge denied a request by jurors for a trial transcript, telling them to rely on memory and notes while deliberating in the case of 13 white supremacists, including nine accused of sedition. Deliberations were delayed today because one of the jurors has a sick child. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said juror <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittenburg </PERSON> went to a hospital to see about his baby and that the third day of deliberations was postponed until he could rejoin the jury. Nine defendants are charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by violence, and one of them, along with four other defendants, is charged with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. Two of the sedition defendants are accused of the interstate transportation of stolen money. In denying three jurors' requestion for the transcript Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said the document would be 7,000 pages long and would not be ready for three or four months. He also denied their request to re-hear lengthy portions of testimony. The government called 113 witnesses and the defense had 79 in the trial which began Feb. 16. The case went to the jury Monday afternoon and lawyers, defendants and others waited at the federal courthouse on Tuesday. One defendant, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, is serving a 150-year sentence for violating the civil rights of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio talk show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> by killing him, and 100 years on a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> conviction for racketeering. Defendant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, free on $ 50,000 bond, said he would have attended the trial even if he were not a defendant. `` I would n't have missed it for the world,'' he said. `` This is where the devil is. This is evil personified, the whole crew.'' Defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the trial is a move by the government to snuff out views that do not meet government approval. He said he expects to be acquitted, `` but in any case, they win: They break us financially.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who also is on trial and is being held without bond, are considered three of the top leaders of the white-supremacist movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But one of <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> are `` through fighting. Miles is 63. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is 70. Beam has got a 20-year-old wife.'' Acquittal would slow the movement, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, because it would show that white supremacists `` can get a fair trial in American courts.'' The sedition defendants face up to 20 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine if convicted. The murder charge carries a maximum of life imprisonment and the interstate transportation charges have a maximum term of 10 years and a $ 10,000 fine. The government also contends that some of the defendants committed a series of robberies to finance their activities. The robberies netted about $ 4.1 million, of which about $ 1 million is unaccounted for, the government said. The key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, testified that the white supremacist group he led in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> carried out bombings to advance a conspiracy begun in July 1983 at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, at an Aryan Nations conference. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Defendants who attended the 1983 meeting have said that there was no conspiracy and that <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> has made up the story in hopes of getting a sentence reduction.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is trying to fill a key <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post left vacant by a protest resignation, after settling for his second choice for the department's No. 2 post. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced Tuesday that he is recommending former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> for the No. 2 job. He also said he has chosen <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for the department's No. 3 position, which had opened before six protest resignations rocked the department last week. Still unfilled is the job of head of the department's criminal division. The choices announced Tuesday drew support from the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last week had conveyed congressional concern to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> over problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the protest resignations by Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> of the criminal division, and four of their aides. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he had notified several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his choices ahead of time, but <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, a member of the committee that will hold confirmation hearings on <LOCATION> Shepherd </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, pointedly stated that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had not advised him in advance. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned out of concern that the nearly 11-month criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> was hurting the department's operations and image. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s second choice to replace <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, after former federal appeals judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> turned it down, citing a heavy private caseload. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, would fill the post vacated by Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, who is leaving the department to become a federal appeals court judge. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Shepherd </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, `` From what I now know about these two fine individuals, I look forward to supporting their confirmation.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he probably will announce a recommended replacement for <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> after returning from a week-long trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to discuss drugs with officials in several countries. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON>, now an assistant secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, had rejected a request from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to take <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s job, assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON> decided not to take the job `` because of the taint factor'' relating to the continuing criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined to say whether he had offered Martoche the job, but said he had spoken to a number of people about it. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was asked whether he had had second thoughts about accepting his appointment. `` Certainly the events of last week made me, as a professional, pause,'' he said. `` But I have every confidence in the leadership of the department and the attorney general. I think with our new team here the operation of the department will continue.'' <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said he had no reservations about taking the job in the wake of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' protest resignation. But <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> did acknowledge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continuing legal problems, saying `` we all see that.'' The White House allowed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to proceed with the replacements, despite a lack of completed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students missing for four days may be on a secret honeymoon, say authorities, who are appealing to the newlyweds to confirm their safety with a call to their parents. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, of the west <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Elgin </PERSON>, who were married secretly March 23, disappeared Saturday.

<HEAD>Oversight Panel Says Doctors' Dissent Must Stop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dispute between transplant specialists and anesthesiologists at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> has resulted in boycotts of meetings and other conflicts, says an official of a transplant oversight committee. The Very Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, vice chairman of the committee, said Tuesday that the panel probably will discuss the controversy at its April 14 meeting. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> began investigating dissension at the hospital after several internal memos criticizing its liver transplant program were disclosed late last month. The memos were released by <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> woman who is being sued by the hospital for not paying her late son's medical bills. `` It is obvious that an institution which has internal memos getting out on the street and personality clashes being made public needs to look at its administration,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said she released the memos in hopes of spurring a federal investigation of the hospital's liver transplant program. Her 7-year-old son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, died last year after three liver transplants. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has refused to pay the $ 261,189 still owed the hospital, saying her son received negligent care. The boy's plight generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from sympathetic Americans, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials are investigating Ms. DeSillers' handling of the money. The memos, some of which were written by Dr. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, an anesthesiologist, spoke of confusion in the hospital's liver transplant program. He also referred to `` growing distrust, disillusionment and negativism.'' `` Recently, we had two current transplants in which the donor organs were switched about like peas under shells until no one could easily recall which liver was to go into which patient,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> wrote in a Feb. 2 letter to Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, the hospital's medical director. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said both patients are doing well. `` Dr. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> is using exciting language, but he really did n't look at the results,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` It seems that whoever moved on this case did a good job.'' Mortality rates for pediatric liver transplants are excellent, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. As of two weeks ago, 44 of 49 patients operated on since August have survived, he said. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said, however, that the transplant surgeons who work under the direction of transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> occasionally act like `` cowboys'' in the hospital bureaucracy. The surgeons sometimes ignore surgical schedules and expect anesthesiologists to show up on short notice, he said. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> chided the anesthesiologists for not attending the weekly liver transplant reviews, when hospital staff members assign priorities to the list of patients awaiting transplants. `` There did n't seem to be a chain of command so that the anesthesiologists and transplant surgeons knew what was happening with the scheduling and with the reviews,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` What needs to be emphasized here is that this is a good program, and what Dr. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> will tell you, I'm sure, is that he wants to make a good program better,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said.

 The government today told international relief agencies to recall all their foreign workers from the war-torn northern regions of <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> for security reasons, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. The request was made in a two-page statement distributed to relief agencies in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the capital, by the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency responsible for drought and famine relief in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> RRC </ORGANIZATION> notified relief agencies operating to recall to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> their expatriate staff to avoid personnel security risks,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` Donor agencies are advised to turn over their operations to the <ORGANIZATION> RRC </ORGANIZATION> to guarantee the continuity of relief activities.'' The order comes a week after President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> told Ethiopians in a radio address that government troops were facing a `` grim struggle'' against rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the long-time rebellions and appealed to his countrymen to give `` everything to the warfront.'' Rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war, and for 14 years in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> The fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said the statement did not give a deadline for withdrawal of foreigners from the northern regions and the order did not apply to Ethiopians working with the international agencies. The number of foreign relief workers affected by the order was not immediately known. There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but only a few operate in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>.

 A woman who pleaded guilty to shooting her former psychologist and two members of his family was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay her victims $ 10,000. `` You I believe are a dangerous person who should be locked up... for as long as you remain a threat,'' <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracyalny </PERSON> in sentencing her Tuesday She will be eligible for parole in 10 to 11 years, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsumoto </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Gracyalny </PERSON> wounded neuropsychology specialist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, his wife and daughter Dec. 20 as they returned to their home in the <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> area about 10 miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She hid in the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> family's front yard and opened fire with a handgun, chasing them around the house to the back yard before the couple was able to subdue her, authorities said. During the attack, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 34, was shot in the arm, his wife <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, 31, was shot in both legs and their 6-year-old daughter was shot in the left leg. The couple's three sons, ages 9, 11 and 18 months, were uninjured. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> asked that Ms. <PERSON> Gracyalny </PERSON> be given the maximum sentence. `` My wife has five bullet holes in her leg,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> told the judge. His 7-year-old daughter has a bullet lodged in her leg which can not be removed, and he has suffered nerve damage to one hand, he said. `` The situation that my family and I have endured has gone beyond that of vandalism and harassment. It can only be compared to being held hostage in your own home,'' he said. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, 11, also asked that Ms. <PERSON> Gracyalny </PERSON> receive the maximum term. `` We have been afraid to play in our own yard due to the presence of Miss Gracyalny. We have also been afraid to walk to our schools and synagogue,'' he said. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> treated Ms. <PERSON> Gracyalny </PERSON> between November 1982 and March 1983 for an undisclosed problem. The patient began harassing the therapist soon afterward, according to court records.

 A potential juror in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said she thought the press picked on his family during the 1984 vice presidential candidacy of his mother, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. The woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking questioning of 25 people during jury selection, which resumed this morning for a third day. Opening arguments were expected later today or Thursday. Twelve jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said the selection of a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> is so well-known. `` Selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the case,'' he said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said if even one juror bore a grudge, it could influence the jury's verdict. Most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts of the case since <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was charged in 1986 with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. One potential juror said today that he would discount anything he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the press. `` They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because they have been charged,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON>. Only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the prominence of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s mother could affect his view of the case. Jury pool member <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillo </PERSON> said Tuesday that she felt that press treatment of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> during the 1984 campaign carried over to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>. `` I ca n't say I do n't feel the press picked on these people,'' <PERSON> Cillo </PERSON> said when asked if she was pleased with how <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> has been treated. She said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case. `` The press is not trying this case,'' she said. `` The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?'' `` I do n't believe it's up to me to make restitution for what the press may or may not have done,'' she added. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, then a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded innocent to the charge. He has been accompanied to court each day by his mother and father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> Sr.. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers, taking notes intently, but stopping when <PERSON> Cillo </PERSON> spoke about her family At that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down. She later declined to comment on the case, telling one reporter, `` It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering anything for anybody.'' The start of Monday's trial came two years after her son was arrested outside the <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> restaurant where he worked. Six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning, which was briefly interrupted Monday when Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> imposed and then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection. Defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters could intimidate potential jurors. But <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> lifted it following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit their number in the courtroom. The case has wound its way slowly through the courts. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed unsuccessfully that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was singled out for prosecution because of his mother The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to dismiss the case.

But when political friends urge him to leave, he ought to pay attention. Unfortunately, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> insists on hanging on to his job by his fingernails, despite well-intentioned advice by respected associates that he no longer can fulfill his important duties. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the Artful Dodger of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has had a special prosecutor on his tail for much of the four years he has been the nation's highest law enforcement officer. That does n't seem untoward to him, but it does to many of us We know a defendant must be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But the attorney general should be presumed honorable, clean and competent, which his top aides at Justice decline to do. Time to go, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>.

 April 2 <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> -LRB- Ind. -RRB- Courier on privatization of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service: In a report more likely to gather dust than to trigger immediate action, a presidential commission has come up with an intelligent plan for privatizing the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service. Opponents of privatization point out that the existing government monopoly subsidizies the extra costs of rural mail delivery with revenues from urban and suburban delivery. They predict that if private delivery companies were allowed to enter the market, they would concentrate only on high-volume, low-cost areas and leave the Feds stuck with the unprofitable rural routes. The commission's response: Start by allowing free competition only in rural delivery. If private companies succeed in serving rural households at prices no higher than those of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, `` this strategy could go a long way toward calming the fears of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that postal privatization would leave them underserved.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor should see to it that the experiment gets a chance.

 April 1 <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on the Contra aid package: Central Americans must already understand that the $ 48 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package for the Contras and other programs in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was motivated more by partisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics than by any deep and abiding concern for the plight of the Central Americans. Both Republicans and Democrats wanted a `` defensible'' record as they face elections this year so that they would not be exposed to charges that they surrendered <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the communists or prolonged a senseless war. But there is value in the package. The $ 17.7 million that will move in monthly installments to the Contras will provide only food, cloporarily the question of a Jackson ticket in the fall. `` Not relief,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> replied. `` I was impressed with the results of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had shown `` toughness to stick to the issues.'' `` The people looked at us and made a decision as to who they thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead this country ... Fortunately, I was on top,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` I hope I can do the same in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I believe I can and go on and win the nomination.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who appeared on `` CBS This Morning,'' congratulated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for running `` a good, effective campaign'' in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but noted his own strong showings to date. `` Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or No. 2 in 30 of them and I have 250,000-plus popular vote lead and so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contest puts the spotlight on Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked convention. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' win is likely to tone down talk of drafting <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> or another Democrat. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor has not made an endorsement, but the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp is hoping the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> win could put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor. There was a Republican primary in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but there were no doubts. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the nomination his in everything but name, bested <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> by a 10-1 margin. In the Democratic battle, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the boost he had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. `` I hope it's a sign of things to come,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of what he called `` a great victory.'' With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 481,857 or 48 percent, to 285,575 or 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 176,009 for 17 pecent, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> drew only 48,877 about 5 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> edged <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among blue-collar workers, network exit polls said, and won white union workers outright. That was good news for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who needed to show he can win that group, which is key to the party's hopes in the fall. Even in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, home of the doomed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plant where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had made a splash by joining the picket line, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won with better than a 2-1 margin. `` I'm doing very well with working families ... because people see in me someone who does n't just talk about jobs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also won in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses, which were held Monday, even though the counting dragged into Tuesday. With 77 percent counted, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won with 44 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 37 percent. Uncommitted groups took 16 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 3 percent. In the Republican caucuses in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won easily over <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s campaign was in serious trouble after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stunning victory in the March 26 caucuses But he has now won three of four events in the past eight days _ adding <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> caucuses over the weekend. `` This is going to be a 15-round bout and it will be by a decision ... there's no such thing as a knockout punch,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The delegate numbers showed why the Democratic race could continue to drag on. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved ahead, but the party's rules splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> close. Despite his victory margin, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up on 43 delegates in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to 26 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won 12. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up 21 national convention delegates and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 17. The other seven are uncommitted. That, plus partial <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> results, left the AP delegate count this way: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 735.55; <PERSON> Jacksn </PERSON>, 706.55; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 394.8; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 170.5; and uncommitted 516.6. A total of 2,082 votes are need to win at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Tuesday's results give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the momentum going into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single state thus far. Then comes the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, where the rules could allow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win the lion's share of the delegates, on April 26. Perhaps equally important, his victories this week give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> new, stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. With the pledged delegate count still close, the verdict of the unpledged super delegates _ governors, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ could provide the numbers to give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a majority. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vowed to press on. `` I'm a long distance runner,'' he said.

 Masked Arabs wielding grenades and pistols and demanding freedom for pro-Iranian terrorists in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> today called a doctor aboard a hijacked jet to treat two women believed to be members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. The physician, identified only as Dr. <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, was quoted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as describing the condition of one of the women as `` not satisfactory.'' The hijackers reportedly said some passengers were `` unwell.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media reported the five or six Arabic-speaking hijackers said Tuesday that three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> family on the jet would be in `` imminent danger'' unless <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> freed 17 convicted pro-Iranian extremists in 12 hours. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected the demand. The deadline passed at 10 a.m. -LRB- 2:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-, according to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. The hijackers then contacted the <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> tower in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` to remind that the respite is nearing the end,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The doctor did not identify the women he treated or say what was wrong with them. He said he asked the hijackers to let the womem leave the plane, but they refused, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. According to a passenger list from the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, they were the only women among the 87 hostages remaining after the release today of 24 female passengers and flight attendants. The Kuwaiti Cabinet called the hijackers' demands `` blackmail,'' and it sent a team to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to negotiate with the hijackers after meeting in emergency session under Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. The team, made up of an unspecified number of foreign ministry officials and some physicians, arrived in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> this afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it believed there were no Americans aboard the jet, which was commandeered Tuesday en route to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and forced to land in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The hijackers have threatened to blow up the plane. One man still aboard the plane has a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and an Egyptian passport. Twelve Britons were still on board. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> stood by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s refusal not to yield to the hijackers' demands. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` We do not give in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.'' Austrian radio reported that some of the passengers on the plane had their hands bound. Two Austrians who work for the computer giant <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were among the hostages. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> sent one of the three diplomats at its <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> embassy to help in negotiations with the hijackers. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, Austrian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greinert </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had informed <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> that the `` passengers are doing well under the circumstances.'' According to the passenger list, the two women from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family are <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> A male member of the royal family on the jet was identified as <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> sources who demanded anonymity said <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> is a businessman and distant relative of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the target of an assassination attempt by pro-Iranian extremists in 1986. The women were identified as <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON>'s sisters. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that in their last contact with the control tower today, the hijackers asked for breakfast, oxygen, a doctor, and a generator to keep the air conditioning working. It quoted them as telling the airport tower that `` some of the passengers are feeling unwell.'' The hijackers also said they did not believe `` negotiations between them and Iranian negotiators at the aiport here would prove useful,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. They repeated a threat to force the plane to take off for an unspecified destination. There have been conflicting reports in the Iranian media over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has been refueled since it landed Tuesday. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> not to allow the jetliner to take off. The Iranians said the plane will have to leave if the crisis is not resolved soon but surrounded it to keep it from taking off, Iranian media said. The hijackers freed 24 women after negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Deputy Prime Minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayyeri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media said Another passenger, a Jordanian with a heart condition, was freed Tuesday. The nationalities of the hijackers were not disclosed, but their demand echoed that of Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems holding American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 militants convicted in the December 1983 bombings of the French and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies and other targets in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has been a target of Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> terrorists for years and has jailed scores for sabotage and bombings since 1983. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of masterminding the hijacking. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying the hijackers were Iranian agents. Among the 97 passengers and 15 crew aboard the plane when it was seized were 30 Kuwaitis, 22 Britons, eight Thais and a person with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and an Egyptian passport identified only as <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Attiaallaali </PERSON>, according to the passenger list. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> identified the released women, who included five flight attendants, as 10 Britons, three Thais, three Egyptians, a Filipina, a Palestinian, a Singaporean, an Irishwoman, a German, an Austrian, a Syrian and a Pakistani. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` We do not give in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.'' `` It does seem as if the hijackers have some humane feelings after all,'' said the mother of 25-year-old <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, a Briton on the plane who apparently was among the women set free. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she was still waiting for news of her son <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, 23, who boarded the flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> with his sister.

 The fine for parking illegally in problem traffic areas of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> may leap from $ 40 to $ 100, city officials said. The higher fines would be for illegally parking at fire hydrants, expired meters, in no-parking and no-standing zones, and for blocking driveways in the most congested areas. In addition, the city wants to boost the towing fee from $ 100 to $ 125. `` In a way we're competing with garages,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, first deputy transportation commissioner. `` Garage fees are so high that people think it's cheaper to park illegally. The $ 100 parking ticket will change that.'' The new fines require the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which has a $ 50 cap for the fees municipalities can charge for illegal parking. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said passage is expected.

 Nearly 80 percent of the convicts entering state prisons are involved with drugs, according to an internal study for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles. The study, which found the typical inmate is an unemployed high school dropout with a drug or alcohol problem, concludes that crime in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will get worse if the state builds new prisons at the expense of education and social programs. The study of 1,483 offenders admitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> in one month late last year found that four-fifths of them _ whether they were entering prison as a result of a court sentence, probation violation or parole revocation _ had used drugs, were under the influence of drugs when they were arrested or were convicted of a drug-related offense. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> expenditures for substance abuse are so minimal that there are practically no resources available,'' said parole board researcher <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, noting that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranks near the bottom of the 50 states in funding for drug and alcohol programs.

<TEXT>
 The city has gotten tentative approval to buy homes repossessed for unpaid government mortgages and sell them for $ 1 to poor families chosen through a raffle, officials said. `` There are going to be some mighty lucky people out there'' if the program wins full approval, said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, local urban homesteading coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The city had asked for $ 600,000 to buy homes in three neighborhoods, but the amount is likely to be less, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said Tuesday. The application has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, but the contract agreement between the city and the federal government has yet to be drawn up. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> agrees with the plan in principle,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. `` I just doubt that it will come out with full funding the first time around.'' Under the homesteading program, the buyers must repair, maintain and occupy the homes for a minimum of five consecutive years. <PERSON> Margi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gant </PERSON>, the city's <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> coordinator, said that if $ 600,000 is approved, 24 homes could be bought at the $ 25,000 maximum allowed. The development office should receive a contract from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> later this month, officials said. To get in the lottery, home seekers will have to show they qualify for a government loan or can do repairs to ensure the home is rehabilitated. Once the work is complete, the deed to the home will be sold to the purchaser for $ 1. The houses repossessed will be those foreclosed on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loans.

<TEXT>
 A Colombian cocaine ring made such enormous profits that it created its own courier service to move the cash, a convicted money launderer told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. `` Basically, there is no effective interdiction for money,'' <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Milian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee. `` The problem the launderer faces is security, not an authority per se.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a Cuban-born accountant, is serving a 43-year prison term for money laundering. He has admitted serving as a chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money launderer for the <PERSON> Medillin </PERSON> cartel, the drug ring named after the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city where it is based. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he was handling up to $ 2 billion a year for the cartel. He showed the subcomittee boxes he said were used by the cartel for shipping cash. They were inscribed with the name `` Consolidated Courier Services.'' The boxes were designed specifically to carry the cash and were loaded onto pallets to be lifted aboard airplanes and flown from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told the subcommittee. His testimony came a day after the committee was told that a top Haitian military officer offered to sell high-quality cocaine for shipment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, flying the drugs from a lighted, 8,400-foot private airstrip at his ranch. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> described the lavish lifestyle of Haitian Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the influence <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wielded and the fear he evoked in Haitian citizens with whom he came in contact. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said the cocaine deal was discussed at the Dessaline Barracks in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, headquarters of an elite military unit <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> commands. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is under indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring to import cocaine but apparently is out of the reach of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities because he can not be extradited. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s life has been threatened by Haitian drug figures and he is under protection by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He testified Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee, which is holding a series of hearings on the drug trade in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The panel planned to call other witnesses today to describe money laundering and to spell out how the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> used at least one alleged drug trafficker to ferry supplies to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In federal court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the committee obtained limited immunity from prosecution for future testimony from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who faces drug charges in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, as an official of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> aircraft leasing firm Vortex, had a contract in early 1986 with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which funneled humanitarian aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, another witness before the panel on Tuesday who now is serving a 12 -LCB- - year sentence on marijuana charges, said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> had been arrested along with himself on identical charges, but was dropped from the indictment in March of 1986 while under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` It is unusual. It is strange,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. He acknowledged he once had felt bitterness about what he saw as <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s preferential treatment, but said he now was more concerned about the corrupting influence of drugs. `` You ca n't use drug smugglers for other tasks by the government,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, told the panel he had run an honest seafood brokerage enterprise until he was approached in 1986 by <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Merielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s wife, about a seafood deal. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> at first offered to sell seafood at below market prices, and asked a $ 1-a-pound commission, he said. But the deal later turned into a drug transaction, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> arranged for 412 kilos of cocaine to be flown from a grass airstrip on his ranch 90 miles from the Haitian capital, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> and an associate told <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> they needed a sample of the cocaine, which tested at about 90 percent pure, to take back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the colonel personally carried it past customs officials in his holster for them, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was able to identify <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in his country because he had a contact inside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, he said. But a pilot hired to carry the drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> landed in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and stole them, he told the subcommittee. As guarantor of the $ 4 million deal, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was threatened by Haitians who had provided the drugs. When he tried to get them back, he walked into a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> sting operation and was arrested, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was later sent out by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to make further contacts with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as an undercover operative, and it was his testimony which enabled the indictment to be obtained.

<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in the streets of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the second day of a battle for supremacy in which police say 12 people have been killed and 34 wounded. A police spokesman said the mainstream Amal militia used armored vehicles, artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades against the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in 14 towns and villages. Amal is led by <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> justice minister, and has Syrian support. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Militia officers also `` toured the south in loudspeaker vans blaring warnings to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters to surrender their weapons and avert the bloodshed,'' the police spokesman said. He quoted Amal as telling <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen: `` Our main aim is security and stability for the south. Whoever surrenders his weapon will live in peace.'' Fear was expressed in many circles that the war for supremacy in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> region would spread to the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been ravaged by civil war for 13 years. This led the nation's most leading Shiite cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, to order an end to the battle. `` We prohibit this fighting because it burns <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s causes and the Moslems,'' he said in a fatwa, or religious ruling. Despite <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s declaration, <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighting raged all day from <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, an inland market town, to the ancient port of Tyre. The police spokesman, whose name was withheld in accordance with regulations, gave this account: Amal forces with armored personnel carriers and 106mm recoilless artillery advanced across <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>'s main street to the town's old sector, where <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters were installed in sniping nests. `` The fighting in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> is ferocious. Rescue teams have not been able to evacuate casualties in some parts of the town. <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> citizens have been hiding in basements and bomb shelters since Tuesday.'' About 50 women and old men ventured out in a relatively quiet neighborhood `` chanting slogans demanding an end to the fighting'' but `` dashed for cover again when two mortar rounds slammed into the neighborhood.'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s militiamen stormed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions in the village of <LOCATION> Siddiqine </LOCATION>, eight miles southeast of Tyre, before dawn. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters sought refugee at Siddiqine's Iranian-financed Shiite religious school, the main base of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Moneem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhanna </PERSON>, said to be a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader in the Tyre region `` Amal militiamen surrounded <PERSON> Mhanna </PERSON>'s school and are calling on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters to surrender.'' All Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are on `` full alert. Each side has erected checkpoints in its areas of influence to prevent the other from reinforcing its positions.'' Fighting began Tuesday when <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen attacked an Amal checkpoint near <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, killing an Amal militiaman and wounding four others. The police spokesman said the attack followed Amal raids on houses in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> and surrounding villages in which 10 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members were captured. He said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> was searching for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members suspected of opening fire Monday on the car of the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Faqih </PERSON>, who was not in the vehicle. Relations between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have deteriorated since Feb. 17 when Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who commands the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observer unit, was kidnapped near Tyre. Amal rounded up dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members it accused of involvement. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has denied involvement in the abduction of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> was `` harassing the believers by searching for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy.'' A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a pro-Iranian underground group believed affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, has claimed responsibility for abducting <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is thought to be an umbrella group for pro-Iranian underground factions holding most of the 22 foreigners missing and presumably kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, abducted March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra case today ruled he needed more time to study independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan to prevent unauthorized disclosure of 150,000 pages of classified documents. In a brief opinion, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s motion for expedited consideration of the proposed protective order, saying it `` appears to be far too complex, lacks definite time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair and expeditious disposition of this case.'' But the judge said he wants to set an April deadline for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s review of the classified material and fix a time for the defense to notify the court whether it intends to use any of the secret documents as evidence <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would hear further argument at next Tuesday's hearing on `` the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a realistic trial date. The documents, which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says `` describe in detail some of the nation's most carefully held secrets about its foreign policy, its intelligence activities and its covert activities,'' must be turned over to the defense as part of pre-trial discovery. Some of the documents from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies may be introduced as evidence after they are declassified or secret material is deleted. Lawyers for former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> had filed a motion opposing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan to require them and their clients to obtain security clearances to examine the material. The four are accused of conspiracy to defraud the government by diverting arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had sought expedited consideration of his plan by the judge. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said: `` It will be necessary to frame a more limited protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.'' The proposal includes setting up a `` secure compartmented information facility'' where the defense lawyers would be required to work with the documents and compose any pleadings that quote the material. Without such procedures, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, he can not begin turning over the material to the defense for pre-trial discovery. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had also asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to establish intricate procedures under the Classified Information Procedures Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- for court review of classified documents to determine how such information could be disclosed in court. The act empowers a trial judge to delete classified portions of a document if it is irrelevent to the case or to substitute a statement of facts that secret material would prove if shown to a jury. In a joint pleading filed Tuesday, defense lawyers opposed <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s motion because it raised questions about `` the constitutionality -LRB- as well as the statutory propriety -RRB- of various aspects of the proposed order even if the <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> itself is constitutional.'' The defense said it wants more time to file briefs on a number of issues it contends are raised by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal. The defense contends that the proposed order would impose `` improper and questionable'' conditions on the defense lawyers and their clients. The defense noted that the order would apply to classified information that had already been known to the defendants, particularly North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The attorneys also questioned whether <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, as an independent counsel, has the proper authority to enforce the Classified Information Procedures Act. The defense said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request raises `` questions whether the president's foreign affairs and national security responsibilities can be delegated to an official such as Mr. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>.'' In reply, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the defense was attempting `` to invent substantive isues concerning the proposed protective order where none exists.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> labeled `` transparent'' the defense objection to applying the restrictions to North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` Classified information does not become declassified because a criminal defendant knew it before he was indicted; if that were the case, there would have been no need for the <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> in the many espionage trials where the statute has been used extensively,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old Israeli girl and two Palestinians were shot to death in a clash today between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians and Arabs in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, the army said. It said 15 Israelis, including a soldier, were wounded. The Israeli girl was the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian to die in four months of unrest in the occupied territories. There were conflicting reports on what led to the violence in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Palestinians who said they witnessed the clash from a half-mile away said about 30 Israeli settlers entered the village on foot and fired without provocation, killing one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>. Angry villagers then charged the settlers, the Palestinians said. `` The first man who was killed, <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseh </PERSON>, was plowing his land,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseh </PERSON> was 20. `` When they heard a farmer was killed, they attacked the settlers with axes, picks and rocks. There was hand-to-hand fighting,'' said <PERSON> Aly </PERSON>, who was interviewed at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabr </PERSON>, 22, was killed when he ran toward the settlers brandishing a stick. The army and Israeli witnesses said the violence began when Palestinians stoned a group of Israeli teen-agers on a Passover bus and hiking tour of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. An army statement said two security guards on the bus opened fire at the stone-throwers, killing two Arabs and wounding two others. During the clash, the army said <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> grabbed an M-16 automatic rifle and an Uzi submachine gun from the guards and opened fire on the Israelis, killing the girl and wounding three other Israelis. Boleslav Godlman, administrator of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said an adult and nine children ages 14 and 15 suffered minor injuries. He said most of the 10 were hit by stones and metal fragments. Most of the injured reportedly were teen-agers from the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Elon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moreh </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. A soldier was injured in the head by a rock and was in serious condition in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Haddassah hospital, the army said. Another Israeli teen-ager was found slightly wounded in a villager's home. The army said the 17-year-old girl, whose name was not made public immediately, was killed by a bullet. It gave no details on how the other Israeli civilians were wounded. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 15, from <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said 18 teen-agers, a soldier and a guide had left the bus and were sitting in a dry river bed when a group of Arabs began throwing stones at them. The Israelis got up and left `` and soon we discovered we were being followed by dozens of Arabs,'' <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said from his Haddassah Hospital bed. <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> had a bandage on his right arm and the right side of his chest but said he did not know if he was hit by rocks or by bullets. He said some of the Arabs following the Israelis apparently wanted to help them and said `` come fast we'll lead you out of here.'' The Arabs led them a short distance to <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>. There, <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said, `` a woman came with a huge stone, and she threw it at the head of the soldier.'' He said the guide who was armed opened fire on the Arabs. <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Bron </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, said teen-agers at the bus radioed for help, and troops arrived and sealed the area, he said. The deaths brought to 140 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis since unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. One Israeli soldier has been killed. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON>, a settler leader in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said the attack on civilians could prompt some of the 65,000 Israelis living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to take vigilante action. `` This is a most serious confrontation. If this time the situation is not brought under control, I think it will be impossible to stop every Jew from taking things into his own hands,'' <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawari </PERSON>, the Arab head of the Israeli-appointed village council of <LOCATION> Hawara </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> had been declared `` liberated'' from Israeli rule and was bedecked with the outlawed Palestinian flag. Arab witnesses said the clash lasted about 1 -LCB- hours, until soldiers arrived. The entrance to the village was blocked by seven army jeeps by afternoon, and an army helicopter hovered overhead. The army said a curfew was imposed on the area, confining the village's 12,000 residents to their homes. The army said it was searching for the Arab attackers.

 It may seem as if a new set of golden arches is springing up every day, but the McDonald's fast-food restaurant that opened for business Wednesday was special. It was No. 10,000. The corporation known for reciting numbers as if they had mystical properties _ more than 65 billion hamburgers served _ dispatched about 20,000 balloons skyward at the opening in <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and another 10,000 exactly at the <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where it was holding its biannual convention for franchisees and partners, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starmann </PERSON>, senior vice president. `` It's almost 33 years to the day when <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> opened his first McDonald's,'' said the corporation's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> were here, he would be fiercely proud of the McDonald's family.'' The fast-food chain branched into Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on March 24 when it opened a restaurant in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, and plans to open another one in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in May. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will thus become the 50th country around the world to have a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 10,000 restaurants, 75 percent are locally operated by independent entrepreneurs. Others are joint-venture partnerships and some wholly owned subsidiaries, <PERSON> Starmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> opened the first <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant on April 15, 1955, in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, Ill. Sales on that rainy day, according to a statement from the company, were $ 366.12. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide sales were $ 14.3 billion and it served 22 million customers in 49 countries. It passed the mark of 60 billion hamburgers served in November 1986.

<TEXT>
 Officials investigating the hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet that departed from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> were told Wednesday that four passengers may have boarded with forged Bahraini passports. A senior member of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> police force who asked not to be identified told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Bahraini officials had contacted the Thais concerning the possible fogery. The identities of the four have not been released. The Thai government has made virtually no statements on the hijack of Flight 422, which was commandeered Tuesday while en route from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and it appeared to be trying to keep the investigation on a low key, possibly to avoid embarrassment should a security flaw at the airport be discovered. <PERSON> Vidhya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayanonda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told reporters he did not think <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s image would be damaged because `` hijacks occur everywhere.'' <PERSON> Vidhya </PERSON> said security at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s Don Muang International Airport was adequate and he raised the possibility that the weapons used by the hijackers might have been put on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The airliner flew into <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Monday and was on the ground for about 15 hours before taking off for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. One passenger was quoted by Iranian media as saying the hijackers were armed with pistols and hand grenades. `` We still do n't know where the weapons came from or how they got there -LRB- on the plane -RRB- in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Charoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peetong </PERSON>, the general manager of the airport. `` But we are looking for serious answers to our questions, though answers will more likely be found in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the northeastern Iranian city where the plane was diverted. <PERSON> Charoon </PERSON> said authorities were double-checking all personnel who were near the jumbo jet before take-off Tuesday, including the airline's caterer, ground mechanics and those who refueled the aircraft, he said. There have been no known major complaints from foreign governments or international agencies about security at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport. Passengers and carry-on luggage are searched by electronic devices.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> may be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in 59 years to have lost his job through impeachment conviction, but he is n't ready to say he's giving up politics. Interviewed this morning on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said that he'd `` definitely run in it -LRB- a recall election -RRB- unless they get it so tied up in legal technicalities. I can win the re-election, win the recall election, I think.'' Acting Secretary of State <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>'s office said today that she had ordered <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s name removed from the recall ballot pending a resolution of legal issues. The attorney general's office said that because <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was placed on the ballot through his status as governor, and not by gathering petitions as the other candidates did, he is no longer entitled to be on it. Earlier, the ousted <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor told a Kiwanis club, `` This is just another chapter in a book, and this book is n't near the end.'' `` I have n't yet determined what my course will be,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told the group Tuesday, one day after he was ousted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have n't yet said that I'm not going to be a candidate in the recall -LRB- on May 17 -RRB-. I'm not even sure that I choose to be in.'' As <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s replacement, former Secretary of State Rose Mofford, was sworn in Tuesday, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would decide within a week whether the recall election must still be held. Concerned <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Mecham group, has dropped its opposition to the election because it now sees the recall as the former governor's last hope for regaining his office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who described himself as the `` recent former governor,'' appeared relaxed Tuesday. `` I have no rancor in my heart for anybody,'' he said. However, he warned that those who ousted him may not realize they have `` awakened a sleeping giant'' in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> electorate. `` I know that they are aroused, I know that they are incensed, I know that they are right-down angry,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. He jokingly referred to the Kiwanis group as the `` round-eyes club,'' recalling the day several months ago when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was severely criticized for telling the same group that when a group of Japanese people were told about <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s golf courses, `` suddenly they got round eyes.'' Recalling his remark, the former governor said, `` That's an in-house joke between me and this club and, let's see, about half the world, I think.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who also provoked criticism for comments that were perceived as slurs against blacks, homosexuals and Jews, became the first governor to be removed from office in 59 years on Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of obstructing justice and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund. Several weeks ago, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him, he might go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to claim that his rights had been violated. He said Tuesday he had not decided whether he will do so. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. If convicted, he would be barred from holding office again. But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said today he was confident that if justice prevails, he will be found innocent. `` If we can get a fair jury, we should get acquitted quite easily,'' he said on `` Good Morning America.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>'s only opera, `` Europeras 1 & amp; 2,'' will have its American premiere this summer at the PepsiCo Summerfare program. One hundred forty artists plus technicians are required to put on the opera, which will be staged in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, north of the city. Cage derived conducting, costume choices, stage movement and some of the music by consulting the ancient Chinese fortune-telling I Ching, much as he does when composing for dance. A computer program that adds time to spatial dimensions helped as well.

 A railroad worker was killed and two others injured when two empty commuter trains collided this morning, halting all service on <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>'s New Haven line at the height of the rush hour, authorities said. An eight-car train moving at full speed crashed into the rear of a five-car train halted by a problem with overhead electrical wires about one mile west of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> station just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. The dead worker, who was not identified, was believed to be the engineer of the second train, authorities said. His body was trapped inside the motorman's compartment of the lead car, which was catapulted into overhead electrical wires on impact and came to rest atop the last car of the other train. Three of the remaining cars of the second train were derailed and at least 100 feet of track was ripped from the ground. Windows, train seats, wires and torn metal was scattered for 300 feet along the tracks. The railroad could not say when service would resume on the line, which spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> said serves 28,900 commuters each morning. The two injured workers were listed in good condition in hospital. Train conductor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Paturzo </PERSON>, 58, suffered bruises and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanacore </PERSON>, 34, had a broken leg. Four other workers on the trains were uninjured and were being interviewed by investigators trying to determine the cause of the accident, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>USDA Quarantines Bees and Equipment in 13 States Hit With Killer

 A federal quarantine to help prevent the spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bee industry has been ordered for 13 states where the pest has been detected so far, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The restrictions, effective immediately, ban the shipment from those states of bees and apiary equipment, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, acting associate administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. States affected by the quarantine are: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Of the major honey producing states, only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> so far remain unaffected by the mites, whose scientific name is Varroa jacobsoni. The female is about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and the male is somewhat smaller. The mites were first discovered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last September in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> apiary and since have spread to the 12 other states. `` Varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees, package bees, hives, pollen, honeycomb with brood cells, and apiary equipment and vehicles,'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. `` Under our regulations, these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met.'' If agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites, they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out of the quarantined states, he said. In other cases, a `` limited permit'' may be issued to move articles that not pose a pest risk, provided that additional precautions are taken. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the quarantine order `` will help protect our beekeeping industry as well as the estimated $ 20 billion worth of agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year.'' The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their developing larvae, or brood, <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. The pests cause decreased brood, deformed bees and weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the mites may go unnoticed until serious damage is done.

<HEAD>Judge Orders DeSillers To Return Attorney Fees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered a woman to return $ 25,000 she paid her lawyers from money donated for her 7-year-old son's liver transplants. `` The withdrawal was an illegal and unlawful act,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said Tuesday during a hearing on the action by <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. `` She must return that sum to the -LRB- <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s -RRB- estate, which subsequently, and ironically, she could very well become heir to.'' <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died April 29 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. His plight moved hundreds of people, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to donate more than $ 670,000 for his operations. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> paid $ 25,000 to the father-and-son law office of <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, who argued Tuesday that she was entitled to use the money. `` DeSillers was a woman alone in the world,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. `` All she knew -LRB- was -RRB- that she was being attacked from all sides when she went to hire an attorney.'' During the hearing, trust curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> claimed that the law office had violated state probate and banking laws by accepting the money. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> was appointed trust curator last month to oversee the $ 239,287 that remains in <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s trust accounts. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said he will continue representing Ms. DeSillers regardless of her financial troubles. Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> is suing Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> for $ 262,000, what it claims is the unpaid portion of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s $ 424,300 medical bill. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has said she refused to pay the balance because of allegedly poor care. She and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> have said they plan to countersue the hospital. The state has filed an administrative complaint against Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> and fined her $ 1,000 for allegedly violating charity laws. The complaint and fine are being appealed. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' use of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s trust also is being investigated by <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. That investigation prompted Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>' appointment.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Wednesday delivered remains said to be those of 27 missing Americans, and it threatened to stop the search if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues accusing it of playing politics with the dead. In a solemn military ceremony, 27 sets of remains were put on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport jet to be flown to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for authentication. It was the largest delivery yet by the Vietnamese. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> also turned over three sets of remains described as those of ethnic Asians who also may be missing Americans from the long war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which ended with a communist victory in April 1975. The large delivery had encouraged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to anticipate more help from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, but senior Vietnamese had sharp comments about allegations that they warehouse remains and return them gradually for political reasons. They also said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should help finance <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s reconstruction if it wants a full accounting of the 1,767 Americans still listed as missing in action Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, who met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, responded `` very angrily'' to a recent <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was returning remains gradually, said an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participant in the talks. `` That is nonsense,'' <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> accounting office, said in an interview Tuesday. `` The next time they make such a statement, we will have to reconsider whether we will do the job. This shows there is no goodwill on the part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Two dozen peasants in conical bamboo hats squatting in an adjacent field watched as the 27 small caskets, each with a folded <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag on top, were placed into the belly of the giant C-141 aircraft at Noi Bai airport. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, joined a military team from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center in saluting the caskets as they passed on the tarmac under overcast skies. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> provided names for at least half the 27 remains, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center. They were not made public. `` This being the largest, we hope it means increased collaboration,'' said Maj. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pribyla </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. She also said, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has more information than it has divulged. It was the fourth return of remains since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed in talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> in August to resume its MIA accounting efforts. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nien </PERSON>, a deputy foreign minister, accompanied it with an accusation Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not met the terms of the agreement because it had given no direct government aid for reconstruction. Since the accord, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has received only two shipments of prosthetic equipment, both from private agencies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials suspect the Vietnamese are trying to move toward normal relations through government-to-government links on the humanitarian aid issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said frequently said it will not establish diplomatic relations or lift its trade embargo until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> makes as full an accounting as possible of the MIAs and leaves <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which it invaded in December 1978. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has sent investigative medical teams to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and encouraged private aid, but has not lifted an embargo on official aid imposed as a protest of the occupation. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has returned 152 remains the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> laboratories have confirmed as those of MIAs. The previous largest transfer was on Aug. 14, 1985, involving 26 sets of remains, at least 24 of which were confirmed.

<TEXT>
 A judge today granted surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> immediate, unsupervised visitation of eight hours a week with the child she agreed to bear under a $ 10,000 contract. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s visits with 2-year-old <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> would be expanded from one eight-hour day weekly to two days every other week in September, overnight visits in April 1989 and two weeks during that summer `` The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by continued and expanded visitation with her mother,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said. His order barred both sides in the case from discussing <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> publicly, such as in the promotion of books or movies. The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> had argued during a three-day visitation hearing last week that Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> would use <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> in a tour to promote a book she is writing about the case. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>'s order does n't not affect publication of Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s book, however, nor does it have any effect on a television movie being made about the case. The judge also ordered the adults in the case to undergo counseling to ease the emotional burden on the child, who lives with her father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, who hired Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> as a surrogate, have custody of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> `` The court finds that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s best interests will be served by unsupervised, uninterrupted liberal visitation with her mother,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said in a written decision given to attorneys. `` She and her mother have the right to develop their own special relationship,'' the judge said. In a statement issued by her attorneys, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> said she was happy her relationship with her daughter `` has been preserved.'' `` I am delighted and grateful to know that as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> grows up, we'll have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each other,'' she said. The Sterns were disappointed by the decision, said their attorney, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, noting that the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> had sought to delay contact between Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> for several years. `` We did not get the hiatus we asked for,'' said <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>. `` They were pleased with the mandatory counseling. And they were pleased with the privacy issue.'' He said the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> would make no public statement on the ruling. <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> had said following the three-day hearing last week that the couple did not plan to appeal <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>'s decision, whatever the outcome. The Sterns argued that visitation should be stopped for at least six years, while Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> sought the gradually expanded, unsupervised visitation she won today. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, an East Brunswick housewife who turns 31 Thursday, was allowed to visit the child for two hours once a week under supervision during the legal battle. She testified during the custody hearing that her daughter would benefit by a `` more natural'' relationship with her mother. The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> said they feared Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> could emotionally harm the child and try to undermine their relationship with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. If there is no appeal, today's ruling would bring to a close a highly publicized, unprecedented court battle that sparked a worldwide debate on parents' rights and reproductive technologies. The dispute began shortly after the child's birth March 31, 1986, when Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, then married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and the mother of two, decided to turn down the $ 10,000 surrogacy fee and refused to hand over the child. No money ever changed hands. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> is now expecting her fourth child by her second husband, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. The Sterns turned to surrogacy because they feared Mrs. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, could develop complications with the disease during pregnancy. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> fled with the baby to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for three months before authorities tracked her down and returned the child to the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, setting the stage for the emotional court battle over custody. After a three-month trial, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkow </PERSON> upheld the surrogate contract and stripped Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> of her parental rights, ordering her never to see the child again. The judge then presided over a speedy adoption of the child by Mrs. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned most of Sorkow's ruling in its landmark Feb. 3 ruling The state's highest court outlawed surrogacy-for-pay and restored Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s parental rights, but upheld custody for the Sterns while ordering the lower court hearing on visitation rights

 An alleged cocaine trafficker wanted for questioning in the slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent was imprisoned today in the maximum-security federal penitentiary at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, authorities said, after being picked up in a pre-dawn helicopter raid at his home in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, 43, was lodged in a cell at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, which the federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals, said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was taken by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals to <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> early today after Honduran police arrested him at his home in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> early Tuesday and put him on a flight headed for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was arrested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals aboard a New York-bound jetliner after being kicked out of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> by officials who had been informed that he was wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities reported. In addition to drug charges, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> wants to question him about the 1985 murder in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. According to one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents have already interviewed <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> briefly since his arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped, tortured and killed in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was one of the four prime suspects in the case. The successful taking into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody of <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was the result of more than a month of sensitive negotiations between Honduran and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source said today. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Safir </PERSON>, the chief of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, spent the last three to six weeks in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> spearheading the effort to get <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> into the hands of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Honduran government sources said that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> met with top civilian and security officials to discuss <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s case According to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement sources, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was taken into custody by <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> police in the airborne helicopter raid on a warrant signed by a city judge. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, said that police and the judge had placed bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they had found it there. She said there had been no drugs at the residence. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s lawyer, said in a telephone interview that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at his client's home at 5:45 a.m. Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was stunned'' by the raid, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source. `` He could n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been living openly in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after escaping in 1986 from a Colombian prison. He had been held in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on charges of involvement with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine-trafficking organization. <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, as a Honduran citizen, could not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` because the constitution forbids it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the expulsion from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> was based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant for <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> after he escaped from <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1971. He was serving a five-year sentence for illegally entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and using a fraudulent visa. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> early today on a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police. He was accompanied by three federal marshals who put him aboard a government jet. Warrants charge <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> with escape from federal custody, conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other crimes. `` This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on illegal drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was believed to have become a leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of illegal drugs from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities link <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to an increase in transshipment of Colombian cocaine through the Central American country. Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduran military officials. The government denied the reports in February. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said critics were trying `` to discredit the armed forces and my government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug traffickers.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in February he makes his living in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $ 2 billion, but he put it at about $ 5 million. He said the charges against him were `` a lie, a story,'' and claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap him. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> said then he never again would leave <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If I appear in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is a kidnapping by American agents. If I am killed, it is the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said at the time.

 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose unorthodox style and ideas made him one of the nation's hot young politicians in the 1970s, celebrates his 50th birthday Thursday the way he has spent most of the last six years _ in private. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has been dropping hints in recent months that he plans a comeback, possibly a race for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1992. But he says the time is not yet right to seek the media spotlight again. Therefore, he vetoed plans by a group of friends and supporters for a birthday celebration this week at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel with 1,000 to 1,500 guests. `` It's just not the right time,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters. `` If I were more active in the public domain, then it might be appropriate.'' Instead, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will celebrate Thursday with what he describes as a small family gathering. Reclusiveness has been <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s way since he lost a race for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> six years ago to Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. He has spent most of the past six years traveling, with especially long stays in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and writing a still-unfinished book. That defeat ended eight years in which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was constantly in the media spotlight with two successful races for governor, two unsuccessful campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> chafed at the constant attention even during the campaign periods when he was working hardest to attract coverage, and he seemed to be genuinely relieved at his close defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. `` The people ... would like a respite from me, and in some ways, I need a respite from them,'' he said in his concession speech. Even in that speech, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he planned to return to political life eventually. In a long interview four months ago, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he still plans to return to politics. He refused to cite a specific race but as he ruled out various options in response to questions, he eliminated nearly everything except running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> if Democrat <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> retires in 1992. On personal subjects, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was as evasive as ever, confirming only that marrying and raising a family `` is on my mind ... but it has n't happened yet.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is spending part of his time practicing what he described as `` business law'' with a large <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm. He declined to discuss that except to say that it involves `` a number of things I've learned in government I can help clients with.''

<HEAD>New Technique Means Instant Breast Replacement for Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new plastic surgery technique which moves fatty tissue from the `` saddle bags'' area of the thigh offers victims of breast cancer another option in reconstruction surgery, says the surgeon who developed it. Medical science may someday eliminate breast cencer, said <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> plastic surgeon. `` But in the meantime, we can take the fear out of the surgery. People wo n't be so terrified. It wo n't be maiming to so many people.'' The procedure developed by <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and his associate Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, has been performed just four times at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> The first was in December. After diseased cancerous tissue is removed, plastic surgeons implant the fatty tissue and the artery that feeds it to replace the lost breast tissue. The surgeons connect the artery and vein in the thigh tissue into an artery and vein in the armpit area. The plastic surgeons use a small piece of skin from the thigh to replace the areola and nipple, which are removed as part of the cancer surgery. When the patient wakes up, she has two breasts, both of which are her own tissue. For years, cancer patients who had to have breasts removed could only wear a padded bra after the surgery. Then doctors developed implants to replace the lost tissue. In the 1980s, a variety of replacement surgeries were developed, using the patient's own tissue from the abdomen or the buttock. `` We went to work in the lab and found this pocket of tissue that is fairly easily removed and has its own blood supply,'' said <PERSON> Beegle </PERSON>. `` It gives the patient another option.'' Today's options for a breast cancer patient include breast removal or, if the cancer is detected very early, the tumors can be removed in a `` lumpectomy'' which is followed by radiation treatment. If the treatment is a mastectomy, removal of the breast and lymph nodes, the patient can select from several forms of reconstruction, including a combination of her own tissue and a small implant, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleb </PERSON>, a former breast cancer surgeon and now chief medical officer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said breast cancer can bring psychological problems. `` The impact of the psychosocial decision is tremendous,'' he said in a telephone interview from his office. The society, he said, has a visitation program in hospitals which assists 70,000 breast cancer patients each year. `` The anxiety varies from woman to woman. The breast is so important to most women,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bostwick </PERSON>, nationally known plastic surgeon from <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's such a shock to a young woman to have a breast cancer, particularly if she is young and healthy, and the treatment is going to do a lot to hurt her feminity,'' he said. `` We find if we can tell them we can do a reconstruction, it helps.'' The replacement with `` saddle bags'' tissue is an easier operation than replacement from the buttocks, <PERSON> Beegle </PERSON> said. `` I think their technique is very innovative for selected women. It's going to be very worthwhile,'' <PERSON> Bostwick </PERSON> said. `` For the woman who does n't have a lot of tissue in the abdomen, it provides another alternative to to find the tissue'' for reconstruction. In one patient, who lost both breasts, `` we used tissue from the abdomen on one side and from the hip on the other,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. `` It allows us to have the luxury of the option.'' Only about 10 percent of 15 percent of the breast cancer patients in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area now seek reconstruction, but the number is increasing, the surgeons said. Early detection of breast cancer, through self-examination and mammograpny has lowered the age of breast cancer patients, they said, meaning the patient is more likely to seek reconstruction. This procedure does n't leave a scar on the abdomen and the incision to remove the thigh tissues is concealed under the buttock so after recovery `` the patient will feel comfortable in shorts, a tennis dress or a bathing suit, the scar wo n't show,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Budapest Launches Strongest Criticism Yet on Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Wednesday launched its strongest criticism yet on communist ally <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> over an ethnic dispute that has clouded relations between the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbors for two years. Two Hungarian newspapers printed editorials fiercely critical of a reported Romanian move to use only Romanian-language place names for cities and villages traditionally known to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s German and Hungarian ethnic minorities in their own languages. About 1.7 million Hungarians and 220,000 ethnic Germans live in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, mostly in the central province of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has expressed mounting concern over what it says are Romanian moves to cut back Hungarian-language education and disperse the minority throughout <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s complaints mask an effort by <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to regain <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, which was ruled by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for several centuries but given to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> after World War I. Both claim that <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> is the area where their nations were first settled, and they have squabbled over the region for decades. In the past two years, however, the dispute has escalated, pointing up the difference between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reformist communism and the tight rule of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which is increasingly isolated from its East bloc allies. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> said violations of minority rights to maintain their own language and culture can `` neither be understood, or accepted ... at the end of the 20th century on our continent.'' The harsh editorial stopped short of blaming <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> for the move to use only Romanian place names, but said `` it could hardly be a local excess ... -LRB- since -RRB- to our knowledge the strings reach much higher.'' Another daily, <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION>, condemned <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s recently announced program to wipe out up to 7,000 villages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> by the year 2000 as `` drastic ... demolition'' and an attempt to quash Romanian, Hungarian and other minority cultures. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> also took <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to task for its unprecedented action in denying <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> ambassador a traditional address on national radio and television to mark <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Liberation Day April 4 The newspaper noted this was a break with tradition, and said without further detail that `` it is regrettable that such themes can emerge between two neighboring Socialist countries.'' Western analysts said Wednesday's attacks were the sharpest yet in the war of words between the nations. Hungarian dissidents, who demonstrated for human rights in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> outside the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Feb. 1, have charged the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> government is to some extent exploiting popular Hungarian unease about the treatment of ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to divert attention from the country's economic crisis. But <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> took unprecedented action last month when it approved spending about $ 6 million to help an estimated 10,000 refugees who have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Many but not all of the refugees are ethnic Hungarians.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted today to pay former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s $ 202,433 in legal fees for the impeachment trial that removed him from office. The 16-13 vote came shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> formally closed the impeachment trial that began Feb. 29 and resulted in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s ouster from office on Monday Defense attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to begin a `` healing process'' by paying the fees. `` This has been an agony,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` I think it's the right thing to do ... to show that this body not only has class, but it has heart, it has compassion.'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON> agreed, saying it would be a `` magnanimous gesture.'' GOP Sen. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said she thought <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s legal fees should be paid because <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> taxpayers funded the prosecution and trial, and many `` resent deeply their tax dollars being used to convict a governor that they supported.'' However, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, also a Republican, argued against paying the defense costs. `` We did n't start this process; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> did n't start this process'' when it impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the governor, started the process.'' <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said that if senators wanted to show compassion they might want to pay the legal fees themselves, adding, `` I ca n't believe you can do that with somebody else's money. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> suggested that the state and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> split the cost. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Monday to remove <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican, from office for obstructing justice by trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and for misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. GOP Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said he thought the matter should be referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and suggested that the $ 92,000 governor's protocol fund _ which remains in a bank _ might be used to pay <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s expenses <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he expected to be paid whether the money came from the state or <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> himself. The attorney said that when he met with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> after his conviction, `` I found not one sign of retribution in him of any thought of revenge or rancor.'' `` He said to us that when your first vote was completed ... that he felt relieved,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The prosecution took no position on whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s fees should be paid. Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> said the matter should be up to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s discretion.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Deposits Up for Fifth Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deposits at federally insured savings institutions grew for the fifth consecutive month in February, continuing a trend begun after the October stock market crash, the government said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates 3,126 savings institutions, said net deposits increased by $ 5.2 billion, compared with a $ 5.4 billion increase in January and a $ 1.1 billion net withdrawal in February 1987. The increase came despite the deteriorating financial condition of many thrift institutions, particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where institutions have been hit hard by the depressed energy and real estate markets. A third of the industry lost money last year, pushing overall 1987 losses to a post-Depression record of $ 6.8 billion. Despite the losses, money has been flowing into S & amp; L accounts, which are insured up to $ 100,000, since the crash: $ 6.2 billion in October, $ 3.2 billion in November, and $ 2.6 billion in December. That is reversing what was described as a slow-motion run on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, which had net withdrawals in seven of the first nine months of last year. `` I think you're still getting, as late as it seems, a kind of stock market effect here,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group. `` Although the stock market has n't declined since October, it has n't gone up much either. A lot of consumers are rethinking what they're doing with their money and parking some or all of it into thrifts and perhaps banks,'' he said. Unlike the early months after the crash, which saw an increase in deposits of $ 100,000 and more, the increase so far in 1988 has come in smaller accounts, which are institutions' least costly source of funds. Meanwhile, in a separate report, the bank board said interest rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell from 10.48 percent in early February to 10.34 percent in early March, the lowest since last April. Rates on the most popular type of one-year adjustable mortgages, those with caps on how much the rate can change, fell less sharply, from 8.72 percent to 8.65 percent. The bank board figures do not reflect the most recent nudge upward in interest rates. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have edged up from 9.84 percent on Feb. 12, the low for this year, to 10.05 percent on April 1. This survey did not include add-on fees, known as points, which are included in the bank board averages. Mortgage lending by S & amp; Ls rose slightly to $ 13.5 billion in February from $ 13.1 billion in January, which was the lowest level since February 1985, the bank board said.

 Teams of weather scientists will be cruising the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> over the next four months, but it's all for research. Heat and moisture from the oceans have a major impact on weather and climate. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientists want to learn more about how the air and water interact. The first leg of the work is under way, with the team sailing from <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Scientists are measuring the amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and other gases in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> surface waters and the overlying air. Similar sampling was done in 1983, and the new study will allow comparison of the changes in these gases. Concentrations of the gases in the upper atmosphere can prevent heat from sunlight from being reflected out into space, possibly leading to a warming known as the Greenhouse effect, according to <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. At the same time the scientists will sample sulfur gases and look for aerosols in the sea and air. These chemicals could increase the reflective power of the clouds over the ocean, reducing the amount of sunlight and heat reaching the surface. At <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, a second team of scientists will board the research ship Oceanographer to begin a study of the periodic changes in ocean temperature and air pressure known as the El Nino phenomenon. The <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> has been blamed for unusual changes in weather around the world, but scientists are not sure how these effects occur. During a cruise from <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> they will measure air pressure and ocean currents and temperature, all factors which appear to play a role. In addition they will perform maintenance on an array of moored and drifting sensors which collect weather data and send the information back via satellite. Joining the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> meteorologists on the first leg of the trip are scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today described as `` a throwaway remark'' a comment by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicating approval of the notion of pardoning indicted former aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not say that he would pardon former White House aides or others accused in the Iran-Contra affair. But, after hearing a proposal for pardons, he did say `` I like the sound of those words,'' said one congressman quoted in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Another congressman quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying, `` I like hearing what you said,'' after Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> suggested the president should pardon <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> at the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., suggested the pardons be signed during ceremonies at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> During a briefing for reporters at this seaside resort, not far from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was questioned about the president's intentions. `` I was there at that meeting, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said he hoped that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be pardoned, and the president told him he is not discussing pardons at this time,'' the spokesman said. `` And then there was some throwaway line, and I did n't give it any significance then or at this time,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basis of a throwaway remark. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he could not remember <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s precise words, but he did not dispute the quote attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I have raised the issue with the president four or five times, and every time he has said he was n't discussing pardons,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s proposal and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s response reportedly were made March 22 during the president's appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a closed meeting attended by 160 of the 177 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the congressmen who quoted the president asked not to be identified since it was a closed session. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted one congressman as saying he felt the president's message was unmistakable and `` If I had been <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> and witnessed that, I would have been pretty upbeat.'' The meeting occurred six days after <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, along with arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, pleaded innocent to federal criminal charges in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of money to Contra rebels fighting the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Three days later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be found innocent `` because I do n't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any crime.'' Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Center for the Study of the Presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the Iran-Contra affair `` the so-called scandal'' and said he still considered <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` a hero.'' The president later said he was referring to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s combat in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a day after the indictments that there had been no discussion of pardons. `` We do n't discuss pardons. Period,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not consider pardons until after <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> are tried. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today he had not been aware of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks.

 Chinese authorities have arrested 203 people for illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146 pelts, representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at the last count, the World Wildlife Fund said Wednesday. `` These are shocking revelations,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, president of the fund's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate, said in a statement. `` The situation appears to be worsening for the panda,'' with the march to extinction more advanced than previously believed and hunting the greatest threat. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said it was the first time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had released such detailed statistics. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last public estimates of the panda population were made in 1976 _ about 1,000 animals. Another survey is under way this year, and results have been announced only for the <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION> Nature Preserve _ 145 animals in 1976, 72 now. Chinese authorities up to now have said poaching at been controlled, though the possibility of the death penalty for poachers was announced last fall, the fund said. Forestry Minister <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Dezhan </PERSON> announced the arrest statistics in February. He reportedly said 150 people still were sought in connection with an investigation into poaching and fur trading in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where almost all pandas live. Twenty-six people have been sentenced to prisons terms ranging from a year to life, <PERSON> Dezhan </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Some pandas are believed caught in snares set for another endangered species, the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> musk deer, whose oil is valued in traditional <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> medicine. Panda furs fetch high prices when smuggled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said a fund representative, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, saw accounts of Dezhan's speech in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> newspaper on Feb. 27, but had been traveling and unable to confirm the figures with Chinese officials until recently. The panda is a shy mammal that looks like a black-and-white bear but is believed by many zoologists _ not all _ to be closely related to the raccoon. It has been known to be under severe strain as its forest habitat retreated under farming pressure. The panda eats only certain kinds of bamboo found in the forest. So little was known about the panda that it was not classified as an endangered species until 1984. The fund said it was renewing its Ferbuary request to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to deny import permits for short-term exhibitions of pandas in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>, spokesman for the service, said applications had been received only from organizations in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. The service, he said, will make no decisions on the permits until it gets information from the Chinese government on whether the exhibitions affect the population in the wild and the captive breeding population in Chinese zoos and whether rental payments from the exhibitions are being used to benefit the species.

 An empty commuter train slammed into the back of another empty train during Wednesday's morning rush hour, killing a railroad engineer, injuring two other workers and shutting down the busy New Haven line.

 Some 800 Marines are going to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for training exercises, but the troop movement is not related to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military security build-up prompted by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political turmoil, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, will begin arriving in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Friday at an American jungle operations training center. `` This should not be confused with the current security enhancement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' involving the deployment of about 1,300 troops earlier this week, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the 800 Marines are scheduled to take three weeks of training, but did not say whether a similar number is leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` There's a constant turnover of training exercises,'' he said. `` They will be there for three weeks and then they will come out. The only reason we announced this ... was so we could emphasize that it was not related to the security build-up in the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Southern Command.'' Administration officials are increasingly frustrated with the failure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions to dislodge Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser said Tuesday. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, briefing reporters during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vacation near here, would not rule out the possibility of sending more American troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, beyond the additional 1,300 dispatched this week, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers new steps to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would not say how long <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would wait for the sanctions to work. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the administration continues to weigh military, political and economic options, but he refused to comment on recent reports saying a possible <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> kidnapping had been discussed. `` There has been a lot of speculation about positions that various parts of the administration hold on different subjects,'' he said during Tuesday's briefing, `` but it's really nothing until the president calls it.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has clung to power despite the economic sanctions, strikes in his country and the continued presence in hiding of deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>.

He said that while the punitive measures `` are having a telling effect'' on the Panamanian economy, `` they have not yet created enough pressure to remove General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. ...

A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it may not be possible to persuade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to withhold the tax payments voluntarily. He said some businesses `` are having difficulty because of their need to operate in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and because of what they believe are their legal obligations.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to the Central Asian city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> under unusually tight security Wednesday to meet with Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, apparently to work out a Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in midafternoon, but waited more than six hours before announcing that he would meet with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. No other details were provided, and even Soviet photographers were not allowed to cover the departure or arrival of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plane. Also flying to <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> was Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for the past four days to work out a plan to pull out Soviet troops in the event that formal negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> fail to produce an accord to end the 10-year-old war. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> after their talks, but the wording suggested they traveled separately. <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, is about 450 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and about 1,700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The unusual meeting place apparently was a compromise on protocol, which would make it unsuitable for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who is head of state as well as party leader, to be summoned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Security concerns would prohibit <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from traveling to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where guerrillas have used their U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles to shoot planes out of the sky. Guerrillas aided by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been fighting the Kremlin-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government since an April 1978 revolution brought communists to power in the Moslem state. The current round of the U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, which began on March 2, has been stalled by a disagreement between negotiators for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which represents the insurgents at the talks, over continued foreign aid to the warring sides. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Staes </LOCATION> contends that if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords call for an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military aid to the guerrillas when the Soviet pullout begins, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> also should have to halt arms supplies to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Soviet officials claim aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is a bilateral issue outside the range of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. While the Americans are not officially represented at the negotiations, their refusal to go along with the terms of a peace agreement could render it ineffective. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, told reporters he is still awaiting a response from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on the aid issue. Progress at the latest round of talks has been `` slow but steady,'' he said. A member of the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> delegation said `` all parties agree they are near agreement,'' while another diplomatic source cautioned it was `` a little premature'' to consider the superpower standoff settled. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials said publicly Tuesday that a resolution may be only days away. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Sunday and told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> upon arrival that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had frustrated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks by insisting on `` symmetry'' _ the simultaneous cutoff by both superpowers of assistance to the Afghan combatants. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> renewed the call for `` symmetry.'' He told a news conference before flying to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, that the Soviets have so far rejected the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposal for such a moritorium. `` We are exploring other options,'' he said, but gave no details. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Feb. 8 that if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement was signed by March 15, Soviet soldiers would start pulling out May 15. He also said the withdrawal could be completed within nine months, with most of the Soviet soldiers removed within three months. While the deadline has passed, Soviet officials have asserted the troop pullout will begin this year anyway, with or without a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Sunday he would work out the details of the pullout, focusing on Afghan and Soviet concerns, in case the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> process fails. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> may have been necessary because of disagreements between the two governments over terms of the Soviet withdrawal. While <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s leadership is closely allied with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, there are likely sharp differences over how and when to reduce the Soviet fighting power while protecting Afghan officials from a bloody takeover by the guerrillas. Soviet soldiers entered the war on Dec. 27, 1979, and an estimated 115,000 remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to help <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s army fight off the insurgents. At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said that a pullout would begin two months after completion of an agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but noted that the terms could be revised if the troops are to be withdrawn under a Soviet-Afghan pact. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> refused to disclose details of the four days of talks between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. While in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is to meet with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, and discuss aid to the guerrillas. On Thursday, he is to fly by helicopter to the <LOCATION> Khyber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, the gateway to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> 185 miles west of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Redgrave, BSO Clash On Whether Actress Deserves Damages For

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> deserves damages from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> because its cancellation of her performances after receiving protest threats violated her civil rights, her attorney told a federal appeals court Wednesday. A symphony attorney, however, countered that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law allowed the symphony to cancel the performances because of concerns over artistic integrity stemming from threatened distruptions by people opposed to <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> for her support of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The arguments were heard by a full five-member panel of the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which must decide whether to order a lower court judge to consider awarding <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> additional damages for civil rights violations. The justices gave no indication of when they would rule. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> did not attend the hearing. A three-member appeals panel in October ruled the symphony violated <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s rights in canceling the 1982 performances. The court then granted the symphony's motion asking for full court review of the 2-1 decision. The symphony had hired <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> to narrate six performances of <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s `` Oedipus Rex'' at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanglewood </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Carnegie Hall. But it canceled the concerts after receiving letters and phone calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests because of <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s support of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Trial testimony also indicated symphony officials were warned that allowing <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> to perform might cause it to lose some of its financial support from the Jewish community. In November 1984, a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached its contract with <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and awarded her the $ 27,500 she was to have received for the performances plus $ 100,000 in compensatory damages for work <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> said she lost because of the action. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> threw out the $ 100,000 award in February 1985 and ruled the symphony had not violated her civil rights. The appeals court last October restored $ 12,000 of that award _ the amount <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> would have been paid for a Broadway role she lost during the suit against the symphony. At Wednesday's hearing, attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornstein </PERSON> said the symphony violated <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s First Amendment right of free speech in canceling a non-political performance because of her political views. `` It's the public, in deciding whether or not to purchase tickets, which will determine the artistic intregrity _ in deciding whether to come or not,'' <PERSON> Kornstein </PERSON> argued. But symphony attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> argued that the protests would have prevented the symphony from presenting `` Oedipus Rex'' in the format it desired, and that it has a First Amendment right to decide what shows it will present. `` This decision is at the core of what the First Amendment is all about,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who referred to language in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law that makes artistic integrity a valid defense in canceling a performance.

<HEAD>Jackson Says His Base is Broadening, Dukakis Has Copied Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> put the best face Wednesday on his loss in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> presidential primary, saying he has broadened his base with `` a dramatic increase in support from whites.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> victor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has adopted his message because it has proven popular with voters. `` You look at the basic message formation now, even of our rival, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose lead now is stop drugs, what he's done about drugs, his lead now is save jobs, reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that's the right message. It's the clear <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> message,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said here. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold caucuses on April 16. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took heart from the estimated 25 percent of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> white primary voters who exit polls said voted for him. In most of the primaries to date, he has drawn about 10 percent of the white vote. `` When we look at the results, we have an expanded support base from among whites, a dramatic increase in support from whites, strong support from inner city blacks,'' he said. `` When you look at the demographics of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> we broke through in major ways, a historic breakthrough. Our campaign continues to expand, continues to grow.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters `` it is really premature to discuss what will happen in June,'' if there is no clear-cut delegate leader after the last primaries. But he said his showings to date indicate he is the people's choice `` Of 40 contests that have been run now, I've come in No. 1 or No. 2 in 30 of them and I have a 250,000-plus popular vote lead and so at this stage of the campaign I feel very good,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s claim is based on primary plus caucus votes. In primary votes alone, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a lead. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> signaled Tuesday night that he planned to lay out more details of his policies, after his vague statements drew criticism in recent weeks. In <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, he outlined his plan for reducing the deficit and paying for `` the dream'' _ his program of more domestic spending. He said $ 100 billion could be generated annually by 1993 to reduce the deficit and pay for new programs by freezing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending at current levels and increasing taxes on individuals and corporations. He said the tax rate for richest taxpayers should rise from 28 percent and 33 percent to 38.5 percent, a move he said would affect the top 600,000 taxpayers. He said corporate taxes should move back to the `` 1970s level'' as a percentage of gross national product. `` Simply refusing to give the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> an automatic allowance for inflation would, over the five-year period, represent a 10-percent reduction in planned spending. This freeze is consistent with keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong,'' he said. He also listed other savings from changes in farm programs, closing tax loopholes, including a limit on business entertainment deductions, and taxes to `` discourage mergers and speculation.'' He said some have recently estimated the cost of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s proposals for increased domestic spending at $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion a year `` Some declaim that this is unimaginably large. It is not,'' he said.

 On a June day nearly 300 years ago, two young women were hanged in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> village, and by the end of the summer, colonists had executed 13 women and seven men convicted of being witches. Now a sculptor is nearing completion of the first memorial honoring the victims of the <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> witch hysteria of 1692. `` Tourists would ask me where the witch trial memorial was and I would have to say, ` I do n't know,''' said artist <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON>, who began work on the statue in August 1986. `` Then I found out there was n't one. I decided that, after almost 300 years, these unfortunate people should be remembered.'' His 14-foot bronze statue depicting three sisters accused of witchcraft is to be dedicated in October on <LOCATION> Gallows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. He is preparing the mold for bronze casting next month, and memorial organizers are seeking contributions to cover the $ 300,000 needed for foundry and mounting expenses. The organizers also need city approval for use of the site. <PERSON> Stefanakis </PERSON> said he selected the sisters _ <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloyce </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esty </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurse </PERSON> _ as subjects for the statue because they embodied the irony of the witch trials. Most of those accused were well-established members of the community and devoted church goers. And only those who confessed their guilt in court were spared. Nurse, who was 71 when hanged in July 1692, was the only one of the accused witches to be excommunicated. Esty was hanged along with seven other people on Sept. 22, 1692, the final day of the executions. <PERSON> Cloyce </PERSON> was awaiting execution but was reprieved and spent her life trying to vindicate her sisters' reputations. The witch hysteria began with innocent gatherings of young girls fascinated by the mystical lore of <LOCATION> Tituba </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> slave of a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> clergyman. Two sisters were so aroused by the clandestine meetings that they would cry and shake uncontrollably. Other girls, ages 13 to 20, began to imitate the behavior to get attention. Asked to explain their affliction, the girls began to accuse townspeople of witchcraft. Nearly 200 people, including a minister and the wife of the governor, were charged. Curiously, <PERSON> Tituba </PERSON> and others who confessed were spared. Only those who steadfastly proclaimed innocence were hanged. One man was pressed to death with rocks. `` The Salem witch trials were not unique. There were others in the colonies and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnam </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, which houses the original trial records. `` But <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was by far the worst episode.'' <PERSON> Farnam </PERSON> said a large witch trial memorial proposed in 1903 was abandoned because of cost and lingering guilt. `` There were still some negative feelings about the trials,'' said <PERSON> Farnam </PERSON>. `` There are even still some who do n't want to acknowledge the trials, but after 300 years we've loosened up a bit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> keeps a log of descendants of the accused, some of whom are expected to attend the statue unveiling. `` We wish there were more artifacts from the period, but I really do n't think they wanted to save anything,'' said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think -LRB- the statue -RRB- will serve well, if only as a reminder that nothing like this happens again.''

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is willing to spend more on AIDS, but he also wants carriers who continue sexual activity locked up to keep them from spreading the deadly disease. `` The time has come to quarantine those whose character and conduct are a clear threat to society,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told lawmakers Tuesday in his State of the State address. `` AIDS carriers who refuse to stop spreading this fatal disease should no more be allowed to roam free than criminals armed with a deadly weapon.'' The governor's press secretary, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has n't finalized his proposal on detaining AIDS victims, but the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, under the governor's supervision, is pushing an effort to counsel AIDS carriers and protect the public. The HRS proposal is modeled after a program in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, department spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. `` What do you do with the people who wo n't stop spreading AIDS?'' asked Wise. `` We want them in a facility that can provide counseling and where necesary the medical treatment they need. `` If you just arrest them and throw them in jail, you're giving up on them.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has called for spending $ 20 million this year to fight AIDS, which is expected to infect 32,000 Floridians by 1991. More than 4,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been reported in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since 1981. `` There are millions and millions of dollars for the thousands of AIDS patients who need help,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` But there is also a small amount for that very small, but very dangerous group of AIDS patients who knowingly go out and actively spread the disease.'' That money would be used to renovate a wing of a state tuberculosis hospital in <LOCATION> Lantana </LOCATION> to house about 26 AIDS patients. HRS already has funds for a group home for teen-agers with AIDS and the department has identified a small facility near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> that would house six carriers. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunst </PERSON>, leader of the Miami-based Cure AIDS Now, said threats to isolate carriers drive them underground rather than motivate them to seek testing for the disease. The state already has a law permitting AIDS carriers to be quarantined. The first time it was used was last June when HRS obtained a court order to have a 14-year-old <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> boy locked in a mental ward. That action drew objections from national gay and civil rights leaders and HRS backed down and asked the judge to lift the order nearly two weeks later. The agency, however, used juvenile laws to remove the boy from the custody of his mother, placing him first in a community mental health center and then with a foster family. Under the latest HRS proposals, police would be responsible for arresting AIDS carriers and the courts would be responsible for certifying they are a public health risk, said Wise. A first-time offender would be placed on probation with limited activities and restricted associations. After a second arrest, the carrier would be placed in an around-the-clock supervised living arrangement similar to a halfway house. Finally, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said, incorrigibles would be committed, but in a humane and dignified environment.

<HEAD>Friends Hospital Celebrates 175 Years As Facility for Mentally Ill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Quakers who founded Friends Hospital 175 years ago chose a site on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> so the mentally ill could live and work in freedom from prying eyes and barred windows. That was part of the philosophy the Quakers, led by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scattergood </PERSON>, believed in when they opened the `` Asylum for Persons Deprived of the Use of their Reason.'' The institution is observing its anniversary this week. The `` moral treatment'' of the mentally ill was considered revolutionary at a time when the insane were put in chains in basements or on display for public amusement. `` Today, about every institution espouses ` moral treatment','' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelius </PERSON>, the hospital's coordinator of community relations. `` It was something that was accepted much more widely after Friends opened.'' The hospital was the first institution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exclusively for the mentally ill which was not under government auspices. Believing that `` there's that of God in every person,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION>' treatment included giving each patients as much responsibility as possiblee and and giving each an occupation to increase self-esteem. `` Just because you're sick does n't mean you're useless,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON>, today's director of the facility. The second non-Quaker director of the 11 who have served the hospital, <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON> said 70 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> members are <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION>, according to bylaws. `` It was set up to be Society of Friends dominated to assure the philosophy and principles were adhered to,'' he explained. <PERSON> Scattergood </PERSON> founded the hospital after visiting the Retreat at <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, a hospital for the mentally ill founded by <PERSON> Quaker </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuke </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scattergood </PERSON> quite likely was a depressant himself,'' <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON> said, noting descriptions of him as a `` melancholiac person.'' The original building, built in 1817 and used as administrative offices now, gave each patient a room of his own with a window. Ms. <PERSON> Kelius </PERSON> said planners for the building included a committee on light and air. That tradition continues. Each patient has his or her own room, though the bathroom is shared with one other patient. In 175 years, the hospital has added several buildings. The <ORGANIZATION> Greystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, once the director's residence, houses 13 patients with long-term psychiatric illness in a program to teach daily living skills. At the turn of the century, the Hygeia Building was constructed for hydrotherapy, a treatment similar to a whirlpool with the person wrapped in a towel-like material, according to <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON>. Treatments that once included purging, bloodletting and spinning a patient while seated in a chair were used at Friends Hospital, but have been discarded. `` The medical approach ... changes with the vogue in medicine,'' <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON> said. `` The moral treatment has not changed.'' Patients have two hours daily of activity therapy which may include occupational or recreational therapy, creative arts and horticulture. The first year, <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> had 19 patients. In 1982, the hospital expanded to 192 beds. Now, a day program with 24 people allows patients to undergo the same treatment as regular patients, but leave the hospital at night. At first, the Quakers only wanted to admit patients of their faith and people who had not been ill for an extended period of time. After finding that there were not enough patients to fill beds, they opened up the facility to all faiths and long-term illnesses. The 100-acre site of <LOCATION> Friends </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is no longer rural, but the hospital is still surrounded by open areas, trees and gardens. `` With the development of the surrounding area, we've always had a buffer,'' <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON> explained. `` The fact of the open space has been a community asset.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Prints Criticism of Itself</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper that published a pro-Stalin letter and subsequently came under fire appeared Wednesday to be atoning for its sin by reprinting a Pravda article that criticized its action. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, the official daily of the Russian republic's party and government, published the unusual self-criticism on its entire second page. The newspaper did not make any independent comment on the criticism originally published Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> also received a scolding from other Soviet journalists. <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, editor in chief of the monthly literary journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION>, accused the editors of <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> of lagging behind the times in publishing the letter advocating Stalinism on March 13. Appearing at a news conference on disarmament, <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> pointed to a clock that was two hours slow. `` We've got a clock in front of us. It shows, I do n't know why, half past nine. Probably there's something wrong with that clock and that clock was used apparently in the article of <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> praised Pravda for setting the record straight. `` Its moral position is flawless. Its philosophical position is deep and serious. It reflects revolutionary thinking,'' he said. Pravda, in an editorial, sharply condemned those advocating the repressive ways of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> that led to the deaths or exile of `` many thousands'' of people and the `` administrative-command methods'' of economic management that discouraged local initiative. The daily said the letter in <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, written by a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher, was `` an attempt, little by little, to revise party decisions.'' It said <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON>'s publication of the letter worked against Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s programs of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring of society. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged perestroika and his policy of `` glasnost'' _ more openness _ have generated controversy. `` Some are panicking. There are people who think everything is collapsing. Just as in the beginning of this century ` matter vanished' in the perceptions of some people as a result of new discoveries in physics, now it seems to some that socialism is vanishing,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> on Tuesday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, a weekly that has been in the forefront of glasnost, also joined the chorus of condemnation of <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. It said opponents of perestroika `` were not bothered by the fate of the country, the fate of socialism in the years of repression or stagnation, which brought the country to the threshold of a moral, ideological and economic crisis.'' The comments appeared in this week's edition of the newspaper, put out by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> and Cultural Relations with <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to a brief editorial, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> also published a letter from a Muscovite condemning the approach of `` firmness'' advocated in the <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> letter. It also reported that anonymous typewritten leaflets have been found in mailboxes warning that perestroika will lead to `` economic catastrophe and social shock _ and then to enslavement of the country by imperialistic governments.''

<HEAD>Higher Energy Taxes Would Hurt Elderly Poor, Study Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elderly Americans with low incomes would be burdened unreasonably by any energy tax increase that did not make special provisions to shield them, two advocacy groups said Wednesday. A report commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> said one or more energy taxes `` is likely to develop strong political support'' in the push to reduce the federal deficit. The report urged that those favoring higher energy taxes consider `` the impact that these energy taxes would have on the poor and on other Americans living on fixed incomes.'' `` Unlike those of us who may have become casual about our use of energy, the elderly poor can not readily adopt conservation strategies because for the most part they are already conserving wherever and however they can,'' the report said. The report, based on Census and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data, said about 5.8 million elderly households with average annual incomes of $ 5,300 have only $ 500 a year left in so-called discretionary income after paying existing housing, food and home energy costs. `` The average low-income elderly household must pay for clothing, medicine, transportation and other necessities on a budget of less than $ 10 a week,'' it said. `` So a seemingly modest energy tax that might be a minor annoyance to most consumers could be a severe shock to the elderly poor. `` For affluent Americans, a new energy tax would be the equivalent of a luxury excise tax: mildly irritating but bearable.'' But for the elderly poor, such a tax `` would be a calamity,'' the report said. `` If some sort of energy tax is enacted, and if that legislation fails to provide special protections for the poor, millions of our neediest citizens _ especially low-income seniors _ will suffer as a result,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, director of the Villers organization. `` An energy tax without low income protections will be devastating to millions of persons.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON>, director of the senior citizens council, said, `` Clearly, any across-the-board energy taxes would leave the poorest citizens with nothing but losing options.''

 Eleven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators met with Soviet defense experts and scientists Wednesday and told them the issue of human rights takes precedence over negotiations on conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, one of the senators said. The delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, led by Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., met with deputy Politburo member <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON>, Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> and academician <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> for discussions centered on security and improving trust between the two A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency account of the meeting said the Soviet participants outlined proposals for spurring the Vienna-based talks on conventional arms reductions, but said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had already rejected the ideas. `` We told them there is no support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for beginning conventional arms control until the meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> finishes with good results,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. He referred to the European human rights forum that has been unable to produce a plan for improving individual freedoms in the 35 member nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said the senators found a greater willingness on the Soviets' part to work toward improvements in superpower relations and further arms control measures. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON> claimed a treaty eliminating half of both nations' strategic nuclear weapons could be completed in time for the next summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` given mutual desire.'' However, Soviet officials have conceded privately that time is running short before the May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and major differences persist on the issue of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s space-based missile defense system. The Soviets contend the project violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by both nations. <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON> reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> line that any pact on strategic weapons cuts would have to adhere to the ABM agreement. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> restated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s desire to jointly work out measures for monitoring and verifying the disarmament process, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said the delegation told the Soviets they would like to see detailed proposals on how they propose to ensure compliance in the event an accord is signed in the future banning nuclear testing or use of commercial space vehicles to bring weapons into the cosmos.

<TEXT>
 A 61-year-old college professor smitten by the Scottish burr of a bank teller machine's recorded voice met the woman behind the accent Wednesday _ with his wife of 25 years watching closely. `` I guess the first thing I should say is, ` Your transaction is processing,''' said British radio talk-show host <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> as she met <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, after a trans-Atlantic flight arranged by the <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> newspaper. That's the phrase that inspired Ferry, an education professor, to write a Feb. 4 newspaper column about his `` infatuation with the talking teller.'' The item intrigued the <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Review's editors, who tracked down Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> and arranged for her trip after deciding that Ferry `` should get to meet his infatuation.'' `` This is just great,'' said Ferry, decked out in a black suit and red tie for their meeting at a private club. `` She is very sweet, she is very charming,'' he said later. `` She is a person I'd very much like to have for a friend.'' Apparently, the feeling was mutual. `` I think he's smashing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, 29. `` He's what I call wacky, because he's got that wacky sense of humor.'' Mrs. Ferry, who waited arm-in-arm with her husband for Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>'s arrival, said interest in the meeting on both sides of the ocean `` was really overwhelming.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Review reported that the story made a splash in the British press, where it was called a `` romantic rendezvous'' triggered by a Scottish accent that is `` driving an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teacher wild.'' `` We take it as a joke,'' Mrs. Ferry said. `` We're having fun with it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, who is single, made the teller-machine recording three years ago in <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, for <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> is the design and manufacturing center for <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION>'s automatic teller products worldwide. The recording was provided as a demonstration tape to banks that bought the machines, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farkas </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. In his column, Ferry described Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>'s voice as a `` seductive, sophisticated high-English way of speaking.'' `` I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' he wrote. `` My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money Network station at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> downtown.'' Mrs. Ferry said she first heard the voice last weekend. `` I made <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> withdraw some money so I could hear the voice,'' said Mrs. Ferry, 50. `` I liked it.'' Before Wednesday's meeting, Mrs. Ferry called the episode `` a little unreal,'' asking, `` How would anyone feel if a young sexy person wants to meet your husband?'' But Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> seemed to have won her over as well. `` I thought she was charming,'' Mrs. Ferry said. `` I've thoroughly enjoyed this. Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>'s schedule for Wednesday included a taste of small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Taylorville </LOCATION>, a city of 10,000 near <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, as well as dinner at a country club and a nighttime tour of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. She was also to attend a baseball game in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and make public appearances at several banks in central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Democrat Dukakis Steers Course Toward New York; Bush-Dole Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> basked in the glow of his unexpectedly strong <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary victory on Wednesday as he and his Democratic presidential rivals pointed toward <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a cauldron of political intrigue if there ever was one. From campaign rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won accolades on his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> landslide. `` It puts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the catbird seat,'' said former party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shunned any such talk, likening the race to a 15-round boxing match that will be decided by a decision, rather than a knockout. `` My job is to go out now and do the very best I can in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and those other very important primaries ...'' he said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There were political aftershocks on the Republican side of the race. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain nominee, met privately with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, once his strongest rival. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he envisioned a role for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the general election in which the Kansan would work `` as much as he possibly has time to give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the country.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said they talked about `` getting <PERSON> George </PERSON> elected in November.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also met with former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who remains in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race, and said, `` We talked about ... how <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> might be helpful in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races and state legislative races, build this party from bottom up.'' <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s Democratic runnerup, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigned in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and pronounced himself more than satisfied with his showing thus far. `` Forty contests have been run now,'' he said. `` I've come in No. 1 or No. 2 in 30 of them.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claimed credit for changing the terms of the campaign debate, noting that other candidates have begun to address issues such as the fight against drugs and securing jobs for workers. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who finished a distant third in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and now faces a make-or-break test in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pronounced himself the underdog. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state has always been friendly to underdogs,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> made plans to suspend his campaign on Thursday following his fourth place finish in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but was expected to remain in the race as an inactive candidate in hopes of gaining additional delegates in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and elsewhere. But congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator would not seek to participate in campaign debates scheduled in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the next two weeks. Intentionally or not, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to remain in the race does <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a favor in the delegate chase. Under party rules, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is entitled to 13 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> none. A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s column, and thus give him at least a temporary lead in the national delegate competition <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a lead currently in the delegate count, 740.55 to 704.55 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 394.8 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 170.5. With 225 delegates at stake on April 19, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary represents one of the most important tests of the year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the public opinion polls in the state, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> trailing, and a victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would firmly install him as the front-runner in the Democratic race. `` The nominee will be determined in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> Amnerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have a two-person race -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- and we have a front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a nominee and not a brokered convention.'' But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has signed up media consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, a sometime adviser to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, and has decided to spend $ 1 million on television advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In an attempt to woo the large Jewish vote in the state, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> already has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his views on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and has taken on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the same topic. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> entered the fray last week, when he said Jews `` have got to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has spoken warmly of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the past, although he has not endorsed him. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s most talked about non-candidate, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, also figures in the primary campaign. The governor has yet to issue an endorsement, although he has been courted for months by all the contenders, and there were discussions with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign several weeks ago. `` <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> and I are friends, we're colleagues, we're neighbors,'' he said in a television interview. `` I'd love to have his endorsement, but I resopect that decision and we'll just see what happens.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was giving merely a `` throwaway comment'' when he made a remark interpreted by some congressmen as a sign he might pardon former aides <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` I do n't think it's safe to make any conclusions about the president's attitude about pardons,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vacationed at his mountaintop ranch. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed that the president, at a closed meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on March 22, had been urged by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., to pardon <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who have been indicted on felony charges in the Iran-Contra affair <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign pardons in the final days of his term next January, possibly in a ceremony at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s comments were greeted by applause from other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressmen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I like the sound of those words,'' according to one unidentified congressman quoted by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Another lawmaker recalled the president as saying, `` I like hearing what you said.'' Some lawmakers have taken <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment as a hint that he will pardon the two former national security aides, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> played down the significance of the remarks. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` told them he was not discussing pardons, period, and then he had some throwaway line which was similar'' to the remark quoted by the congressmen. `` I gave them no significance at the time. I do n't give them any significance now. Certainly you've heard the president say much stronger things than that in terms of his feelings about <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>,'' the spokesman said. He added, `` I do n't believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basis of that throwaway comment.'' Emphasizing his point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It's been three weeks -LRB- since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment -RRB-. There could n't have been too much _ you'd have had 40 congressmen running out of the room, grabbing the cameras like you ca n't believe. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I have raised the issue -LRB- of pardons -RRB- with the president four or five times myself and I've heard it raised by others, and every time the president says the same thing: ` I'm not discussing pardons.''' However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made several comments that have fueled speculation about pardons. Answering a question from a student last month, he expressed the conviction that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` are going to be found innocent, because I do n't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any crime.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I still think <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> is a hero.'' Days later, he qualified his remark about heroism, saying he was referring to combat honors North had won in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has said the president `` is committed to seeing that the legal system operates. And I do not anticipate that he'll address the pardon issue until it does.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to interpret what <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> meant about seeing the legal system operate. `` I do n't know,'' he said. `` I've not heard the president say that.'' North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, along with arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, have pleaded innocent to federal criminal charges in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of money to Contra rebels fighting the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

Although <PERSON> Axen </PERSON> holds no office in the East German government, he is the top international affairs officer of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls government policy. <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, Bulgarian minister for foreign economic development, will meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during an April 25-26 visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, a former deputy premier whose post was created in a recent government reorganization, will be the first Bulgarian cabinet minister to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since World War II. Since 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has gingerly increased its overtures to Soviet bloc countries, not with great hopes of wooing them from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s domination but to chip away wherever possible at hard-line human rights and economic policies. In visits over the past two years, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> has told leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> eagerness to expand commercial ties will depend on their willingness to improve human rights conditions. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said that during <PERSON> Axen </PERSON>'s talks, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials will renew pleas for better human rights performance, notably in the realm of religion. In what the official described as a `` mixed bag'' of actions, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year allowed two massive religious assemblies, and the East German Jewish community was allowed to install its first rabbi since 1967. In recent weeks, however, there has been a crackdown on environmental groups affiliated with churches, the official said. Axen and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also will discuss the two countries' effort to settle financial claims by Americans whose property on East German territory was taken during and after World War II. The claims total more than $ 70 million. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to get other countries to do more to stop terrorism and the flow of drugs is another likely topic, the official said. An East German diplomat said `` the main intention of these talks will be to promote the relationship between both countries and contribute to a further buildup of the relationship.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and East German officials said they doubted there would be serious talk about a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, as was reported in a West German magazine. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is known to be interested in such a visit `` but it is n't ripe for discussion,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said In talks with the Bulgarian official, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is expected to reassert requests for better human rights policies, notably toward <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s sizable Turkish and <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> minority. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> wants to expand trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beyond the current $ 130 million level. Before he leaves the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on May 2, <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> is expected to call for improved commercial ties during talks at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in meetings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 With jury selection almost completed, opening arguments were scheduled Thursday in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors, prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the 12 people who will decide whether <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is guilty of illegally selling a regulated drug The state maintains that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, then a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago. The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors, trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given the case and from the fact that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, now 24, is the son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the prominence of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> could affect his view of the case. Many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had read, because of a distrust of the press. `` They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because they have been charged,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chittenden </PERSON> said he was `` not a firm believer in what the media prints.'' Another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had `` picked on'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s family while she was a candidate in 1984, and she thought the attacks had carried over to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> after his arrest. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, have been present for the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the presiding judge. Police said they began their investigation of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> after hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling the cocaine to an undercover police officer. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> has asked potential jurors if they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was entrapped by the police, and that the police singled him out because of his famous mother.

<HEAD>Age-60 Limit for Pilots Must Be Justified</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> must justify to a jury its requirement that test and training pilots stop flying at age 60 and ca n't rely on a similar limit for commercial pilots, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated an age discrimination suit by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the Seattle-based aircraft company. According to the court, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has 41 pilots who train other pilots and 24 who make test flights. The company set its age-60 limit in 1980, forcing some pilots into layoffs or early retirement, the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> suit, citing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s longstanding rule requiring pilots of large commercial passenger planes to stop flying at 60. She said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule was based on safety concerns that applied equally to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said a jury must decide on the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that it would be practical to examine pilots over 60 for disabilities, rather than automatically disqualifying them. Under federal law, the court said, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> must prove that individual testing is impractical. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule applies only to certain commercial pilots, and the agency has expressly refused to apply the rule to other types of piliots, said Chief Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> in the 3-0 decision. `` It may be that the age-60 rule reflects an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> decision to resolve any doubts about the necessity for an age qualification in favor of the substantial number of passengers carried by -LRB- the airlines covered by the rule -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. He said a court can not assume that the same considerations would make an age-60 limit a business necessity for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who is 69 and recently announced his intention to step down as chief judge but remain an active member of the court, said Judge <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> did not consider <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> evidence of new scientific testing methods accurately predicting individual loss of function. He said <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> also disregarded evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employed pilots over 60 without incident before 1980, that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had rescinded its age-60 limit for pilots, and that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and airlines have used elaborate testing procedures to allow pilots to resume flying after being grounded for alcoholism or heart disease. There was also evidence that some of the work done by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> pilots, such as flight training, was less stressful and dangerous than the jobs of commercial pilots, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said.

 Talk about forgetful! <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> lost his winning $ 1.25 million lottery ticket twice, then mislaid the keys to his safety deposit box, where he had thought his treasure was safe. With his initial winning payment of $ 47,523 finally in hand, his family said Tuesday that some of the money would go toward repairing damage done to the house of the 77-year-old man when relatives ransacked it searching for the misplaced ticket. The retired shoe-store owner lost the ticket the first time soon after learning Jan. 6 that he had won the prize. The family tore apart his home for four days and finally found the ticket in a pillow. The place was pillaged again for a week when he forgot his second hiding place until _ a moment that some interpreted as divine intervention _ the ticket was found in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s Bible. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> put it into the safety deposit box. He was on the verge of shelling out $ 75 for a duplicate set of keys when he found the originals in a safe place at the back of his closet. Finally <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s wife, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, sewed a small cloth pouch for the ticket and he bound it to his arm using adhesive tape _ enough to make it look like a cast. He kept it there until he collected his prize March 31.

<HEAD>Fate of Afghan Leaders Uncertain After Troop Withdrawal, Soviet
Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading Soviet expert on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Wednesday that the pro-Kremlin regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> may survive the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> but that the lives of its leaders `` are in the hands of the almighty.'' In a remarkably pessimistic public assessment for a Soviet, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime controls about 30 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, including most administrative centers, that tribal leaders control about 30 percent, and that the Islamic guerrillas known as mujahedeen control just over 30 percent. The complicated balance of power hampers predictions of what will happen when and if the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pulls out, said <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON>. Although some guerrillas have close ties with the fundamentalist Moslem government in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said, `` my impression is that an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is impossible'' because tribal leaders are so strong. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts believe that the pro-Kremlin government will collapse immediately after a Soviet pullout, and that regime officials who do not leave will be targets of revenge from the families of the estimated 1 million Afghans who were killed or the 5 million Afghans driven into exile during the war. `` Individual acts of revenge may take place,'' <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said. `` But I hope that a blood bath will not take place.'' `` It is impossible to predict the future of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>,'' the leader of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime, he said. `` But we have the impression that the regime of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> may survive.'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, uses a single name. As for for the fate of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other leaders, <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said, `` their life is in the hands of the almighty.'' <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON>, in a lecture at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, declined to speculate how many members of the current government might flee. But he said that `` some middle-sized leaders in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> want to emigrate to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries. That is their private business.'' <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON>, who retired last fall as head of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> and Near East Section of the Oriental Institutes Section of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unable to comment directly on stalled <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations designed to end the war. The Soviets say that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert aid to the guerrillas should end within 60 days after an agreement is signed. But <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, representing the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the guerrillas, insists that <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> stop at the same time. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to the Soviet Central Asian city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> on Wednesday to meet with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> for talks thought to center on plans for a withdrawal of Soviet troops even if the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks collapse. Under the Soviet system, experts such as <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> not only write scholarly works but are asked to prepare classified reports for the key decision-making body on foreign relations, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretariat. <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> declined to say what advice he has the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, explaining that `` a lecture is not a confessional.'' He denied that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> plans to annex any part of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. And he avoided direct comment on speculation that Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signalled an end to the so-called `` Brezhnev Doctrine,'' invoked in the past to justify military intervention to prop up communist regimes in such nations such as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> clamed that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> never had a communist government. Although <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his colleagues represent a leftist faction within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON>, `` there are not any communists'' among them. `` The biggest part of them are Afghan nationalists. They are not communists, they are not socialists,'' he said, drawing a fine line which was challenged vocally by some Afghan emigres in the audience. The chances that a pro-Kremlin regime would prevail in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are bolstered by the high rate of party membership, 75 percent, among military and police officials, and by the large number of Afghans, 400,000, employed by the state, he said.

 A convicted rustler and unrepentant cowboy who has had frequent run-ins with the government was recommended Wednesday for a gaming license at a tiny rural casino. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 57, whose faded jeans are held up by rope suspenders, won an endorsement from the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a license to run two slot machines and a blackjack game at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in the isolated central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who inherited a one-sixth interest in the club from his mother, faces a final review before the board's parent <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on April 21. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbolz </PERSON> said he had been concerned because <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' various run-ins with authorities had n't been fully disclosed.

He said he had hauled another rancher's sheep out of an area where they were interfering with a camp he was running, and simply released them elsewhere. In another case, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he traded some pigs for a vehicle jack, battery and other equipment that turned out to be stolen <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> property. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also salvaged some discarded well pipe on <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> land, planning to build corrals, and wound up with a grand larceny charge which also was dismissed.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' impressive <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> victory stirred cautious optimism among Democrats on Wednesday that the race for their party's presidential nomination would end without a bloodbath at the national convention in July. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had moved on to the next major battleground, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, even as <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> voters were giving him a 20-point win over his chief rival, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was banking on another victory in the April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary to widen his lead in the race. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has rallied from his defeat in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses to win three straight states -LRB- <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` It certainly is a good sign for his campaign, he has momentum as he goes into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s landslide victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, following a strong showing in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, had given the civil rights activist a claim to front-runner status in the race. `` The nominee will be determined in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have a two-person race and we have a front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a nominee and not a brokered convention.'' Former national party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who has been advising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> result `` gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a good bump for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

And this was n't the first time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could say he was on a roll The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> vote `` gives a little boost to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Democratic chairman, and one of the party's super delegates. `` But you've got to put a qualifying clause there that you've got to have a pattern, you've got to go two or three states in a row in order to say that you're a front-runner.'' Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicted the Democrats would choose their nominee on the first ballot of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stop-Jackson movement. `` There's not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. A total of 2,082 delegates is needed for a convention majority. To reach that number, either <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would need to win more than 1,300 of the 1,600-plus committed delegates yet to be chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates, the party and elected officials whose 645 votes could be decisive. `` The super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while,'' predicted White. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said the super delegates were `` looking for a candidate who can ratle off a big string of wins.'' He said most of those delegates accept the view that `` if there is a clear leader after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -LRB- the last two big states to hold primaries -RRB-, that super delegates ought to play a leading role in propelling that person over the top. At three in a row, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gotten a very good start on that.'' An endorsement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> would brighten <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' prospects in the state, but there was no sign the governor was ready to tilt to his <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> colleague. `` I'd like to have it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He knows that. But it's his decision to make, and I'll respect whatever decision he makes It's up to him. `` We're good friends and colleagues. We talk often. ... But he's under no legal or moral obligation to endorse anybody. <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON> said he had seen no indication that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was ready to endorse. The Erie official and others cited the continued presence of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the race as another potential hazard for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON> pointed out that in 1976, another Southerner, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, surprised people by getting a lot of support in the northern and western portions of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. `` The question mark, I think, is does <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> take anything away from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what the hell <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is in there for,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Melley </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teachers union. Still, he added, in light of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, `` I think a lot of Democrats are breathing sighs of relief.''

<TEXT>
 A government minister, speaking in a rare news conference Wednesday, rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had provided missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has behaved responsibly in selling weapons abroad. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> said his government had taken measures to keep missiles from being sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for use in its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Before selling intermediate-range conventional missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> made the Saudis promise to forgo transfer or first use of them, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. The sale was regarded as unusual because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and anti-communist <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> do not have diplomatic relations. `` Our attitude on arms sales is a serious one; it's a responsible one as well,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said heatedly when a reporter asked if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was willing to sell weapons to any buyer. `` Some press tend to pick on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and whenever <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sells weapons <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> becomes the newsmaker. `` How about the weapons flying around the -LRB- Persian -RRB- Gulf region ... the Stinger and Exocet?'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and French-made missiles <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons sales at a wide-ranging 90-minute news conference in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Great Hall of the People. He was accompanied by his deputy, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last year suspended its liberalization of high-tech equipment sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to punish <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the alleged Silkworm missile sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. However, it lifted the freeze during a visit by <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> last month. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it does not sell weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has long adopted strict measures to prevent <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles from flowing into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through the international market,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. He did not give details of the measures. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has shipped Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, not for ideological reasons but because the trade is lucrative. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has used Silkworms in attacks on Kuwaiti installations, claims it captured some of the missiles from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and says it also makes its own. Western observers estimate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sells about $ 2 billion in weapons each year, making it one of the world's top five arms exporters. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not willing to sell to any buyer. In the case of the missile sale to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, he said, increasing the Arab kingdom's defense capability `` is conducive to the stability of the situation in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' On another issue Wednesday, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said his trip last month to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had improved U.S.-Chinese relations. They soured last year over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s arms sales and its use of military force to put down independence protests in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The officials also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> seeks to avoid war with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over the disputed <LOCATION> Nansha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where the two countries' ships clashed last month. Qian accused <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of sending ships to the area `` to provoke <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He also dismissed recent overtures from President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will never establish diplomatic relations with that country. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is a close ally of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will go ahead with a summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> even if <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops have not started pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` That might be an even better reason to go _ to press the case for them to depart and depart as soon as possible,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` So clearly, that would not be a reason for not going. `` The summit is on track and there are a number of issues the president will push while he is in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. ... And if we do n't have action to pull the troops out of -LRB- <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB- by the time we go, I think that would ... probably move to the very top of the president's agenda,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from May 29 to June 2 for his fourth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Feb. 8 that if a withdrawal agreement being negotiated in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was signed by March 15, Soviet soldiers would start pulling out May 15. He also said the withdrawal could be completed within nine months, with most of the Soviet soldiers removed within three months. While the deadline has passed, Soviet officials have asserted the troop pullout will begin this year anyway, with or without a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was difficult to say whether Soviet troops would be withdrawn by the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Every indication we have is that the Soviets are planning on pulling their troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The timetable is now not precise because of their looking into the negotiations, but it does appear that that track is continuing.''

 Voters in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, have unseated their incumbent mayor, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> voters have elected their first new mayor in 28 years and the mayor of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, survived a recall election provoked by racial tension. Elsewhere, a campaign supported by presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> succeeded in defeating a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> charter amendment that was viewed as an attack on the city's highest elected black. <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> Mayor-elect <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said Wednesday he will spend the first 100 days in office balancing next year's city budget, preparing a charter change proposal and making a blueprint for economic development for his once oil-rich city. The budget is expected to fall $ 6 million short next year. <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said he also intends to propose a change in the city's charter, which has been challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> as being unfair to blacks The National Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> filed suit claiming the city's commission form of government dilutes black voting strength. <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, 44, soundly defeated Republican <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 54, in Tuesday's election, claiming 55.3 percent or 45,517 votes to <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s 34.2 percent or 28,142 votes. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, elected in 1986, said he looks forward to spending more time with his family, getting back into banking and refusing to talk to reporters who once called at all hours. In <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> swept to victory over former acting Gov. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> in the race to succeed Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, who is retiring at age 70 after holding the office since 1960. Complete, unofficial returns from the non-partisan election had <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> with 112,902 votes, or 54 percent, and <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> with 93,738 votes, or 45 percent. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, 38, said the margin reflected `` a mandate for change,'' a signal that people `` want the racial and economic divisions to be bridged.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 59, a self-employed tree surgeon elected as a write-in candidate in 1986, easily survived a recall election prompted by remarks he made last October at a meeting with blacks angry over the forced resignation of the black police chief. The white mayor told a predominantly black crowd that if they did n't like <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> they ought to leave. Final returns showed 9,041 voters, or 78 percent, wanted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to remain in office while 2,493 voters, or 22 percent, favored ouster. `` I had hopes it would be this way because I do n't feel like I've done anything that should've upset the community. I'm sorry that it happened,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Tuesday night. Supporters of a defeated <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> referendum, on whether the city charter should be amended to limit the city council president to two one-year terms, said they wo n't give up. Voters soundly defeated the charter amendment by a vote of 46,854 to 25,458 in a special election Tuesday. The measure was aimed at ousting City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who has headed the 21-member Council for the last 15 years. `` We'll come up with something again. Or we'll keep protesting until some kind of change comes through,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudner </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ordinance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reforming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Efficiency, which charged that <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> abused his power <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s picture was used on literature against the amendment and a radio advertisement featured <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urging voters to defeat it. Unofficial returns showed 46,854 votes against the measure, or 65 percent, to 25,458 in favor, or 35 percent. <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a city rocked by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s announced closing of an auto plant, also turned back an incumbent. With 33 of 34 precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> with 12,329 votes to 10,130 for Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorff </PERSON>.

 A judge Wednesday granted surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> unsupervised visits once a week with the child she bore under a $ 10,000 contract and urged a truce in the Baby M legal battle. Both sides said they wo n't appeal the ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>, bringing to a close a court fight that sparked worldwide debate on parental rights and reproductive technology. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> held that 2-year-old <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, originally dubbed Baby M in court papers, will not suffer emotionally by seeing Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> for one six-hour visit a week. He said the schedule will be expanded over the next year to include overnight stays, some holidays and two weeks in the summer of 1989. `` She and her mother have the right to develop their own special relationship,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said in a decision filed in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> and made public by attorneys here. The child's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, have custody of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. They wanted <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> to delay for at least six years visits between <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, who had been seeing the child for two hours once a week under supervision. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> also moved to protect <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s privacy, barring both sides from discussing her publicly, such as in the promotion of books or movies, without court approval. But <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>'s ruling allows both sides to talk about their experiences, clearing the way for a book Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has planned. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> said in a statement released by her attorneys that her relationship with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> `` will be strengthened and advanced'' by the visitation and she looks forward to a `` meaningful and substantial relationship.'' `` I hope that beginning today, there will be a renewed spirit of cooperation between all of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s parents; that this cooperation will be fueled by our common interest in ensuring her happiness and welfare,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>. The Sterns were generally unhappy with the ruling, but will not appeal, said one of their attorneys, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>. `` It was n't their satisfaction with the decision that made them decide against appealing. They wanted to put an end to the litigation and the publicity and protect <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> rejected the Sterns contention during last week's visitation hearing that Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> would emotionally harm the child and exploit her in the media `` <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is a resilient child who is no less capable than thousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjust to complex family realtionships when their parents remarry,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said. The judge urged both sides to set aside the bad feelings, for <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s sake. `` Family dreams have been shattered, insults and false accusations have been exchanged, and lies and deceptions made in the heat of litigation,'' he said. `` However, family tragedies in our society are not uncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrifices.'' The emotional tug-of-war began after Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, then married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, agreed to be artificially inseminated with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s sperm. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, who is pregnant, has since divorced <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and married accountant <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> gave birth to the child March 31, 1986, but decided to refuse the $ 10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby. That decision led to a landmark <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, which outlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s parental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered the lower court hearing on visitation rights In a related development, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear a child for another couple.

<HEAD>New Sunspot Theory Bolstered By Early Detection Of Solar Jet
Streams</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A theory that upsets traditional notions about 11-year sunspot cycles has been bolstered by the earliest, most detailed observation ever made of solar jet streams that will produce sunspots by 1997, scientists say. Astronomer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> and his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, were able to see the jet streams `` at higher latitudes -LRB- on the sun -RRB- and earlier than we were ever able to before,'' said astrophysicist <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` We're seeing the very earliest stage of the next sunspot cycle, not the one that is producing sunspots now, but that one that will produce them when this cycle is over,'' said <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, who presented his findings Wednesday during a solar physics meeting in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Understanding the sunspot cycle is important because the spots and related explosions called solar flares disrupt radar, radio and other communications on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and, in extreme cases, are believed to contribute to ice ages and major droughts, <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> said Tuesday by telephone from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said solar flares make <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s outer atmosphere expand, so learning more about sunspots is important in deciding when to launch satellites, since atmospheric expansion produces orbit-altering drag on spacecraft. <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> astrophysicist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Altrock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>'s observation of the jet streams, which are east-west currents of gas parallel to the sun's equator, supports a theory they developed independently with <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Last year, they proposed that the 11-year sunspot cycle _ during which the number of sunspots reaches a maximum, then a minimum and then another maximum _ is merely part of a previously unknown 18-to 22-year cycle that produces visible sunspots only during its last 11 years. The theory says that during the earliest stages of this longer cycle, jet stream-like gas currents appear near the sun's poles like smoke rings, which then grow and roll down the sun toward the equator, <PERSON> Altrock </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Sunspot </LOCATION>, N.M. Only when the jet streams reach a solar latitude of 30 or 35 degrees do they produce sunspots, <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said. He said he detected the jet streams at a latitude of 70 degrees on the sun. `` These jet streams eventually will migrate into the region where sunspots form,'' probably about 1997, <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said. The last sunspot cycle reached its minimum in September 1986, so the next maximum is expected about 1991 and the next minimum in 1997 or 1998, <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> said. The current batch of sunspots `` is rising much faster than any other we've seen,'' he added. `` There is evidence to suggest it's going to be unusually strong and perhaps the maximum will be reached earlier than usual, in 1989 or 1990,'' with the minimum following in 1995 or 1996 Sunspots are relatively cool spots, 1,200 to 60,000 miles across, that each appear for three to seven weeks where the solar magnetic field is about 1,000 times stronger than in other locations. Up to 30 appear at one time. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> and his colleagues were able to see the solar jet streams closer to the sun's poles in more detail than ever before by measuring the speed of gases on the sun's surface 20 times daily using the 150-foot-tall solar observatory and 75-foot-deep spectrograph on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Sunlight passes through a lens near the top of the observatory tower. The lens focuses an image of the sun on a hole that lets the light enter the spectrograph. The spectrograph breaks the sunlight into a rainbow of component colors. That allows the scientists to measure the speed of solar gases and detect jet streams. `` It's the same way a radar gun on the highway measures the velocity of a car,'' <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said. The jet streams may help scientists understand why the number of sunspots varies, <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Arms Treaty Will Save Pentagon $1.7 Billion, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Destruction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medium-range missiles under the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will save the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> about $ 1.7 billion through the fall of 1995, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The savings will come because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will no longer need to maintain its Pershing and ground-launched cruise missile force in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Money will also be saved on associated costs for military personnel, procurement, and construction of housing for military family members, it said. `` Army officials told us that some of the equipment procured under the Pershing II program would not be subject to treaty limitation and would therefore be available for use in other <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units,'' the GA0 said. It said this includes radios, trucks, generators, tool kits and other support equipment whose total value is unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, it said, has identified more than $ 550 million in equipment that will be reused and about $ 50 million in funding that will be recovered because of project cancellations. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying that 76 launch control centers, valued at about $ 6 million each for a total $ 456 million, will be reused. And it said about $ 114 million worth of missile components produced under existing <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts will be made available to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for its sea-launched cruise missile program. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also expects to recover about $ 40 million to $ 58 million in previously approved military construction funds, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The treaty would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to destroy a total of 867 medium-range missiles while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be required to eliminate some 1,800 weapons. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles to be destroyed over a 36-month period beginning after the pact is ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, include 178 Pershing IAs, 247 Pershing IIs, and 442 ground-launched cruise missiles, together with their launchers and certain support and training equipment. The costs of actually destroying the weapons are classified and will be provided separately to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spent a total $ 6.5 billion for the Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missile systems, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, including $ 2.6 billion for the Pershings and $ 3.45 billion for the cruise missiles. Those totals include the costs of research and development, procurement, military construction and missile modifications. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 17-2 last month to recommend the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approve the treaty. Barring unexpected developments, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on the treaty is expected to begin late this month or in early May. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was requested by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, an opponent of the treaty.

 A month-long U.S.-Honduran operation culiminating in a predawn police raid in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> put an alleged international cocaine trafficker in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> federal prison Wednesday for questioning in the slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent, officials said. A `` stunned'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> was lodged at the maximum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, after Honduran officials on Tuesday hustled him onto a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement sources said. <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> officials put <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on a New York-bound flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, the sources said. Angry Honduran legislators labeled <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s capture a `` kidnapping,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation of the procedures used. The Honduran constitution prohibits extradition of Honduran citizens to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was kidnapped in open violation of our laws,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' single-house legislature, told reporters Wednesday. `` It does not only violate our constitutional principles and individual guarantees, but also all the state's police laws. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> legislator and editor of the influential newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>, called the action `` an abominable conduct by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>'s administration and the armed forces.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Safir </PERSON>, the chief of operations for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> who is a former <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, has been in and out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for the past month spearheading the effort to get <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody, said the source, speaking only on condition of anonymity. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement sources, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was taken into custody in a pre-dawn helicopter raid Tuesday by Honduran authorities at his home in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> on a warrant signed by a city judge. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, said police and the judge had placed a bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they had found it there. She said there had been no drugs at the residence. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s lawyer, said in a telephone interview that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at his client's home at 5:45 a.m. `` <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was stunned'' by the raid, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source said. `` He could n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been living openly in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after escaping in 1986 from a Colombian prison. In addition to drug charges, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> wants to question <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> about the 1985 murder in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. According to one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement source, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents already have interviewed <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> briefly since his arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped, tortured and killed in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was one of the four prime suspects in the case. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been held in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on charges of involvement with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine-trafficking organization. The marshals service said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was believed to have become a leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of illegal drugs from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities link <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to an increase in transshipment of Colombian cocaine through the Central American country. Honduran authorities put <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on a plane headed for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement sources said. As a Honduran citizen, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> could not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the Honduran constitution forbids it. After being informed <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> put him on a New York-bound jetliner and <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was arrested immediately on board the plane by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, authorities said. He subsequently was placed in a cell at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, which the federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> viewed the arrest `` as a major successful step in our effort to stem the flow of illegal narcotics trafficking. We think that both the Honduran and <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> governments have demonstrated their strong commitment to combatting narcotics trafficking through their actions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the expulsion from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> was based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant for <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> after he escaped from <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1971. He was serving a five-year sentence for illegally entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and using a fraudulent visa. Warrants charged <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> with escape from federal custody, conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other crimes. Allegations have been made of involvement in drug shipments by top Honduran military officials. The government denied the reports in February. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said critics were trying `` to discredit the armed forces and my government, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug traffickers.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in February he makes his living in cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffee trade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $ 2 billion, but he put it at about $ 5 million. He said the charges against him were `` a lie, a story,'' and claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap him. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> said then he never again would leave <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If I appear in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is a kidnapping by American agents. If I am killed, it is the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said at the time.

 The black co-discoverer of the North Pole received what one supporter called `` long overdue recognition'' as his remains were reinterred with full military honors Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> was the first to reach the North Pole and planted the American flag there exactly 79 years earlier during a trek with Adm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> and four Eskimos. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was buried at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> in 1920 and a huge monument to him was erected by his grave. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, however, ended up at his death in 1955 in a shared grave at <LOCATION> Woodlawn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because his wife could not afford a separate gravesite. `` He was denied proper recognition because of the racial attitudes of his time,'' said Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor who successfully petitioned President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to allow <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s reinterment at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. Counter, who previously had brought together <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s part-Eskimo offspring, told about 100 relatives and admirers at the windswept hilltop burial site that the reinterment of <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, was `` long overdue recognition for our hero ... -LRB- that would -RRB- right a tragic wrong.'' `` Welcome home, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Welcome home to a new day in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... May your presence here inspire generations of explorers.'' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s remains now rest alongside <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s, with the remains of their wives on either side. Descendants of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> were joined at the ceremony by <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s part-Eskimo descendants fathered when he was in the Arctic. `` Now, finally, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> can talk about old days out there,'' a grandson, <PERSON> Qitdlaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Qaanaaq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, said through a translator at a news conference following the ceremony. A monument installed next to the gravesite includes a quote from <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, who was 88 when he died: `` The lure of the Arctic is tugging at my heart. To me the trail is calling! The old trail _ The trail that is always new.'' Although repeated references were made to <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s concern that <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s achievements be recognized, none of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s relatives attended the ceremony, <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> said. `` I'm sorry they're not here,'' <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> said at the news conference, adding that he had invited both <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s son and grandson and had offered to help with travel arrangements. He said that if he had known none of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> descendants were going to attend, he would have invited his part-Eskimo offspring. Counter said the costs of the reinterments _ including exhuming the <ORGANIZATION> Hensons </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cemetery, the two bronze caskets, the monument, bringing <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s offspring from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and the rest of the arrangements _ ran into the thousands, but he would not be more specific or say exactly who paid for what. An aide, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> took care of most of the bills. Gen. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckton </PERSON> of the White House military office conveyed greetings from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who approved the reinterment last October. `` All Americans join us today in saluting <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> as he receives the recognition he so long deserved,'' <PERSON> Beckton </PERSON> said. Among those speaking at the ceremony were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Ebony and Jet magazines, and Col. <PERSON> Guion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluford </PERSON>, the first black astronaut. `` <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> taught us all a great deal,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` He taught us to be independent. He taught us to achieve. ... He never got the recognition he deserved, but he never complained.'' <PERSON> Bluford </PERSON> described the ceremony as `` a proud and historic moment in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s history. ... We not only pay homage to him, but we remind future generations of his accomplishment and achievements ... He was the point man in one of man's greatest achievements.''

 Partying vandals made a shambles of a suburban house left in the care of the owners' 20-year-old mentally retarded son, who fled and apparently was afraid to come home. The young man's mother, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> McConaghey </PERSON>, `` tells us he's capable of functioning in society, so everybody's best guess is just that he's frightened,'' Police Sgt <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <PERSON> McConagheys </PERSON> returned home Monday after a week in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but did not file a missing persons report on their son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, until Tuesday. Telephone calls to the <PERSON> McConaghey </PERSON> home were not answered Wednesday. `` I think my <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is still around, but he's just deathly afraid to come home. We want him to come home, and we're not angry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McConaghey </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who had been left in charge of the house in the past, invited a few friends over for a party, <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> said. Over the next few days, word of the open-house bash spread and groups of 10 to 15 party-goers, some driving 20 miles from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, dropped by at all hours. `` We originally thought this was a marathon kind of party, where people heard about this on a party-line -LRB- call -RRB- or the radio ... and maybe 100 or so people descended on the house for a whole weekend,'' said <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON>. `` But as we piece this together, it's something that got out of hand. Kids apparently learned about it by word-of-mouth and just kept showing up in clusters and leaving.'' `` That is a very expensive neighborhood,'' he added. `` Somebody would have called us earlier if there had been big, loud parties going all the time.'' When police were finally called by a neighbor Sunday, officers found <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> home alone and the house in ruins. Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> appeared disoriented said about 100 people had visited over a two-day period. He said he passed out at one point and woke up to find the mess. Police say <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> apparently fled shortly after they interviewed him. Virtually every room in the two-story house was wrecked, all the upstairs doors were kicked in and there was a large hole in one wall, police said. Total damage and theft costs _ including telephones, video recorders and some computer equipment _ could exceed $ 25,000. The family's 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> was stolen but recovered later from a nearby forest preserve, its radio missing. At least one person was arrested with items taken from the McConaghey home, and <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> said Wednesday police expect to make additional arrests. Mrs. <PERSON> McConaghey </PERSON> said she hopes the people who wrecked her house will understand someday what they did. `` I hope this is something they will never forget ... when they are older and in their own houses.''

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case signaled Wednesday he was ready to discuss a `` realistic trial date'' to achieve an `` expeditious disposition'' of the criminal charges against the four defendants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected as too cumbersome a proposal by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> for elaborate procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of 150,000 pages of classified documents that may become evidence in the case. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal `` appears to be far too complex, lacks definite time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair and expeditous disposition of this case,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a brief opinion. Under the prosecution plan, defense lawyers for former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> would be required to obtain security clearances before they could examine the documents at a `` special compartmented information facility.'' The four defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting some of the profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s propposal laid out intricate steps under the Classified Information Procedures Act for court review of sensitive documents that might be introduced by either side as evidence when the case goes to trial. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said defense lawyers can not begin examining the documents until adequate procedures are imposed by the court. He said pre-trial discovery could take three months. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` it will be necessary to frame a more limited protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.'' The judge said he wants to determine `` to what extent'' the documents `` will be made available available immediately'' for inspection by the defense. At a hearing scheduled for next Tuesday, `` the court intends to determine the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a realistic trial date,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he wants to set an April deadline for interagency review of the classified materials that have been collected during <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s 15-month investigation and set a time for the defense to notify the court if it intends to use any secret documents as evidence. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the defense is required to tell the court which material it will use. The statute contains procedures for the court to review the documents to determine which, if any, are relevant to the proceedings. The judge has the power to delete certain secret material and substitute statements of facts a particular document would prove. The so-called `` graymail'' statute was enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to facilitate prosecution of espionage cases and to control the disclosure of classified information at trial. The procedures were envisioned to balance secrecy with the government's need to use classified documents as evidence. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are reviewing the documents assembled by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to determine if any can be declassified. In his pleadings, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the documents `` describe in detail some of the nation's most carefully held secrets about its foreign policy, its intelligence activities and its covert activities.'' The defendants filed a joint opposition to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s motion for expedited consideration of the proposed protective order, noting that North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> had access to many of the documents when they were at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The defense motion said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal raised a number of issues about the constitutionality of the classified information law as well as the independent counsel's power to represent the government's national security interests.

<HEAD>Soviets Head for Nevada to Study Detection of Nuclear Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nine Soviet scientists headed for the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert on Wednesday to conduct tests they hope will prod the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration toward a nuclear test ban treaty. Technicians from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> of the Earth under the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an American environmental group, are to set off two non-nuclear explosions to test the ability of high-frequency seismological devices to measure underground nuclear tests. `` We expect the experiment to produce new evidence on the capability to verify a comprehensive or very low-yield test ban treaty,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, a physicist with the environmental group. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists set off three explosions in similar tests starting in September 1986 near the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear test site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The head of the Soviet team, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yukhnin </PERSON>, told reporters Wednesday that the test results from <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> `` were perceived as quite successful in the technical aspects.'' Considerable political obstacles remain to a nuclear test ban treaty, however. The administration refused to join a 19-month Soviet nuclear test moratorium, which ended in February 1987. In addition, it wants the Soviets to conduct tests of a system called CORRTEX to supplement seismological monitoring of two nuclear threshold treaties signed in the 1970s but never ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Official teams of scientists visited each other's test sites in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> last winter, but no date has been set for the CORRTEX tests. The administration says the tests, which use a cable implanted in the ground to measure yield, would be the first step in a process leading to ratification of the threshold treaties and perhaps to a pact banning nuclear weapons tests outright. Until the current visit, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had denied visas to Soviet scientists wishing to take part in the unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> experiments, said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>, an attorney for the group. <PERSON> Yukhnin </PERSON> said that within the Soviet government, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has given full support to the experiments. I think that the military people were not fully supportive. But they let us set up experimental sites around the polygon,'' as the test site in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> is known. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> tests were designed to measure nuclear blasts in the 1 - to 10-kiloton range, well below the 150-kiloton limit of the threshold treaties A kiloton is a force equal to 1,000 pounds of TNT. The atomic device exploded over <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> at the close of World War II had a force of 1.5 kilotons, or 15,000 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike earlier seismological equipment, <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said, the high-frequency devices being used in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> may have the ability to foil attempts to disguise the magnitude of underground nuclear blasts. Such attempts could be made by a process known as `` de-coupling,'' or setting off the explosions in underground caverns to make them seem smaller. To measure the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> tests, the Soviet team brought over one ton of scientific devices, which <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> described as `` some of the most sophisticated seismological equipment in the world.'' In addition to the team of nine scientists and technicians who arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday and headed for <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> on Wednesday, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, was to arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on April 24 to observe the tests. One 10-ton explosion is scheduled for April 29 at <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, 90 miles north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>; and another 15-ton blast at <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, 100 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has declined to present arguments before a world court hearing on the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, saying international arbitration of the case is not `` appropriate.'' In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to The Netherlands <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> noted that the 1987 Anti-Terrorism Law ordering the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> is being appealed in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court. `` Since the matter is still pending in our courts, we do not believe arbitration would be appropriate,'' <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> wrote. A copy of the letter was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> respectfully declines the court's invitation to submit further views on this issue'' at a hearing scheduled for April 11, he added. <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> noted that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had concluded that the law, which was signed last December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, calls for the closure of the mission `` irrespective of any international legal obligations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have under the Headquarters Agreement.'' The 1947 agreement regulates the presence of foreign missions to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> contend that the agreement, which regulates the presence of foreign missions to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, supersedes American law. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been asked by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must submit to arbitration of the dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. The U.S.-U.N. treaty calls for arbitration of disputes but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to submit to arbitration in this case. Several weeks ago the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> refused to close down its office. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is expected to respond by April 11 and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is expected to file a friend of the court brief supporting its position. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will not present any arguments before the world court either, said its lawyer, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to shut down last year, contending the organization was a terrorist group. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used a similar argument in ordering the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired four missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Wednesday and its warplanes bombed eight other Iranian cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 40 civilians were killed, including three children who died when a hospital nursery was hit. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired two missiles into `` military centers'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in retaliation and shelled Iraqi border towns. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported only one Iranian missile exploding in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, saying it hit a residential neighborhood, killing several civilians. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said two Iranian jets bombed a packed football stadium in the town of <LOCATION> Kalar </LOCATION> in the northeastern <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> province, killing five schoolchildren and wounding 35 others. `` We will take revenge, and the Iranian regime will have to pay dearly for its shameful crimes,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military spokesman as saying. The Iraqis also said their fighter-bombers hit a `` very large maritime target,'' which usually means a supertanker, near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lavan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the central <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the night There was no immediate independent confirmation of the strike. Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> charged that the Iraqis were stepping up their missile and air strikes to disrupt elections Friday for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 270-seat Majlis, or Parliament. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying, `` These raids will fail to prevent the elections. On the contrary, it will make our people more determined to cast their votes.'' The <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> news agency said five short-range missiles were fired into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. It said its anti-aircraft missiles batteries shot down a Soviet-built Iraqi MiG-23 jet and a Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bomber during two of the bombing raids. The MiG pilot was killed, it said, but there was no immediate word on the Sukhoi pilot. Iraqi communiques said air force jets and helicopter gunships flew more than 200 combat missions Wednesday and that only one plane was lost. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s missile barrage was seen as <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s response to an Iranian push into the northeastern mountains of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian air force fighters carried out six attacks on Iraqi troop concentrations north of the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> bridgehead around the strategic <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>. It said Iranian artillery shelled the nearby provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION>, including a power station, as fighting continued in the region 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s big <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oilfields. Iranian communiques said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles hit residential districts in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, killing 16 civilians and wounding scores more. Three of the dead were children killed when a nursery in a hospital was hit, the Iranians said. A hospital official told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent that eight children were killed there. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 21 other civilians were killed and dozens wounded in Iraqi air raids on the western cities of <LOCATION> Ilam </LOCATION>, Dezful, <PERSON> Shustar </PERSON> and four ther towns. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliated with artillery bombardments of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and other Iraqi border cities throughout the day. <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharazzi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s chief military spokesman, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>: `` It is n't easy to intercept and track the missiles.'' He said: `` They move at very high speed. It's an exceptional achievement that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has worked out any warning system at all.'' Half of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million population have fled the capital since the `` war of the cities'' flared up Feb. 29. Both sides have fired nearly 300 missiles into each other's cities, killing hundreds on both sides. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent said lines of cars were seen heading out of the city in the past two days. He said most people were spending their nights in shelters, basements and underground parking lots for safety.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says `Minority' Judgeship Should Not Be Allowed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A white prosecutor running unopposed for a judgeship that was created as an opportunity for minority candidates says he opposes a plan agreed to by legislators to give the county a second new judge. `` I'm very disappointed that the people who entered into this agreement did n't consult with me or my advisers on it,'' <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said about the plan, which emerged Monday after the death of <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lumbee </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> opponent left no minority candidates in the contest. `` Personally, I felt it was an unnecessary move.'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> contended the plan to give the county two <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges does not follow state law and `` is unfair to taxpayers.'' In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, smaller counties are lumped into districts that share judges. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> created a judgeship last year specifically for <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which has a population that is 37 percent Indian and 26 percent black, to give minority candidates a better chance to become judge. But <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, 52, automatically became the Democratic nominee for the judgeship when his opponent, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, was slain March 26 in what police described as a romantic dispute. There is no Republican candidate. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, the state's ranking Democrat, met with legislators from <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and minority leaders Monday to develop the plan for a second judgeship. `` I do n't really see how it can be justified,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Fayetteville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` It's very unusual to have two judges from an area the size of <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' `` Apparently a lot of people have been impressed by the claims of support by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> supporters,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said. `` What's happened is a very small group of people have run a very good bluff for some politicians.'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of the Courts, said, the judgeship would cost the state $ 110,000 a year. Since <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> can be assigned to hear cases in any county, he said the extra judge's time would not be wasted. `` There's no question we can fully utilize this new judgeship. This will provide the extra judge power we believe is needed to handle the extra case filings across the state.''

 Palestinians who renounce terror and recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are welcome at <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks, but not the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or those `` who have committed acts of terrorism,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke in an interview that was televised in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as he met with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. It was taped in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> earlier Wednesday. The secretary, who called <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` a man of peace,'' hopes to persuade the king and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to drop their reservations and agree to negotations. `` Say yes to this initiative,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> implored <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in a statement after a final meeting with the prime minister Wednesday. `` Let us redouble our efforts to make it -LRB- peace -RRB- a reality.'' As he passed the halfway point in his latest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> venture, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged having little to show for his second visit to the region in a month. He said he was still committed to making the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan work, but declared: `` In all candor, I am not able to say that it is happening. While we have made some progress, differences have not been substantially narrowed.'' On departure from <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurion </PERSON> airport, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> pledged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its security, but said in apparent criticism of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s reluctance: `` More fundamentally, security and progress for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> comes from peace between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors. It is possible. It can happen.'' His next stop was <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> reaffirmed approval of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan and said after talking with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that he hoped <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would change his `` conception ... for the hope of peace.'' Palestinian representation is among the most difficult unsettled issues. In 1974, all Arab countries including <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have called publicly for a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> seat in the negotiations, as have ranking Jordanian officials. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan would include Palestinians in a joint delegation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicated the arrangement is satisfactory to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. In 1985, the king appeared to have worked out such an arrangement with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It fell apart, and with it the prospects for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks. In the interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is showing himself `` ready to be engaged'' in the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort by raising questions about the proposal. It calls for talks on Palestinian self rule, then negotiations on an overall settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict. `` He is a partner and is ready to talk and think and work and try to find answers,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said Palestinians who take part in negotiations must be legitimate representatives of the people in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, adding that `` in no way'' could <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> simply choose Palestinians it likes. On the other hand, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is committed to violence and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction so Palestinians who want to negotiate should be willing to `` step up and say ` I renounce terrorism. I accept 242 and a basis for negotiation.''' His reference was to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution that implies recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and calls for it to withdraw from occupied territory. It was passed after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. In an interview Tuesday with Jordanian editors, the secretary ruled out a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, said total <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was `` not in the cards'' and accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of trying to exterminate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His comments were not published or broadcast in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. One official said fear of inflaming anti-American opinion in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which has a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> majority, was among the reasons for withholding them.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, signing a proclamation making April 11-16 National Productivity Improvement Week, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business efficiency must be increased to meet international competition. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that American business productivity growth has been declining since the mid-1960s, and said `` we must accelerate productivity growth in the service and other sectors'' of the economy. Productivity is a measure of the efficiency with which the economy produces goods and services. Overall non-farm productivity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> grew by only 0.9 percent last year, although manufacturing efficiency grew at a 3.3 percent rate. `` Good performance in productivity is especially necessary now that we are in world markets for most goods and services, and because many of our foreign competitors can target the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market using state-of-the-art technology,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement said. `` Our businesses and their individual leaders must continue their efforts to increase productivity by adopting new technologies and management innovations and by better strategic planning in the increasingly competitive international context,'' it said.

 The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on one charge in the trial of 13 white supremacists, and the judge ordered further deliberations on two other counts despite the jurors' contention that they were deadlocked. The jury said it reached a verdict on the charge of conspiracy to assassination two federal officials, which had been brought against five of the 13 defendants in the trial. Still undecided are the charges of seditious conspiracy, brought against nine of the 13 defendants, and transporting stolen money, a charge faced by two defendants. The government contends the defendants planned to form an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> received the verdict involving an alleged plan _ never carried out _ to assassinate a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, but he told the court clerk not to make it public. The jurors, in a note to <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, said they were at a stalemate on the other two counts. But <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said he would not discharge the jury `` after only two days of deliberation after two months of trial.'' The jurors then resumed deliberations for a time before breaking off talks for the day late Wednesday afternoon. The judge told the jurors Monday that he preferred to receive the verdicts all at once. Sixteen verdicts of guilty or innocent are possible. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, one of the most outspoken supremacist leaders on trial, arrived at the courthouse with, as usual, comment for reporters: `` The tumbrels are coming, the guillotine is being prepared, your bloodthirst will be satisfied, your editors will be happy.'' When asked why the government would prosecute him, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said, `` Jealousy, pure jealousy, nothing but jealousy'' of `` all the attention you fellows and your editors have given me.'' Did he ever advocate establishing an all-white nation in the northwest? `` Only in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cohoctah </PERSON>,'' Miles answered. Miles, 63, is from <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where he is pastor of the Mountain Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. Miles and two other defendants _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ are regarded as the top leaders of supremacist groups. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, pastor of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, established the Aryan Nations. Beam, an ex-leader of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, became an ambassador-at-large for the Aryan Nations. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who is free on a $ 100,000 signature bond, and <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, who is held without bond, are, like <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, accused of conspiring to bring down the government by force. The trial began Feb. 16. The government called 113 witnesses, the defense 79. The seditious conspiracy charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail and a $ 20,000 fine. Conspiracy to murder federal officials can be punished by imprisonment for life. Two defendants are charged with transporting stolen money, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million to finance their activities, including about $ 1 million which has not been recovered. Several bombings and some murders also occurred, the government said Defendants contend that the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and now is serving 20 years for racketeering. Six of the seditious conspiracy defendants are serving sentences ranging from 40 years to imprisonment for life, including one death sentence, on charges of racketeering, murder, or violation of civil rights by murder.

<HEAD>Justice Changes Stand On Judicial Review Of Deportation for Asylum
Seekers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> retreated Wednesday from a stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from having their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge. Earlier rules proposed last Aug. 28 would have required that all claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum officers of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Civil liberties groups say <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is unsympathetic to asylum-seekers, an accusation the agency denies. Under the latest proposed revision, immigration judges _ who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, not <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> _ would continue to conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylum-seekers facing exclusion from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or deportation. The change `` is an important improvement,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, a attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Initial asylum applications will be heard by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> asylum officers. But those officers will receive training from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, however, objected to provisions in the new set of proposals which permit immigration judges to deny full evidentiary hearings in certain instances. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> also said the regulations fail to take into account that asylum applicants frequently fail to present asylum claims immediately for fear of reprisals against friends and family members by the government of their home country. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has the power to reject asylum claims that are made following the conclusion of deportation proceedings. The revised rule, published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, will become final after a 30-day public comment period. The proposed regulations are in large measure a response to a March 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling which held that asylum applicants need only show a reasonable fear of persecution in order to gain asylum, rather than the previous threshold of clear probability of persecution.

 A veterans' group Wednesday agreed to admit `` anyone presenting a ticket'' to an oyster dinner it has held for men only for 39 years but said this is the last year it will conduct the event. `` Men have a right to have a stag party,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> chapter of the Forty & amp; <PERSON> Eight </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasociete </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This has always been a classy affair sponsored by a classy organization. We are not pigs and neither are we backward.'' The dinner, expected to attract 1,200 people Friday, is a favorite campaign stop for candidates. But Republican congressional candidate <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said she had been told she would not be admitted because she is a woman, even though she bought a ticket. Other candidates subsequently said they would not show up unless women were allowed. Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, also seeking re-election this year, entered the fray Tuesday with a letter to <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> school Superintendent <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> pointing out that the dinner site, a high school in the county, is public property and anyone with a ticket must be allowed to attend. `` We all would agree <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> needed progressive changes,'' <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This is one giant step in that direction.'' The Forty & amp; Eight chapter said no one will be allowed into the event without a ticket, no tickets will be sold at the door and it will discontinue the dinners, its only fund-raising event, after this year. `` It is unfortunate that outsiders who could have directed attention to the event and what results from it instead chose to enhance their own welfare,'' the organization said. `` They should have been making statements about the good things that result from the event.'' Money from the $ 15-a-ticket dinner goes toward sponsorship of groups such as the Little League and Special Olympics, the statement said. Forty & amp; Eight, based nationally in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, began as an honorary society for American Legion members, but the groups are now separate and Legion officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> dissociated themselves from the stag affair. `` We split in 1972. We do n't even allow Forty & amp; Eight lapel pins on people in our parades, that's how much we split,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vass </PERSON>, state adjutant for the Legion. `` It's just a redneck approach,'' he said of the stag dinner. `` This is 1988! You do n't disenfranchise a congressional candidate because she's a woman.''

<HEAD>Famine-Plagued Regions Too Dangerous For Relief Workers,

<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday advised international relief agencies to remove their foreign workers from two drought-stricken northern regions because of increasing rebel violence. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> regions no longer are safe for the foreign agencies. `` In recent weeks the emergency relief aid distribution by the -LRB- commission -RRB- and international donor organizations has been disrupted by terrorists engaged in destructive activities against the unity, integrity and freedom of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>,'' the commission said in a two-page statement distributed to foreign aid groups. `` In addition to the destruction of trucks flying the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag and transportation of relief supplies, the bandits have time and again kidnapped expatriates in the regions,'' it said. The commission said foreigners should stay out of the north `` until the areas are freed from terrorist activity and tranquility is restored to the life of the civilian population in the areas.'' The government agency asked donors and international relief agencies to turn over their operations to the commission to guarantee the continuity of aid to the starving. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s food crisis is becoming more severe because there is not enough security for aid workers. `` We're naturally concerned that any diminution of the international relief effort will have a negative impact on the lives of starving people,'' she said. `` Clearly, in an unpredictable war situation, safety for relief personnel is also a serious consideration,'' she said. `` We hope that the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government will take steps to ensure the safety of relief personnel as well.'' Last week, President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> told Ethiopians in a radio address that government troops were facing a `` grim struggle'' against separatist rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the rebellions. Separatist rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and 14 years in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. The fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. Overall, nearly 7 million Ethiopians are facing famine. There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but only a few operate in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. Agencies operating in the area include the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, Doctors Without Borders of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the relief agencies in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> arrived during a 1984-85 drought and famine that killed an estimated 1 million Ethiopians. It prompted the biggest aid effort in history. Most foreign agencies pared their expatriate staffs after the 1984-85 emergency and turned over programs to Ethiopians. Exact numbers of foreign workers still in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> were not immediately available.

 The demand made by hijackers of a Kuwaiti jet is the same as that made by Moslems holding Americans hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. The Arab hijackers forced the airliner to fly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Monday. Their nationality and identity remain unknown, but speculation arose that they might be part of an Iranian-linked network of terrorists. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a small, oil-rich desert emirate caught in the crossfire of the Iran-Iraq war, refuses to free any of the 17 prisoners and reiterated Tuesday that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> will not bow to `` blackmail.'' The passengers and crew held hostage aboard <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 422 have apparently become pawns in a war between followers of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and foes of his Islamic revolution. The same could be said about <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, two Americans held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1985. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is a conservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historic rivals of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect who make up the vast majority of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> fears that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Islamic revolution will spread, inciting its <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> minority to revolt. Other Arab neighbors of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> have similar fears. Spurred by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolution and by the 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiites launched suicide bombings against the Israelis and later against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French troops who took part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Shiite extremists have targeted <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in particular over the past five years. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The 17 prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were convicted of bombings in 1983 that killed five people and wounded 86, culminating in attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Later terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> included an abortive 1985 assassination attempt on the emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>. Three of the 17 prisoners _ two Iraqis and a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> identified as <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON> _ were sentenced to death. The Shiite kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are concerned in particular about <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, whose real name is <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON>. He is a cousin of <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, believed by Western and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> intelligence to be the mastermind of Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, and other extremist Shiite factions responsible for suicide bombings, kidnappings and aircraft hijackings in recent years. Western intelligence officials believe <PERSON> Saab </PERSON> rigged the bombs used in the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> attacks. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has so far not carried out any of the executions, but that seems to have been its only concession. It has arrested dozens of other Shiites for sabotage since 1983. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movement believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His family has been long linked with the Hamadis, another <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clan involved in kidnappings. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities identified <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on charges of smuggling explosives, as two of the four Lebanese Shiites involved in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner in which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that he has stripped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of certain fishing rights because of that country's alleged violation of an international whale conservation program. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had certified the violations based on permits <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has issued for the killing of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> minke whales for research purposes. `` The sanctions are the strongest possible'' under legislation authorizing presidential action, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The administration maintains that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has run afoul of an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> whale conservation program by issuing permits for research that has never been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION>. The issuance of the permits by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to its citizens came despite a 1987 whaling commission resolution recommending that no such licenses be granted until questions about the research program were resolved, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter said. It noted that shortly after the certification of the violations by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, the whaling commission adopted a second resolution recommending that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> not go ahead with its research program. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has continued its whaling activities notwithstanding this second resolution,'' the letter said. Under provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Fishermen's Protective Act, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> directed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privileges `` that would otherwise be available to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' in waters under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authority. The current Japanese fishing quota in the 200-mile offshore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic zone is zero. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was denying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s request to fish for 3,000 metric tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> whiting. `` In addition, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be barred from any future allocations of fishing privileges for any other species, including <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> cod, until the secretary of commerce determines that the situation has been corrected,'' he said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, said the announced fishing sanctions `` would hurt some,'' but came too late to save any of the 300 minke whales <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plans to take in this year's research program. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that `` the immediate and prospective effects of a 100 percent reduction of fishing allocations, coupled with presidential review in the near future, is the most effective means of encouraging <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to embrace the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION> conservation program.'' `` Therefore, I will not impose at this time'' any sanctions against Japanese fish products imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to report by Dec. 1 on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s willingness to comply with the whaling conservation program. He also said he was directing <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to continue talks with whaling commission member countries `` to ensure that we bring to a halt all whaling that diminishes the effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION>'s conservation program.'' `` Our actions taken today and in the future should encourage all nations to adhere to the conservation programs of the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president's letter said.

 A holiday hike by Israeli teen-agers ended Wednesday in a melee of shooting and stone-throwing in an Arab town in which a 14-year-old Israeli girl and two Palestinians were killed. Hours after the clash, Jewish settlers raided the nearby Arab village of <LOCATION> Hawwara </LOCATION>, smashing car windshields, beating villagers and breaking into homes, said <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Howari </PERSON>, the Israeli-appointed head of the village council. The girl's death was the first of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian in the violence that has swept the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since Dec. 8. At least 140 Arabs have died, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, and one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier has been killed. The youngsters, children of Jewish settlers on the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, were on a Passover outing and had stopped for a picnic lunch when the trouble began with stone-throwing. Members of the group said Arabs offering to help then led them to <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>. Arabs wrestled two automatic rifles from the group's two Israeli guards but did not fire them, the army reported. Arab witnesses said the Israelis started the trouble by killing a Palestinian. Army spokesmen originally said the girl, <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, and several other teen-agers were shot but reported later that she was killed by a rock. Eleven of the 18 hikers, the 60-year-old man acting as guide and one of the two Israeli guards were injured and two Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, the army said. Dozens of settlers waving an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag later held a nighttime vigil about half a mile from <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, and said they would build a new settlement in the area. Army officials said the settlers left after several hours at the urging of troops who surrounded the village. Scores of angry settlers also demonstrated in front of Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s home and called on him to resign, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Israelis have been especially sensitive to the possibility of attacks on children, and warnings followed Wednesday's fatal confrontation. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will cut off the murderers' hands and will not let the evil terror achieve its aim.'' According to Israeli witnesses and the army, the hikers stopped for a picnic lunch in a dry riverbed just outside <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 15, said they had just sat down when a group of Arabs started throwing rocks. The Israelis left the area, but `` soon we discovered we were being followed by dozens of Arabs,'' said <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, whose right arm and chest were bandaged. He spoke from his bed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> He said some of the Arabs, apparently wanting to help, offered to lead the teen-agers out of the area through <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, a town of about 12,000 people. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the army chief of staff, said dozens of people began throwing stones at the youngsters in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> and the shooting started. He said the Israeli girl and the two Arabs were killed during the battle. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television showed CBS footage of Israeli teen-agers inside the village, some with blood stains on their faces and clothes, screaming at cameramen to call the army for help. One Israeli youngster wearing a skullcap, the tradional head cover of observant Jews, waved a red scarf at a helicopter hovering overhead as <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ambulance attendants rushed the wounded into their vehicles. A cameraman was seen consoling a girl who crouched beside a puddle of blood. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> told reporters outside <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> some residents tried to help the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> youngsters, including several women who hid three girls inside their homes. `` I want to say that within this event there were locals who tried to protect the children from the others,'' he said. `` We certainly thank those who helped.'' The army said one teen-ager was held hostage briefly, but was found by soldiers in a house-to-house search. Arab witnesses claimed the Israelis provoked the clash. They said the armed guards fired on Arabs who approached the Israelis, killing a 19-year-old Palestinian, and his angry companions then charged the hikers. `` The first man who was killed, <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseh </PERSON>, was plowing his land,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON>, 20, who said he was in the field when the fight took place. `` When people heard a farmer was killed they attacked the settlers with axes, picks and rocks. There was hand-to-hand fighting,'' he said in an interview at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Writers Strike A Month Old; Commercial Actors In Federally
Mediated Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scriptwriters enter the second month of their strike against producers with no sign of renewed talks, while advertisers and striking commercial actors met with a federal mediator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, which began March 7, has shortened the season of several television shows, caused production postponement of spring replacement series and pilot shows, and could threaten next fall's television season. In the commercial actors' strike, representatives for the combined <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> met with a federal mediator Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a session that could lead to resumption of talks. The 100,000 members of the two actors unions went on strike March 21 against the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>. The unions have since signed more than 550 interim contracts with companies that want to resume commercial production. Among them are advertising agencies for four of the presidential candidates _ Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON> said Wednesday. The unions received a letter of written support from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, which also noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not used actors in his commercials. In the writers' strike, the two sides have not met since a March 10 federally mediated session, and there are no immediate prospects of resumed negotiations. Informal talks two weeks ago between guild executive director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and the producers' chief negotiator, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON>, failed to bring results. Meanwhile, scores of independent producers and some members of the alliance have requested separate negotiations with the guild. There have been no agreements reached as a result of those talks, guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. The majority of those seeking independent contracts with the guild are television production companies, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> confirmed, but she denied that reaching any agreement with them would create a rift between working television writers and still-striking movie writers. `` If there were an independent agreement, and that is a very big ` if,' it would have to be responsive to all our members' needs,'' she said. `` Just because someone is doing a television show now does n't mean they might not pick up a movie project next.'' A rift between television and movie writers during a 1985 strike by the Writers Guild caused confusion and rancor among the members. During that strike, television writers felt they were being forced on strike to support movie writers seeking higher residuals from videocassette sales. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said there were no plans to picket next Monday's Academy Awards show, although the guild will be monitoring it to make sure no violations occur with the guild-written script for the three-hour broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The script was about 90 percent complete when writers went on strike. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> also said the guild offered no guidelines on whether striking members who have received nominations should show up for the awards. `` We are leaving it up to them,'' she said. Producers representatives have said several times that they are standing by their last and final offer made at the start of the strike. The Sherman Oaks-based alliance has said its proposal would raise writers' pay by $ 50 million over three years, despite calling for a reduction in residual payments for some one-hour TV shows. Writers have claimed their own analysis of the offer shows it would result in a loss of more than $ 37.8 million for its 9,000 members.

<TEXT>
 Police fired tear gas and birdshot to break up an opposition demonstration in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> City Wednesday, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> completed deployment of 1,300 extra troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Hundreds of onlookers shouted insults at police who dispersed about 50 people marching to protest the economic crisis and the strongman rule of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Residents and shopkeepers hurled garbage into the streets and set fire to piles of refuse. A state-owned television station reported that two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in an Army jeep were stopped and detained by Panamanian troops near the demonstration. Major <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said the soldiers were released an hour later. In other developments Wednesday: _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition groups `` without preconditions or irreconcilable demands. _ The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said that 800 Marines would start arriving in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Friday for what it described as routine jungle training `` They will be there for three weeks and then they will come out,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the president's chief spokesman. He said the move was not related to the dispatch of troops to protect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition, which has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster for more than 10 months, sponsored a `` march against hunger'' Wednesday afternoon, but police flooded the park where it was to take place. Nonetheless, about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and began a march to the central business district. They had gone nearly a mile when police stopped them with a barrage of tear gas and birdshot. Hundreds of people jeered at the police from sidewalks and balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that enveloped blocks of Central Avenue, the main shopping thoroughfare. Many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and set fire to piles of refuse. It took more than an hour for police to restore order. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition he was not identified, said two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the case. The march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic situation that has left thousands of Panamanians penniless. Panamanians began a run on the banks in late February after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters removed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from office, and banks closed on March 4. The country's economic crisis has been exacerbated by the freezing of Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and sanctions imposed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Police halted one demonstration Tuesday with a heavy show of force and restricted another at the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> administration building. The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers arriving at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, included members of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> aviation battalion from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and military police and security specialists from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION>, Md. They were ferried to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by a fleet of C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy jet cargo planes. The aviators brought 26 helicopters, including seven powerful AH-1 Cobra gunships. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoin </PERSON> of <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, a Cobra pilot, said the mission was a training exercise, not a buildup for military action against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We've got too big a heart to be invading,'' he said. The new soldiers joined more than 10,500 American military personnel already based in the Latin American country to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> until it is turned over to the Panamanian government by treaty at the turn of the century. In ordering the buildup last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the new troops were needed to provide security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and installations because of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` heavy-handed tactics.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has called the deployment a prelude to invasion. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said he had been delegated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, to represent the general in any talks mediated by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic archbishop, Monsignor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. It was not known if the opposition would accept <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as the general's representative, since they still recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. There was no comment from the government on whether it would meet the opposition groups' conditions for talks, which include a demand that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> set an early date for his resignation. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> was asked to mediate the crisis last week by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonazalez </PERSON>, and ex-presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was dismissed by the Noriega-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in retaliation for his attempt to force the general's resignation The dismissal triggered an economic crisis that has left the government unable to pay its debts or the salaries of its 15,000 soldiers and 130,000 civilian employees.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, convening as an impeachment court for the last time, voted Wednesday to pay deposed Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s legal fees for the trial which removed him from office. `` The time has come to take the first step, extend the hand for a handshake and say this is over,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, said in requesting payment of $ 202,433.75. `` Let's start the healing process.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that he, attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> and their assistants were assured of being paid in any case. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the payment on a vote of 16-13. Several senators urged the payment as a sign of compassion, though some other senators were annoyed that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had been on national television a few hours earlier proclaiming his innocence. In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he might appeal his conviction to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session that he would have to study the legal issues before he could decide on attempting an appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> told a news conference later in the day that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s `` court of last resort'' and he ca n't appeal. Also on Wednesday, two <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> residents sued seeking to cancel the May 17 gubernatorial recall election as unnecessary. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the former secretary of state, was sworn in as <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s successor Tuesday. On Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge rejected a bid to have her name barred from the ballot in the event a recall election goes forward. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had said in his TV interview that he plans to run in the May 17 recall election if the courts rule that his name can be on the ballot. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s acting secretary of state has ordered <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s name removed pending a resolution of legal issues. `` I've never had more support,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, adding that he believed he could win the recall election. `` I'll definitely run in it unless they get it so tied up in legal technicalities,'' he said. One senator, Democrat <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` Chuy'' <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON>, cited <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s interview as grounds for not paying of his legal fees If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> were elected again, he'd probably be impeached again and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be stuck with a precedent for paying his fees, <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> said. Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, who voted against paying the fees, said the impeachment was <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s fault and `` we are not allowed to buy compassion.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, was convicted Monday on charges that he tried to thwart a death-threat investigation and misused $ 80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. He was only the seventh <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be convicted in an impeachment trial and the first to be removed from office in 59 years. The trial began. Feb. 29. The presiding officer, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, reported that attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had telephoned asking that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consider paying his bill for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense too. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had been paid in full, a total of $ 110,000. `` Frankly, I've had enough of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and his antics,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. `` He does n't belong in this body. He does n't represent the governor. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s chief attorney just before the impeachment trial. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who was said by his office to be busy meeting with a client, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. After senators passed a resolution of thanks and gave a standing ovation to <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the presiding officer asked if there were further motions. `` Mr. Presiding Officer, we urge no more motions,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>. `` We say amen.''

<HEAD>U.S. Gives Boats to Fight Cocaine Smuggling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> gave two confiscated high-speed boats to military authorities here Wednesday for use against drug traffickers. Smugglers use this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation as a transshipment point for cocaine coming in from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> seems to be determined ... that narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Imbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, the armed forces minister. He made his remarks as he and other officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> stood near the long, sleek boats, capable of speeds of more than 65 mph. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the neighboring islands of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> tightened surveillance of boats and planes. President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, elected to a fifth term in May 1986, has made the war on drugs a top priority. In December 1986, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> air force shot down a small plane that did not identify itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds of pounds of cocaine. In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at millions of dollars. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran the patrol boats of the Dominican coast guard. `` These -LRB- confiscated boats -RRB- are going to put the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> one step ahead of the smugglers,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while trying to smuggle drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. One is a 31-foot <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorpion </PERSON> with twin 235 horsepower Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he said. The value of the boats, delivered from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130s, was not disclosed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also plans to supply five small, twin-engined Cessnas to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> air force under the Military Assistance Program. Accompanying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were his wife <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>; the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for enforcement; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary; and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Andean Affairs. The stop in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s first in a Latin American tour that began Wednesday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> arrived by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet and was due to leave <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> on Thursday. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> at the National Palace, then with Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON>.

 The justice minister said the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' longest running kidnap case was solved with five arrests on Wednesday, but said the victim was `` almost certainly dead,'' Dutch television reported. Retail tycoon <PERSON> Gerrit-Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON>, 65, was kidnapped nearly seven months ago. In reporting on Justice Minister <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> <PERSON> Altes </PERSON>' announcement, the TV account gave no details on what happened to <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON> It said six suspects were arrested in a pre-dawn raid Wednesday in <LOCATION> Landsmeer </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, but one was released later in the day. The report did not identify any of the group, in line with Dutch police practice. The television report said the five were thought to hold part of a ransom of more than $ 4.3 million in cash and diamonds paid for <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON> on Nov. 27. Among those held was a 45-year old architect, whose house police staked out for weeks, the TV report said. It was there the six were arrested, it said.

A month later, the kidnappers mailed one of <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON>'s fingers to <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> as proof they were holding him. They never gave further proof <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON> was still alive. A 70-member police team was organized to solve the kidnapping. It soon imposed an information blackout on the case, which was lifted in December when authorities launched a national publicity blitz and promised a million-guilder -LRB- $ 550,000 -RRB- reward for information leading to the kidnappers' arrest. Police arrested a suspect in January but had to release him for lack of evidence.

 State authorities announced Wednesday they will make public most of files of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the 1968 assassination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, including the department's final, uncensored investigative report. The huge file, to be made public April 19, have been stored in the state archives since last August, and include some 2,500 photographs, 50,000 square feet of written material and interviews with 4,000 witnesses. Most of the material has been sealed since 1969, although a partial summary of the files was released in 1986. Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>, whose office has custody of the files, said officials will `` release all materials except those prohibited by specific laws and those which fall within another law enforcement agency's jurisdiction.'' The withheld material includes autopsy photos, juvenile records and fingerprint cards. Most of the documents to be released have never before been made public, Eu said. She added that much of the manuscript material is `` fragile and faded'' and of an `` ` irreplaceable nature.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot June 5, 1968, in the Ambassador Hotel moments after claiming victory in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary. He died the following day. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, was convicted of the killing and sentenced to die in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> gas chamber, but his death sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1972 when the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> outlawed the death penalty. He is currently imprisoned at <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION>, where he has since been denied parole numerous times since he first became eligible to apply for parole in 1975. `` The <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination by <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> was exhaustive, yet public concern about its conclusions remains 20 years later,'' <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> said in a written statement released by her office. `` In light of that concern, we believe the public's right know generally outweighs privacy concerns, and have governed our public release of these materials with that guideline.'' The files include reports of investigations of specific conspiracy theories _ <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> has since said he acted alone in killing <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ and audio and video tapes from the crime scene. The material has been stored in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> since last August, under an agreement between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the state. The agreement followed a lengthy effort by scholars and other interested persons to persuade <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officials not to keep the material secret.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Wednesday shrugged off new threats of violence by the escaped leader of a 1987 coup attempt, but other officials said the military had readied itself for possible attacks. A statement attributed to former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> vowed he would `` act boldly'' after having fled a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> Saturday. It said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> promised last November `` not to engage in hostile acts'' against the Aquino government so she could make good her promises of political reform. But the statement said it later became obvious that her administration imperiled the nation and so, `` We are now withdrawing that declaration.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said, `` I think he will have to admit that the government had adequately answered already the legitimate grievances, and I think the Filipino people definitely will go against <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. He will not be able to get support.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had been detained since Dec. 9 for last year's Aug. 28 coup attempt that left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. National Security Adviser <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s statement as `` just hot air'' but added: `` Of course, we will be in a situation of watchful waiting. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that while <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> would `` lie low for a while,'' he would `` eventually move in the direction of taking some action to destabilize the government.'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> added, `` However, the armed forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> leadership has already put into action instructions and strategies to neutralize any effort on the part of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> to contact, regroup or reconsolidate his friends or forces within the military.'' The 160,000-member armed forces was put on alert and a nationwide search was mounted for <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> after he escaped with 14 of his guards. But military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said troops found no trace of him. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> described the <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> statement as `` a call to violence'' and said he ordered the military to verify its authenticity. The statement was distributed to news agencies Wednesday. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had accused the government of being soft on communist rebels when he attempted his coup. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rebels meanwhile kidnapped town mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandayos </PERSON> and two other officials on Monday in <LOCATION> Quirino </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, the military said. On southern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, 20 raiders thought to be Moslem rebels attacked the American-owned <ORGANIZATION> Sibuco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the mountain village of <LOCATION> Camarangan </LOCATION> and killed seven workers, the military said. In the central town of <LOCATION> Himamaylan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, five family members, including three children, were killed Wednesday during what the military said was a raid on a communist hideout. A survivor denied that the families had ties to the rebels.

 Guerrillas opened fire on polling stations during national elections, killing at least three people, the government radio station reported Wednesday. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said seven other people were wounded in the attack by opposition forces in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> near the Pakistani border. The elections for 62 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 229 National Assembly seats began on Tuesday and are to run until April 14. The radio station earlier said that voting in the eastern provinces of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bamian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kapisa </LOCATION> and the district of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> was `` taking place in difficult conditions.'' It said the opposition had fired on some voting centers in these areas, which are under the control of communist government forces. The Moslem guerrillas claim to control about 80 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, most of it outside the big cities. One-fourth of the seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> are being set aside for the rebel candidates even if they do not participate, the government says. The insurgents have not commented officially on the elections, which are the first since the communists seized power 10 years ago. Guerrilla officials speaking privately dismissed them as a farce. Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the vote is meaningless at a time when peace talks are taking place in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is reportedly preparing to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Since the beginning of the elections, extremist opposition elements have attacked homes and residences with heavy arms. Their inhuman action was repeated today,'' Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said. It said a number of houses were destroyed, but gave no further details. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> cast his vote Tuesday, when about 147,300 people out of the 955,000 registered to vote cast ballots, the radio said. The communist party came to power in an April 1978 coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to help the faltering government fight the anti-communist Moslem guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have supported the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Simon Set To Suspend Campaign For Democratic Presidential
Nomination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is expected to suspend his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday but will remain an official if inactive candidate, his mother confirmed Wednesday night. `` He is not dropping out,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 83, of <LOCATION> Collinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Too many people have advised him to stay in, and that's what he is going to do.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> himself has been mum about his plans. The Illinois senator said before Tuesday's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary that he would have to reassess his campaign if he did not do well. He placed a distant fourth behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` He is just suspending his campaign,'' in part because of the high cost of media advertising, Mrs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told radio station <ORGANIZATION> WRYT </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edwardsville </LOCATION>. But, she said, `` He's going to hang in there till the end.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who said her son called her Tuesday night, said he planned a week's vacation with his family. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign suspension meant he would not seek to participate in campaign debates scheduled in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before that state's April 19 primary. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreloff </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaign's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> legal counsel, said Wednesday night that he could not confirm what <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would say in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference scheduled for Thursday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s remaining in the race, even as an inactive candidate, would allow him to garner more delegates before the Democratic National Convention in July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and hang on to those he has. Under party rules and because of their showings in the March 15 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is entitled to 13 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> none. A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is now behind in the delegate count. Those 47 would be enough to put him ahead. <PERSON> Kreloff </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> suspends active campaigning, instead of dropping out of the race, it would be understandable. `` If, in fact, that's what he does, it would seem to be a sensible position, given that there is no clear favorite,'' <PERSON> Kreloff </PERSON> said. `` I think it's the fairest thing to do for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters who voted March 15 ... so the delegates reflect what the voters wanted.'' While an inactive <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaign could block <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from garnering the 47 at-large delegates <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> will get, one <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> backer said Wednesday she does not think the senator is engaging in a `` stop-Jackson'' movement. `` That's just not <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Luellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurenti </PERSON> of Normal, an elected <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> delegate and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I still think that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wants to be ... in a position to have a little leverage in the outcome of this thing and the outcome of the platform,'' Ms. <PERSON> Laurenti </PERSON> said. `` I think he does have a vision and he does have an internal passion. He just has trouble showing it on the outside. `` There are just too many important things that need to be decided ... for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to say ` I'm throwing in the towel now. He has a right to have some say,'' she said.

 A French mediator met with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister Wednesday and said there were signs that French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be freed shortly <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitterlin </PERSON>, a former Gaullist parliament deputy who heads a pro-Arab lobbying group, talked for an hour with Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia. `` There are encouraging signals, as I gathered from Minister <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, that an adequate solution for the issue of the French hostages would be achieved shortly,'' <PERSON> Bitterlin </PERSON> told reporters without elaborating. He said the discussions focused on the fate of at least three Frenchmen held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad underground faction. It was the first time <PERSON> Bitterlin </PERSON> declared publicly he was involved in efforts to free the hostages. He has made at least three negotiating trips to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since December.

The kidnappings were claimed by Islamic Jihad or Holy War, a group of Shiite Moslems loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bitterlin </PERSON> had said during previous trips that he was negotiating the release of eight Europeans seized last year by a radical Palestinian guerrilla faction headed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. He said he had not discussed that case Wednesday with <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> warned the Contra rebels Wednesday that if cease-fire talks break down, the government will begin a major military offensive. `` If the Contras do n't accept the agreements, the people must be ready for combat and ... launch an offensive with all available force to be rid of -LRB- the Contras -RRB- once and for all and not prolong the war,'' he said in remarks carried on the state radio, Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, the radio reported that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> military representatives agreed on seven zones where rebels will gather during their 60-day cease-fire. The two sides remained far apart, however, on key issues to bring about a permanent peace. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> launched an offensive against the Contras in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. On President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s orders, 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops flew to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on March 17-18 after Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had invaded his country in pursuit of Contras. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops never saw action and returned home at the end of March. Wednesday's meeting in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, the fourth set of talks in less than a month, dealt with the mechanics of pursuing the truce which went into effect Friday. The Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, broadcasting from <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, said boundaries were set for two zones in the north, two in central <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, two on the remote <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast and one in the south. `` Just about all the details were defined about the location and dimension of the zones, but tomorrow the method of operation will be discussed,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacayo </PERSON>, chief of the Sandinista delegation, said in a broadcast interview after discussions recessed for the day. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> is chief of staff of the Sandinista army. The Contras are to gather in the zones during the first 15 days of April. It still must be decided how to provide security assurances for the rebels and how humanitarian assistance can be delivered to them. On March 23, the two sides formally agreed to the truce as part of a plan to end a war that killed or wounded an estimated 50,000 people over nearly seven years. Neither the leftist Sandinista government nor the Nicaraguan Resistance, the U.S.-supported Contra rebel organization, says it is satisfied with the other side's compliance with the accord. Contra leaders accused the Sandinistas of violating a section of the pact that calls for `` unrestricted freedom of expression'' by failing to supply newsprint to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> called the newsprint restriction `` a deliberate blow to freedom of expression in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The accord also called for the release of 100 political prisoners on March 27. The Contras complain the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> freed only 10 of the prisoners the rebels had on their list, although the pact does not specify the rebels have a say in who goes free. Issues still pending include how and when the Contras will lay down their weapons. This is not spelled out in the plan, nor does the plan say what will happen to the Contras after they gather in the zones. Under the plan, the government pledges `` that the individuals who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life will be able to take part in future elections.'' But `` normal civilian life'' is open to interpretation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the government claims to have 300,000 people under arms. The Contras backed out of a high-level meeting `` to continue definitive cease-fire negotiations,'' originally set for Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital. They said the meeting must wait until security issues for the rebels were resolved. The two sides are arguing about an agenda for the next meeting, as well as a date. In addition, the Contras insist that their 55-member delegation stay at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s downtown Intercontinental Hotel and be free to meet with political opposition leaders. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambrana </PERSON>, head of reservations at the hotel, said Wednesday the Contras have reserved 50 rooms for April 12-15. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have said that for security reasons the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation would be housed at a hotel near the airport.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hired at least one company linked to earlier drug smuggling to transport aid to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and was put in touch with the company by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, according to congressional testimony and sources. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in early 1986 signed a series of contracts totaling more than $ 300,000 with Vortex, a small <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> air transport and service company, to airlift `` humanitarian'' aid to the rebels, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an admitted former drug pilot who then worked for Vortex, said Wednesday. The company was unprepared to handle the volume of supplies the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wanted transported and had to rent a larger warehouse to accommodate the job, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee. Vortex also did airplane maintenance work for <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> proprietary companies resupplying the Contras in 1987, and in late 1986 sold the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> supply operation a DC-6 that formerly had been used to haul drugs, according to his testimony and committee staff members. Investigators for the congressional Iran-Contra committees have told the narcotics panel that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> selected Vortex from a list of transport companies provided by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee source, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` If the Contra delivery system is using known narcotics dealers -LRB- for airlifts -RRB-, it's no wonder you have confusion surrounding the policy,'' said subcommittee chairman Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. It was unclear whether the department knew that it was hiring a company with drug links to undertake part of the resupply operation. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duemling </PERSON>, who ran the <ORGANIZATION> NHAO </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to testify before the panel on Thursday. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the arrangement illustrated `` the absurdity, not to mention the impropriety, of a government contract going to someone -LRB- with drug involvement -RRB-, handing out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer dollars to support their business.'' `` Something's wrong here,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` A contractor to <ORGANIZATION> NHAO </ORGANIZATION>, flying in an ex-drug plane, working simultaneously in narcotics undercover and supplying goods to the Contras.'' But <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said that was part of the reality of drug enforcement efforts. He said agencies do n't have the money to own their own aircraft for undercover operations or the desire to undertake such risky ventures themselves. `` Enter sf a $ 27 million <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> effort to deliver non-lethal supplies to the Contras, authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> later sharply criticized the operation, saying large amounts of the aid could not be accounted for. Wednesday's hearing was part of a continuing series of sessions <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said are intended to alert the public and policymakers to the pervasiveness of drug trading throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Later witnesses, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, will establish even stronger links between drug trafficking and resupply efforts for the Contras. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was arrested on marijuana smuggling charges in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986 along with others, while working for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and acting at the same time as an informant for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Others charged at that time were convicted, but <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s indictment was dropped because of his role in helping the government, he testified. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said the decision to drop charges against him was made locally, in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and was due to circumstances surrounding an undercover operation, and did not involve <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> higher-ups or the Contra connection. But <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said there had been a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting about disposition of <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s case and that the question of who prompted his release remained open.

 The hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet released 32 more passengers in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> early Thursday, but warned that those remaining would be in danger if authorities failed to meet the hijackers' demands, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported. The release left about 50 passengers and crew members aboard the plane. The hijackers warned in a statement that three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family who are still aboard the aircraft would pay a dear price if the conditions were not fulfilled, the agency reported. The release of the 32 additional passengers came a day after the hijackers freed 25 hostages _ one ailing man and 24 women. The gunmen are demanding the release of 17 Shiite Moslems convicted and imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in 1983. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayyeri </PERSON> told Iranian television Wednesday that talks on the emergency were under way between <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials who flew to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and officials of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government. The kidnappers, however, accused the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation of wasting its time, and asked the Iranians to mediate between the hijackers and Kuwaitis, reported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. In their statement, the hijackers also warned Iranian security forces not to take any action against the plane and the hijackers, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency quoted the hijackers as saying in a statement that they wanted the world to realize `` the real nature of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the Muslim world, at the top of them the issue of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and the brave Palestinians who are fighting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The hijackers said they would free any hostage they thought had nothing to do with the issues involved, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported, but keep the others and treat them in such a way as `` to settle our account'' with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. In a conversation with the airport control tower later, the hijackers said they were considering releasing all non-Kuwaiti passengers, the agency said. Thirty Kuwaitis were on the passenger list. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the 32 people released at 2:30 a.m. Thursday -LRB- 7 p.m. Wednesday EDT -RRB- included two crew members, a Sudanese and a Yemenite. All those freed were brought to the transit lounge of <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport and were under medical care, it added. It added that immediately after the release the hijackers closed the doors and switched off the lights in the aircraft cabin. The hijackers earlier insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 be refueled. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted airport authorities at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as saying they would refuel the plane `` to prevent any calamity or incident.'' Food was brought Wednesday to those still aboard the jet. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a freed Jordanian passenger as saying there were five or six hijackers, who wore masks and were armed with pistols and hand grenades. There originally were 112 people on the plane. Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> presided at an emergency meeting of the Kuwaiti Cabinet on Tuesday night and said the government would not submit to `` blackmail.'' Relatives have identified the royal prisoners as two sisters in their early 30s, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, and brother <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, described as a businessman in his 40s. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> praised the sheikdom for refusing to yield, declaring: `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has taken an exemplary position in the struggle against international terrorism, and we applaud them for it.'' Twelve Britons were on the plane before the release early Thursday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she would not ask <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to negotiate, and told reporters: `` We do not give in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies.'' In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, senior military spokesman <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON> told a news conference attended by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter the `` hijackers' identity is still not known to us. We only know that they speak Arabic and want the prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to be freed.'' Five flight attendants among the women released Wednesday said a masked man brandishing a pistol announced the hijack in English as the plane flew over <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Tuesday. A physician identified only as Dr. <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> was sent to the aircraft Wednesday at the request of the hijackers. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying he treated two Arabic-speaking women, and the condition of one was `` not satisfactory.'' A passenger list released in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, where Flight 422 originated, indicated the only two women left on the plane were the members of the royal family. The hijackers freed 24 women early Wednesday after 20 hours in captivity and Jordanian businessman <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, 42, who suffers from a heart condition, was released Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Release of the 17 jailed Shiites has been a recurring demand of Shiite fundamentalist groups, loyal to Iranian <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many acts of terrorism in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been blamed on Shiite Moslems acting for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of being its enemy's ally. No precise list of the nationalities of the remaining hostages was available because of differences in lists released by <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> and the airline.

<HEAD>Don't Jump To Conclusions About Low Jobless Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Do n't jump to easy conclusions about those falling jobless rates. The picture is n't nearly as clear as it has been made to appear. A rush of analyses and a spate of media stories followed the announcement last week that the civilian unemployment rate had fallen to 5.6 percent of the labor force, the lowest since May 1979. Speculation developed that the economy was overheating, that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be forced into a tougher monetary policy and even that a shortage of workers might endanger some companies. The news is n't that sharply defined, however. Seldom has the job situation been more complicated, showing signs of both economic strength and weakness at the same time. Evidence of a very strong economy is suggested by this example: _ More than 5 million jobs have been created in the past two years, and expectations for further improvement are showing up in surveys, such as that conducted quarterly by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. _ This improvement in the numbers has come in spite of hiring hold-downs by some large corporations, and a serious effort by major companies to eliminate entire layers of white-collar bureaucracy. But there is another side to the story. Not all the improvement in the jobless rate can be attributed to economic strength. Much of what appears to be strength is simply the result of a reduced rate of labor force expansion. The dramatic surge of women into the labor market that took place in the 1960s and 1970s has abated. In addition, the birth rate decline in those same decades results in fewer young people entering the labor force now. The slowing of labor force growth, therefore, makes the falling jobless numbers look better than they are. But there are other inconsistencies and oddities, too, and they create uncertainty about almost any interpretation of jobless statistics. Operators of retail outlets in some areas of the country are begging for part-time workers, but the outlook for this year's college graduates is n't as good as it was a couple of years ago Employers are said to be more selective. Though service industries are big hirers, adding 85,000 jobs in March alone, in the same month no overall job growth took place in the nation's factories. In fact, small declines occurred in 11 industries. And, in spite of the low and delcining jobless figures, the number of discouraged workers actually rose in the first quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> now includes one million in that status, higher than last year. Adding to the difficulty of analyzing employment numbers is still another problem: a big difference in the two surveys _ one a measure of payrolls, the other a survey of households _ used by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The business survey found a seasonally adjusted rise of 260,000 in payroll employment from February to March. The household survey showed a seasonally adjusted decline both in the labor force and employment. What does it mean? The consensus seems to be that the job market is strong, so strong it could contribute to inflation. A strong market tends to push up wages. It means the hiring of less productive workers, also inflationary. One of the immediate consequences of that interpretation is talk around Wall Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates and that, in turn, stock prices could be forced lower. Perhaps wiser heads are biding their time, however, knowing that numbers such as these do n't reveal their secrets quickly, but only over a more extended time. End Adv PMs Wednesday April 6

<HEAD>For Temporary Relief From Tax Pressure, Take Form 4868</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Internal Revenue Service Form 4868 is surely a popular piece of paper right now. For those who have not yet had occasion to use it, 4868 is the document taxpayers must file by April 15 to get an automatic extension of the deadline on their federal tax returns. Such extensions are in heavy demand this year, with taxpayers and paid preparers struggling to adjust to the new system that went into effect in 1987 mandated by tax reform. Confusion has been running high about many provisions of the new code, even among professional veterans of the tax wars. Suppose, for example, that you have `` passive losses'' from some partnership activity. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> recently released 265 pages of temporary passive loss regulations, and this is only the beginning,'' observed the <ORGANIZATION> J.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in its current monthly bulletin. If you are overwhelmed by tax questions, preoccupied by other pressing matters or simply in a mood to procrastinate, you can put off the deadline for completing your return until Aug. 15 by simply filing Form 4868 now. For this extension, unlike any subsequent one you might seek, the government does n't require any explanation or excuse. But if Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has any money coming from you, he wants it now, not later. The rules require that you include with Form 4868 a check for the estimated balance of what you still owe, beyond what was withheld from your wages or salary and any other payments you have already made. The estimate should be made with some care. If it turns out that you still owe money for 1987 when you file your return on, say, June 30, the government will charge you interest at a 10 percent annual rate on the balance due. And if what you still owe amounts to more than 10 percent of your total tax bill for the year, a penalty may also be imposed. Although it is a helpful option to have, an extension is not always an unmixed blessing. For one thing, if you have a refund coming, you ca n't claim it with Form 4868. That has to wait until your return is filed. And in the interim the government has what amounts to the free use of the money. That cost may be a small one to pay, however, if an extension allows you or your professional preparer the breathing space necessary to make a careful computation of every tax break to which you are entitled. Extensions are also automatically granted, without a Form 4868, for two months if you can document that you were out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on April 15. But a quick dash across the border and back will no longer do the trick. Nettled by an airline's advertisements touting foreign travel as a tax dodge, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> recently said these extensions apply only to people who can show that they were out of the country for at least 14 consecutive days, including all of April 15. Does an extension in any form increase, or reduce, your chances of getting audited? Probably not, says the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some tax experts contend that you should request the maximum extension allowed for filing your return, arguing that the chances of an audit are reduced since <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> field agents will have less time to conduct the audit,'' the accounting firm says. `` Other tax experts contend you're better off filing on April 15 since this way you get lost in the crowd. Both theories are oversimplifications of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> procedures.''

<BYLINE>Is Housing Affordability Really Increasing?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Encouraged by studies showing housing affordability has improved, a result of rising incomes and lower interest rates, many young couples are seeking to buy their first houses this spring. `` Now is as good a time as ever to buy a home,'' says <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, because `` conditions over the last few months are the best of the decade.'' He points to an affordability reading of 113, meaning a family earning the median income of $ 31,384 had 113 percent of the income needed to qualify for a conventional 80 percent loan on an existing median-price home of $ 88,300. That's one point of view, and it is well-supported by the evidence. However, it applies only to those who manage to come up with the 20 percent down payment, which in some parts of the country can mean a lot of cash. There's another viewpoint: No matter what the affordability measures say, it is still going to be difficult for most first-time buyers - those who seek to put down only 10 percent or 15 percent _ to get the house of their choice. Those who say that have been observing a growing phenomenon, a tendency for mortgage lenders to seek higher downpayments from their customers, thus obliterating the good news coming from housing and real estate people. Because of the surge in housing prices over the past half-decade, two big obstacles face first-time buyers. First, they must have sufficient money for the down payment; secondly, they must be able to afford carrying costs. While two incomes help solve the second of these challenges, these incomes might have very little impact on the problem, that of amassing the down payment. Young people have a tough time saving, for reasons well known to everybody. Recognizing this, the market responded with extremely low down payments, made possible in part by mortgage insurance that reduced the lender's risk. As a result, many buyers were able to get by with 10 percent down, or even less. As it turns out, however, what was good for the homebuyer was not always so for the private mortgage insurance industry. Real estate prices have actually fallen in some areas, eroding the owner's tiny equity. In some instances, owners of houses with insured mortgages have found when they sold that they had insufficient money to pay off the mortgage. That being so, some mortgage companies have experienced a surge of claims. The response of such insurers is to seek customers who make larger initial payments. And, with prices in many communities double or triple the national median, that can mean a sum beyond the abilities of most young couples. The insistence by lenders that buyers obtain mortgage insurance, and the insistance by mortgage insurers that the buyer make a larger down payment, tends to offset the impact of lower interest rates and a variety of mortgages. It leaves the first-time homebuyer in a tough spot, which is nothing new, as the statistics show. In 1986, according to the Realtors, the home ownership rate fell to 63.8 percent from 65.6 percent in 1980. For those in the prime homebuying ages of 25 to 43 years, the descent was sharper, to 45.4 percent from 55 percent. Sympathy for young couples is n't universal, however. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Roehrick </PERSON>, 75, of <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, offers a comment typical for many members of his generation: `` When we got married in 1937 no young married could buy a home _ only those over 50 owned them, as now. The young marrieds had to save for 15 years just for a down payment. `` All over the country homes by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and others for $ 15,000 up are going begging for owners, because young people do n't have the guts to start at the bottom, buy a shack, fix it up and sell it.''

<HEAD>Mainline Denomination Abandoning Pro-Choice Abortion Stand</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mainline American denomination, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, is backing away from its support of abortion rights, officials indicated this week. It was the first such definitive shift projected among the larger, socially activist Protestant bodies. Similar reassessments have come in some other major denominations, either stiffening opposition to abortion, or qualifying acceptance of it. But some still take an essentially pro-choice position. The turn away from it planned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> stemmed both from simmering discontent with the past stance and the swelling tide of abortions in the country. `` The great proliferation of abortion has made us stop and look at what's happening here,'' says <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, head of a task force which has been re-examining the issue for more than two years. `` It's a process of reevaluation and reassessment,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` This is a continuing necessity if the church is to carry out its prophetic role on such a key social issue.'' She said positions ca n't be fixed `` in concrete,'' but `` are pulled along by social changes on the issue and as we understand more about it.'' She termed the projected new stand `` responsibility to choose life.'' It attempts a path-breaking middle ground. `` It is a pro-life stance in affirming the sacredness of life as a gift of God,'' she said. But it avoids both the `` pro-life'' and `` pro-choice'' terms commonly used in the polarized conflict over abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a former missionary in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and wife of a minister, said: `` We've sought a different vocabulary for dealing with a very complex subject. We've tried to find a common ground for ministering to people about it.'' The newly prepared statement, expected to be approved in a final presentation to a policy-making general board in June, acknowledges keen diversity among the denomination's 1.6 million members on the issue. Howevever, the statement breaks with the previous 1981 stand, which saw abortion in terms of religious liberty as a `` matter of responsible personal choice.'' The new document, recognizing `` life as a sacred and gracious gift of God,'' says: `` As American Baptists we oppose abortion, as a means of avoiding responsibility for conception, as a primary means of birth control, without regard for the far-reaching consequences of the act. `` We denounce irresponsible sexual behavior and acts of sexual violence that contribute to the large number of abortions each year. `` We grieve with all who struggle with the difficult circumstances that lead them to consider abortion. Recognizing that each person is ultimately responsible to God, we encourage women and men in these circumstances to seek spiritual counsel as they prayerfully and conscientiously consider their decision.'' A sister church, the larger 14.6-million Southern Baptist Convention, takes a firmly anti-abortion position, toughening that stand in 1984 to ask for laws prohibiting all abortion except to `` save the physical life of the mother.'' Changes also have come among more liberal mainline bodies, including: The Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- in 1985 qualified its acceptance of choice in the matter, opposing abortion `` as a method of birth control'' or for `` convenience or to ease embarrassment.'' The Church of the Brethren in 1984 explicitly condemned abortion, after previously taking a more pastoral view of it. The former <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, now merged into the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in 1980 sharpened its rejection of abortion, saying it destroys life, and urged laws protecting it `` from conception to birth.'' Numerous denominations have steadily rejected abortion, including Eastern Orthodox churches, Roman Catholicism, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, Mormons and conservative evangelical denominations. However, several mainline bodies, such as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB-, uphold choice about abortion, and the legalizing of it. The seven-member American Baptist task force, including three supporters of legalized abortion, three opponents and one undetermined about it, has held hearings across the country, gathered questionaires and a flood of letters. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mild </PERSON>, staff assistant on the project at the denomination's headquarters in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said there has been some discontent with the previous stance of 1981 `` Enough people were not happy'' with it as `` reflecting where we really are,'' she said. The revision expresses no opinion of the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, neither for nor against, but condemns harassing either abortion clinics or doctors refusing to do abortions. The seven-page statement stresses education and ministry to reinforce responsible sexuality, to help those facing problem pregnancies and to provide needed financial aid to women carrying such pregnancies to birth. While not citing any circumstances that justify abortion, as was done previously, the new statement urges a ministry of `` love and spiritual counsel to those who choose to terminate their pregnancies.''

 <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> focuses on the blackboard with absorbed frustration. Reporters and photographers have invaded his classroom, and he's concerned his students are losing their concentration. Although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the subject of the critically acclaimed film `` Stand and Deliver,'' <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has more important things on his mind _ like mathematics and helping his <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students to learn as much as they can. `` We have so many people working at <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> in the Box -LRB- fast-food restaurants -RRB- and pumping gas,'' he said. Like the movie teacher portrayed by actor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> wants more for his students, and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their ticket out of menial jobs. `` It's like a sport,'' he said. `` You have to practice every day to be in shape.'' His scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical athletes. Photos show beaming students holding banners heralding their achievements. Each year the number of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> students passing the Advanced Placement calculus test, given by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for college credit, has grown tremendously. In 1979, five students took the test and all had a passing mark of 3 or better. By last year, 87 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students passed the test, higher than any other school in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The movie concerns an incident in 1982, when 18 students took the exam and all passed. Surprised that the predominantly Hispanic class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its academic accreditation, the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> accused the students of cheating. Twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of 5 or near perfect scores of 4. Last year, scores made by <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students taking the Advanced Placement calculus test placed <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> second in the nation out of the 4,197 schools with students taking the tough exam, said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gams </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Just 2 percent of American students even attempt the test. This year, a record 160 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students are expected to take the test, and <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has set his sights on attracting even more students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to continue teaching. `` He's your friend, he's your mentor and he's your father,'' said former student <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richkarday </PERSON>, who was one of the 18 students suspected of cheating. `` He just did n't teach,'' said <PERSON> Richkarday </PERSON>, 23, who is studying to be a math teacher herself. `` He brought something out of me. If you're willing to go 50 yards, he'll go 100.'' <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has seen `` Stand and Deliver'' four times and likes it, although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype because the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release depicts more gang activity than really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more destitute than they really are. His students have become doctors and engineers. They work at the <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, which does work for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and for <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Islas </PERSON>, a 1976 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> graduate and an oral surgeon with two offices in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, credits <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> with challenging him to be more than a C student with athletic talent `` He was a fantastic instructor,'' <PERSON> Islas </PERSON> said. `` He kept you motivated, and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but I think in that particular environment that's what you needed.'' In the 14 years <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has been at <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION>, he has watched the gang influence dissipate, due mostly to a tough line by school administrators and teachers. The graffiti is more or less gone. And, thanks in part to the reputation of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s math achievers, the school is respected within the mostly Hispanic barrio, where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride. The days when students did n't want to go to <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION> are over, said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tostado </PERSON>, who grew up in the area. `` There's no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what you do you're not going to get ahead,'' she said. Today, the school is well-known for academic prowess. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, a 57-year-old father of two sons, was a respected teacher in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> for 11 years before coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at his wife's urging in 1964. Once here, he tried a career in computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching. `` I got real tired,'' he said in an interview. `` I did n't want to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics.'' Now he spends his days in a stage-like arena before as many as 52 students who sit on tiered rows, and demands that late comers get `` The Chair,'' a tot's seat meant to embarrass tardy students into promptness. His classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate. A foot-high banner curls around the room's corners, greeting students with: `` Calculus need not be made easy; it is easy already.'' Another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if they master math: `` Feel ready to attend any college or university. Feel prepared to go into real estate, business, engineering. Feel really good about myself.'' The students do feel good about themselves. Boredom is replaced with laughter, smiles and friendly jests, as <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> tries to reach them through cheers, swats them with a battered and faded pillow, practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically anything to promote learning. He was given the nickname `` <PERSON> Kimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabe </PERSON>'' by four gang toughs in his class. The name translates loosely from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> as `` the one who knows.'' He's accepted the nickname, but shakes off such glorious titles as `` American hero,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> dubbed him in a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it. `` What I tried to do is improve things in my school,'' he said. `` He's a master,'' said <PERSON> Tostado </PERSON>, describing <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s teaching `` He's a genius at it.'' News crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now, but while the media intrusion disturbs him, <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> believes the rewards from the movie's exposure will offset the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> glare. `` It's going to motivate parents to control, to help ... because the schools alone can not educate,'' he said. `` It's going to motivate the students. The teachers are going to see it's better to teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk.''

 The working class neighborhood that taught <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> respect for humanity and watched the `` Miami Vice'' star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his latest movie. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> returned to an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high school last spring to make `` Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about a magnetic, demanding math teacher who led an unruly Hispanic class to academic triumph in 1982. The 41-year-old actor was no stranger to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. His cousin teaches computer science there. Only 1 -LCB- miles from his childhood home, it is ethnically mixed, like the neighborhood he remembers. `` Stand and Deliver'' was a smash when it opened in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It brought in $ 411,000 during its first week last month, averaging $ 14,000 at each of 30 theaters, he said. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, an actor of <PERSON> Mexican-American </PERSON> heritage who won an Emmy Award for his role as Lt. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series `` Miami Vice,'' was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home area. `` This film is probably the most inspirational film I've done to date,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release. `` Stand and Deliver'' is about overcoming racial stigmas. It advances the humanities, something <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> said he holds close to his heart; something he learned in a family of eight living in a neighborhood crowded with <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, Mexican, Jewish and American Indian families. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, who co-produced and helped write the movie, claims he is not making a political point. `` I'm not a political animal,'' he said. It's the advancement of the humanities through acting that inspires <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>. `` It's always been that way. It serves me well and makes me stronger,'' he said. `` That does n't mean I have to make message movies. I think that art forms, especially films, should be used to entertain. Now if by chance your entertaining and allowing -LRB- your audience -RRB- to experience an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness to it, well even better. `` The criterion, No. 1, is the story. If that story happens to be socially relevant, well that's wonderful, but if it is n't, that's OK too.'' `` Stand and Deliver'' is about an event that drew national attention to <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 1982 calculus class. The predominantly Hispanic class took and passed an Advance Placement calculus test, in stark contrast to the rest of the school, which faced loss of accreditation. The 18 students, who were badgered and inspired by computer specialist-turned-teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, were stripped of their honors when the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which tests <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students and provides their scores to colleges and universities, accused the entire class of cheating. In the movie, <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, in his role as <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, accuses the Educational Testing Service of racism. Students from wealthy <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> would not be questioned if they passed an Advance Placement calculus test, but students with Hispanic names from a barrio high school were suspect, he says in the movie. Eventually, the students are vindicated with a second test. The movie is not meant to be manipulative, <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> said. It presents an event `` that allows you to experience with your own values.'' `` We do n't give results,'' he said. `` We only give the facts.''

 The 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> is more than a technology buff's dream come true. It's an impressive road car and comfortable large sedan that even a techno-phobe can appreciate. Inside the aerodynamically styled vehicle, a driver can tune the radio without taking his hands off the steering wheel. The radio buttons are built into the wheel, around the horn. An electronic compass senses the earth's magnetic field. Thus, changes in the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION>'s direction are continuously displayed on an electronic map on the dashboard. And a new, smooth, fuel-injected 3800 V6, wonderfully firm suspension, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> GT +4 radial tires and antilock brakes join to provide stable road handling and enjoyable ride Yes, the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> is a car to show off to friends and neighbors. But it does n't come cheaply. Base price is $ 21,879. You get what you pay for: The <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> is so loaded with standard equipment there are only three options -LRB- alarm system, interior leather and power sunroof -RRB-. Additionally, the SSE is priced below many of its foreign competitors, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000, which starts at more than $ 22,000, and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> 760, which starts around $ 31,200. New for the 1988 model year, the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> is the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> line which was redesigned inside and out for the 1987 model year. The lowest-priced <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, the LE, has a base price of $ 14,099 and nearly the same stylish exterior as the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> but without the fancy handling package and technology frills. There's also a middle offering _ the <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> SE </LOCATION> that starts at $ 16,299 and shares the new 3.8-liter V6 with the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION> but not the same suspension. <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, expects to build only 14,000 Bonneville SSEs this model year, and spokesman <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says, `` We expect to sell them all with no problem. The initial reception to the car has been great, exceeding our forecast.'' <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> projects total Bonneville sales this model year of 110,000, up from 93,575 in the 1987 model year, he added. Bonnevilles rank third in volume at <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, behind the Grand Am and Pontiac 6000 models. The majority of buyers targeted for the 1988 <PERSON> Bonnevilles </PERSON> are male and married, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> says. Average age is 49 for the LE and 45 for the <ORGANIZATION> SSE </ORGANIZATION>.

At night, the dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree because of all the electronics and buttons, including those for automatic heat and air conditioning. However, one of the buttons for setting interior temperature sometimes stuck. An electronic screen on the dashboard indicated when the next oil change, tire rotation and tune-up were needed and monitored doors and the trunk to make sure they were secured. But I drove 5 miles with the trunk ajar, and no warning appeared on the screen. The 10-way, adjustable front bucket seats were roomy and had countless comfortable settings, including three buttons for power lumbar support at three different spots in the back of the seats. But the power headrests were bulkier than I was used to and I found myself craning to look around them when backing up. Still, the trunk was flat and spacious, and the <LOCATION> Delco </LOCATION> sound system was superb. There was comfortable seating in the rear, and a rear arm rest-console provided a spot for beverages and storage if only two people rode back there. However, because the model is so new, Consumer Reports does not yet have repair records.

 Interest rates are not headed skyward despite a slight uptick in recent weeks, economists say. Interest rates rise when lenders become fearful of inflation, but so far inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly strong economic growth, a number of economists interviewed Tuesday said. Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, roughly the same as they have for the past three years. And that has allowed Americans to enjoy a rare combination of fairly robust growth and slowly rising prices.

 Oil futures prices have skidded below the $ 17-a-barrel range following a Kuwaiti news report that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing committee would not recommend a full ministerial conference of the cartel at its April 9 meeting On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May delivery price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 22 cents per barrel to $ 16.79 on Tuesday. Most of the drop came in the afternoon, but volume was relatively light. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale No. 2 heating oil fell 0.80 cent a gallon to 45.20 cents, and unleaded gasoline fell 0.71 cent a gallon to 48.64 cents. The oil market has been focusing on Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price and production policies because of a persistent output glut and widespread reports of cheating among the cartel's 13 members on their self-imposed production limits. The April 9 meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> had incited some hope that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production discipline to limit excessive supplies. Traders said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> news report dampened the optimism and forced a selloff in the futures market. But they said the light volume of trading suggested most oil market participants are reluctant to buy or sell pending the outcome of the price committee meeting. The committee has no power to alter <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> policy but it can call for a full ministerial meeting, considered its strongest option.

 <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funk </ORGANIZATION>'s grass has shimmered in the Rose Bowl, in Yankee Stadium, on the Masters golf course and across thousands of private lawns. He's got a famous touch with turf, but the 59-year-old researcher and academician says the grass is always greener somewhere else. `` You start out with a variety and then immediately start working on a replacement that's better, because nothing is perfect,'' he said. Colleagues and others involved in the turf industry say <ORGANIZATION> Funk </ORGANIZATION> has taken an unknown field and made it his own, revolutionizing the development of grass and gaining international prominence in the process. A <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher and turf science professor, <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> has been developing scores of grass varieties for more than 20 years. In his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> offices and on 200 acres of test fields in <LOCATION> Adelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> combines various strains of grass seed in search of the best combination. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> has created fine-textured turf grasses, lush dark green grasses, shade and drought-tolerant grasses, and grasses that repel disease and insects, bearing such names as Rebel, Gator and Prelude. `` He is often referred to as the <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> of the seed industry,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Lofts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` There is nobody, probably in the world, who is as knowledgeable on new varieties in the turf grass industry.'' <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, who has done business with and consulted <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> for about 20 years, said <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>'s students are courted heavily by the grass seed industry because of his track record. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>'s work and the work of students and faculty in the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> soils and crops department at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> have kept hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties flowing into the university's turf research department `` He's one of these fellows who's intelligent and he works efficiently,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, who retired two years ago after serving as a long-time professor of turf science at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>. `` He works lots of hours and he's put it all together,'' said <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, a 25-year associate of Funk. When the golf world's luminaries descend on the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> course in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for the Masters Tournament on Thursday, they will tread a course seeded partly with <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> strain, named after golf legend <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. The strain carpets many courses throughout the Northeast, <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> bluegrass, a hybrid of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> bluegrass, long has been used by groundskeepers at <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Flushing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said stadium manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` It's a sturdy grass and ideal for the temperature of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> gravitated to turf research after an early life dominated by agriculture. He was raised on a 600-acre dairy farm in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and earned undergraduate and master's degrees in agronomy from <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. After earning his doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> in 1961, <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> narrowly missed getting an appointment to research sugarcane growth in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But the miss freed him to become <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>' first full-time scientist working with turf grasses. He said his first creation to achieve widescale popularity was the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> perennial rye grass in 1967, which was considered a marked improvement over other rye grasses. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> said that grass still is used in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer stadiums. This spring, <ORGANIZATION> Funk </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> grass _ which is resistant to a number of insects _ should start cropping up on lawns, parks and cemeteries in the Northeast. Over the past 20 years, <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> has become highly regarded for his ability to adapt grasses to the needs of different climates and situations, said <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, of Lofts Seeds. But <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>'s colleagues say he never is satisfied, and they repeatedly are disarmed by his humility despite his grand reputation and stellar credentials. `` He's the first one we've looked to,'' said <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>. `` The great leader is <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>, who has developed probably more proprietary turf types than any one in the world.''

 Interest rates have edged higher in recent weeks, but most economists see no cause for alarm because there is little evidence that the driving force of the rise is higher inflation. Inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly strong economic growth, economists say. `` There is a lot of skepticism about inflation. I think it's healthy but probably unwarranted,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, vice president and economics director for <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based pension fund manager, said Tuesday Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of about 4 percent to 4.5 percent, roughly the same as in the past three years. The concern about inflation is a sharp contrast to opinions that prevailed after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Then, interest rates fell because investors felt the crash might trigger a recession and curb inflation. Rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell from about 11.6 percent just before the stock market crash last October to a little over 9.8 percent by February, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>. Instead of crashing, though, the economy has created more than 1 million jobs since October. The jobless rate fell to 5.6 percent in March, the lowest in nine years. Some investors changed their minds and decided the economy was in danger of overheating and high inflation. Mortgage rates consequently have crept back to just over 10 percent nationwide as of April 1, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> says. Inflation fears drive up interest rates because investors demand higher yields to make up for the erosion of the value of fixed-income investments that inflation causes. Americans are paying unusually high interest rates now because credit-market investors were burned by double-digit inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s and keep thinking those days might come again. Despite the fears of last October, many economists now have concluded the stock market crash was good for the economy because it cooled off an economy that was overheating. Steep recessions generally are preceded by inflationary overheating, which leads to high interest rates that in turn choke off economic growth. In the current economy, inflation has n't had a chance to accelerate because the credit markets have reacted so quickly to it, driving up interest rates and cooling the economy before it overheats, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, a managing director and financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In a sense, <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said, the economy has become self-correcting through the bond market's sensitivity to inflation. That may explain why the economy remains in the longest peacetime expansion of the 20th century. `` The bond market is running the economic show both globally and domestically,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. `` Bond managers, in effect, are in the driver's seat.'' Some economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, has engineered the recent uptick in interest rates According to that theory, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to prove its inflation-fighting credentials to the bond market. It is heading off a steep rise in interest rates over the long term by pushing them up slightly in the short term. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reaction is appropriate,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gols </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` To prepare for inflationary surges is much better than to do it afterward.'' But other economists say <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> action, if any, has been modest. One reason might be that any attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to cool off the economy with higher interest rates would punish the housing market, which is relatively weak. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is doing anything, `` They're just raising the flag and saying, ` Hey, we're here. We're not oblivious to what's going on in the world,''' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON>, chief economist in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> head office of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. The yield of the widely watched 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond has ticked up to about 8.9 percent this week from a recent low of less than 8.3 percent in early February. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said the bond probably would go no higher than 9.3 percent and no lower than 8.3 percent in the rest of 1988. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said it might edge up to 9.5 or even 9.7 percent by the end of the year. Gols, who is in a small minority of economists predicting a recession by the end of 1988, predicted the long bond's yield would rise slightly and then trend steadily downward.

 Four days after he won his fight for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> was looking to expand the retailer's top performers while cutting costs throughout the company. The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s division, which now has 17 stores, potentially could be a national chain and said he was considering opening branches in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as well But, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference, expansion would come second to cost-cutting and productivity. `` Our emphasis in the future is to raise the sales per square foot,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> unit, said they would review each of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s divisions to see where improvements could be made, and did not rule out layoffs. `` There will be some streamlining,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You can not survive and compete by having jobs and jobs and jobs.'' `` That does n't mean we will be laying off en masse,'' he said. `` We do want to expand.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, the nation's fifth largest retailer, agreed Friday to be taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based developer, in a $ 6.58 billion buyout. The agreement ended a 2-month-long battle that included a bidding war between <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said his company planned to retain <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets division in The 127-store chain was among the divisions <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to sell when it began its tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> would be sold into a wholly owned <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, with the proceeds of the sale used to help pay for the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> acquisition. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> reiterated that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> planned to retain six <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> department store divisions: <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>. But some stores in those divisions may be shut, <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said. `` Maybe they're better off as real estate locations,'' he said. He declined to say which stores might be targeted for closing. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was expected to deal with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> as he did Allied after it was acquired in 1986, by paring its unprofitable stores. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> already has agreed to sell four of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s department store divisions, and expects to sell its Gold Circle discount stores and its specialty store operations as well <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION>'s management have expressed interest in the 76-store chain. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> refused to discuss a meeting he held with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> last Thursday during which their takeover fight was resolved, but described <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> as `` relieved,'' and himself as `` delighted.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said the takeover will cost his company a total of $ 8.8 billion, including the price of Federated shares, refinancing of debt and expenses. He said he expected earnings of $ 375 million to $ 400 million from the combined operations of Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, based on the companies' 1987 sales. He said he did not expect to use junk-bond financing in the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> acquisition except in the Ralphs transaction.

The ruling came in a suit filed by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the departing executives of breaching their fiduciary duties in leaving the firm and conspiring to take away Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s business. Six top executives walked off the job at Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> on March 18, saying they felt unduly constrained under <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s management. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> was part of <ORGANIZATION> JWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which the British firm <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> acquired for $ 566 million in July 1987 in the biggest ad industry takeover to date.

 Food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has fired a longtime advertising agency, and one source familiar with the decision said it reflected <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s displeasure over the agency's no-smoking ads for another client <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> cited recent philosophical differences Tuesday for its decision to dismiss the ad agency <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and declined to elaborate. But a source familiar with the decision said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> was displeased at the ads <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> recently developed to tout <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' new no-smoking program Industry sources estimate the agency was handling as much as $ 100 million in ad billings for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> candy, cookies and chewing gum, making it a major account by ad industry standards. In announcing the dismissal in a statement from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the company said, `` It is important as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shapes and executes its marketing and sales objectives it deals with advertising agencies that have a wholly-consistent philosophical approach to its plans and programs.'' `` During this important period, philosophical differences have developed between <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and one of its agencies, <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` elected to conclude its relationship'' with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, the successor to agencies that have created ads for Life Savers candy for 18 years and various <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> cookies for 12 years. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> executives refused to elaborate on the statement, or to comment on the suggestion that it was unhappy with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s no-smoking ads for Northwest <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> said it was `` very saddened and disappointed'' at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s action, but its executives also declined to comment on what may have led to the decision But one source familiar with the events, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company was unhappy with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s ads for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which announced plans two weeks ago to ban smoking on most of its North American flights starting April 23. The airline has promoted the plan heavily in print and broadcast ads. The plan goes farther than required by government regulations, which ban smoking on flights of less than two hours starting later this month. In one television commercial announcing the plans, a lone smoker is shown puffing on a cigarette on an airplane. As the camera pans back up the aisle, a narrator announces <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to offer `` a smoke-free environment'' on all of its North American flights. The other passengers stand up and applaud. `` Upset is too mild a term,'' the source said when asked to describe RJR's reaction to <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s work for Northwest. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> employee, who asked not to be identified, in today's editions as saying the company did take away <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s assignments because of the Northwest ads, but mainly because the company had not been told of them in advance.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has upheld a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in its fight against a $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover attempt by British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said its board of directors decided it could not take a position on the outstanding hostile bid by the Beazer group because of the court ruling, other outstanding litigation and <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> ongoing attempts to seek alternative courses of action. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Judges <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pregerson </PERSON> late Tuesday denied the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group's appeal of a lower court order issued Monday that blocked its $ 60 a share hostile tender offer. The one-sentence ruling was announced from the appeal court's headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> issued a preliminary injunction suspending the tender offer indefinitely because of on antitrust questions. He issued the order after <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> argued that competition could be weakened in the local market for sand, gravel and hard stone for construction if <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> properties of <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> were combined. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group had argued that a delay in closing the tender offer could jeopardize financing for the takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> shares declined $ 1 to $ 56.25 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> met Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>, neither `` was prepared to discuss much of mutual interest at that meeting,'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stated in a news release. <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> requested the meeting, according to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> was not prepared to discuss the hostile tender offer or <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to negotiate a friendly merger with the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> construction materials and chemicals company, she said. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, on the other hand, declined to discuss anything but the takeover or a friendly deal. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> testifying before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> in a hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' lawsuit contending the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group violated securities laws in launching its tender offer March 3. The offer expires at midnight EDT Thursday. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> issued no ruling Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has disputed the accuracy of disclosures made in documents issued in conjunction with the tender offer. In his testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> identified documents suggesting <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemicals businesses could be sold after the takeover for as much as $ 700 million. The takeover plan calls for getting at least $ 400 million for those operations, although <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said no serious bidders had yet been found.

The new firm also will plan, design, supervise and undertake contruction projects. <PERSON> Fujita </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DMJM </ORGANIZATION> have engaged in technological cooperation since 1965, according to <LOCATION> Shigeoka </LOCATION>. `` We will jointly launch business activities to cope with a new age,'' <PERSON> Shigeoka </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Fujita </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Shigeoka </PERSON> said the new company, with a capital of about $ 80,600, was set up on Feb. 22 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The announcement of the venture was delayed as company officials watched developments in U.S.-Japan talks on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s construction market. The construction issue has caused friction in trade relations between the two nations, with many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies contending they are virtually shut out of the Japanese construction market while Japanese companies enjoy liberal access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers. Late last month, Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials agreed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would encourage foreign participation in major public works projects financed by the Japanese government, and in other projects with central or local government funding.

<DATELINE>HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A research team for <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has developed a new series of microchips capable of executing 7.5 million instructions per second, the company has announced. The microchips, known as the 80960 family, are designed for such uses as helping control robots, airplanes, automobiles and telecommunications, according to <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microcomputer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The microchips perform at two to three times the speed of previous microchip generations used for similar machine-controlling operations, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. In industrial markets, the chips are expected to supplement or replace other <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> chips that have been available for as long as 10 years, he said Tuesday. The new chips' circuitry incorporates about 500,000 transistors into a half-inch square of silicon. The circuitry involves parallel architecture that allows the chip or a combination of chips to attack various parts of a problem simultaneously, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s standard microprocessor and its predecessors, the new chip is programmed only once for a specific function, he said. Two of the new chips were designed for commercial use and the other two are for military applications, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Court: Model Worker Ineligible For Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> does not have to pay worker compensation to a model employee who fainted, struck his head and suffered severe and permanent brain damage after being told he was being demoted. The court ruled Tuesday in a case involving <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who had worked for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> for 19 years and was described by his supervisor, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Enk </PERSON>, as a good, punctual employee who never complained and appeared to enjoy his work. `` We conclude that claimant's physical injury did not result from an unexpected, unusual, or extraordinary stress related to employment,'' Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> wrote in the three-member court's unanimous ruling. `` The physical injury is therefore noncompensable as an industrial injury.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulman </PERSON>, called Tuesday's decision `` disappointing but not too surprising'' in light of precedents and said he anticpated an appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who is described as being in a vegatative state, was injured Aug. 8, 1985 when <PERSON> Enk </PERSON> told him that he was being reassigned in a cost-cutting move to a job that required different skills and carried a one-third cut in pay. The change also meant working for a new manager reputed to be a strict disciplinarian and about whom <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> already had expressed concern. `` Enk turned to walk away, and claimaint took two or three steps after him,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> wrote. `` Enk then turned back to speak with claimant again and saw him falling straight over backwards. Claimant's head struck the tile-covered concrete floor causing permanent brain damage.'' Rumors about pending job cuts had been circulating at <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> for one or two months, and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was worried about financial problems if he were displaced, according to court records. He also feared a new job might lead to a recurrence of earlier, work-related hernia problems. Expert witnesses who testified on <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s behalf said the faint stemmed from emotional shock and his present condition was unlikely to improve. But the judges said previous state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings made it clear that physical injuries caused by job-related emotional stress need not be compensated `` unless the stress is unusual, unexpected or extraordinary.'' And they said that threatened economic hardship, `` including such naturally traumatic events as layoffs and plant closures, may indeed expose the affected workers to varying degrees of emotional distress, but are not sufficiently unexpected, unusual or extraordinary in modern society to warrant compensability as an industrial injury.'' A switchboard operator at <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s Phoenix-area headquarters said no one was available for comment immediately.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union officials gathering today to formulate contract demands for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also prepared for a potentially bitter debate over the contract status of workers at the company's <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> plant. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the union may seek contract provisions to guarantee that workers receive profit-sharing bonuses whenever <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executives receive bonuses, regardless of the company's performance. Union representatives began gathering Tuesday to prepare for the April 18th opening of contract talks with the nation's third-largest automaker In addition to contract demands, the 140-member <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also was faced with the potentially divisive issue of whether 800 to 1,000 former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> should be brought under the national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last year, decided earlier this year to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> by year's end, leaving only an engine plant and some metal-stamping operations operating. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said he wants to include the remaining workers, represented by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72, under the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract _ which covers 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers at 49 local unions. He said the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers now are <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> employees and he wants to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> from moving their work _ they build engines for Jeeps assembled at a plant in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ to factories in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But other <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers said admitting the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers would take jobs away from workers laid off from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plants. Workers from closed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plants have the right to move into jobs that open through attrition at other factories _ a privilege that would be extended to the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers if they came under the national pact. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers said the issue was sensitive because of the automaker's recent attempt to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> terminated that proposal in early March in the face of bitter <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> opposition including the threat of crippling plant-by-plant strikes. `` How can you accept them into the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council when our people are n't even secure yet _ Acustar or Chrysler?'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON>, bargaining chairman of Local 624 at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> New Process Gear plant in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, N.Y. The Syracuse plant, which makes manual front-wheel-drive transmissions, is part of <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said he believed much of the opposition came from fear that the soon-to-be-laid-off <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> assembly workers also would be included, which they would not. He also argued that the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> historically has brought business and plants purchased by automakers _ such as the <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> plant _ under those companies' national contracts, usually resulting in increased wages and benefits for the new additions. The council was to discuss proposed demands today and vote on a demand package Thursday. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the package, which in most ways will mirror contracts signed last fall at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also may seek to guarantee workers a share of profits whenever corporate executives receive bonuses. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> contracts include worker profit-sharing payments based on sales and the companies' financial performance. But <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said that because executives receive bonuses regardless of their companies' performance, so should workers. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> also wants to close potential loopholes that have appeared in the job protection provisions in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> contracts, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. Both pacts forbid plant closings that were not announced before last year's negotiations but allow workers to be laid off if sales of a product fall. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has said it will idle two plants indefinitely later this year because sales of their products are slow.

<HEAD>Free Prescription Drugs To Treat Heart Disease Available Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is broadening its program to give free drugs to the the poor to include all of its medication for heart disease. Last year, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> began providing its high blood pressure medicine to people who could not afford to buy it and had no insurance. Now, all seven of its drugs that treat cardiovascular problems will be available to poor people without charge, said Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` I personally believe that all drugs that treat life-threatening diseases should be involved,'' <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday. `` But cardiovascular drugs are about all we make.'' No one who suffers from cardiovascular disease should be denied medication because they ca n't afford it, he said. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is inviting all physicians in the nation to participate in the program, which cost the company $ 9 million last year. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greener </PERSON>, a senior vice president, said <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> does not know how much the expanded program will cost, but he said the company expects it will double the existing program. `` There's no money limit on it,'' he said. <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON> said the company will deliver $ 1 million worth of certificates to clinics and hospitals in 10 major cities today to dramatize the expansion of its `` Patient in Need'' program. Any physician, clinic or hospital in the nation may request Searle certificates for needy patients. The company sets broad guidelines for patients to qualify but leaves it up to the individual physician to make the decision. The company is mailing instructions to doctors that classify poor people as those with annual household incomes of $ 8,000 for one or two people, or $ 11,000 for three or more family members. To qualify, patients must not have insurance or other assistance that would pay for the drug. `` It's up to the doctor to determine, but the patient does n't have to bring in tax returns or anything like that,'' said <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON> `` We believe the doctor knows who his poor patients are.'' <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> launched the pilot program with two drugs that treat high blood pressure in February 1987. Twenty-thousand patients have received free medication. The new expanded program includes five additional products used to treat high blood pressure, angina, arrhythmias and congestive heart failure. `` The American pharmaceutical industry can satisfy the unmet prescription needs of the medically indigent patient population in this country,'' <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Judee </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that all pharmaceutical companies do something but <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> is more extensive at working with the health-care delivery system. She said the other companies will help out in individual need cases or in third-world countries. But she said she knows of no other pharmaceutical company doing the same kind of work as <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> is a research-based company which develops, manufactures and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Two-thirds of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s sales are in cardiovascular drugs, <PERSON> Greener </PERSON> said. The other third is primarily oral contraceptives, he said.

<TEXT>
 A bitter power struggle is occurring over the publishing empire built by the late <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, with his wife, two friends and a longtime media industry rival fighting for control of the company. The highly successful <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> empire, which has annual sales of about $ 1.6 billion, publishes <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest daily newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, and dozens of other mass-circulation publications. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirch </PERSON>, another wealthy media entrepreneur, pooled his Springer shares with those of brothers <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frieder </PERSON> <PERSON> Burda </PERSON>, also publishers, last month to amass a stake larger than that of <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s heirs. West German news media have dubbed the resulting power struggle `` ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' on the Elbe,'' in reference to the popular American soap opera and to the location of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> _ where <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> has publishing plants _ on the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I think this -LRB- dispute -RRB- will simmer down, and the sooner the better,'' <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, advisor to the <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> family, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> played down the feud, saying: `` The interests of the major shareholders are all the same _ for the company to remain successful. This matter is not insurmountable.'' But <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s widow, 45-year-old <PERSON> Friede </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, has said in West German interviews that the affair has angered her. `` I am infinitely disappointed with the Burdas,'' the March 28 issue of the newsmagazine <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> quoted her as saying. `` I never imagined they would pull this kind of thing.'' A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Armgard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgsdorff </PERSON>, insisted <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> is interested only in the <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> company's continued success. `` The purpose of the agreement -LRB- with the <LOCATION> Burda </LOCATION> brothers -RRB- is to establish a stable majority, and to provide the publishing house with a leading role in a changing media world,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> office. Powers within the company have squabbled since 73-year-old <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> died on Sept. 22, 1985, leaving his wife and two sons as direct heirs. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> built a family-owned empire that in addition to the 5 million daily-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> includes the respected conservative daily, <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>. The day he died, the company stated that a few weeks earlier <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> had `` converted the company into a joint stock company... to safeguard the future of his holdings Among the stockholders were the <PERSON> Burda </PERSON> brothers and <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION>. Under a complicated formula, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s heirs and executors received control of about 26 percent of the company's shares, the <PERSON> Burda </PERSON> brothers 25.9 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> 10 percent. The rest went to the stock exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> says that in addition to his 10 percent share, he has obtained support from owners of another 16 percent of <LOCATION> Springer </LOCATION> stock. Mrs. <PERSON> Burgsdorff </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> heirs had agreed verbally in 1986 that <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> should have a stake of up to 26 percent, but the family later changed its mind. She said <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> then began discussions with the Burdas. The Axel Springer Verlag company is overseen by a supervisory board, whose members include the Burdas and Mrs. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> but not <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> is involved in film distribution and production and other media areas. The <PERSON> Burda </PERSON> family owns the West German `` Bunte'' magazine and other publications. Despite gaining more support through the Burdas and other shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> has not yet been able to overcome Mrs. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s opposition to his obtaining a seat on the supervisory board. Mrs. <PERSON> Burgsdorff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> had included <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> in the shareholding formula `` because he knew <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirch </PERSON> would be a strong media personality in the future.'' Neither Mrs. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> nor the <LOCATION> Burda </LOCATION> brothers could be reached for comment on Tuesday. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> family advisor, said: `` For the family, the legacy of <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> is important.'' But he added, `` This -LRB- dispute -RRB- almost had to come. Before it was owned by a family, now we are a shareholders' company.''

<HEAD>GE REaches Agreement To Acquire Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today they have reached a definitive merger agreement that will allow <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to move ahead with its proposed $ 507.6 million aquisition of <LOCATION> Roper </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> also extended its tender offer deadline by seven hours, until midnight Monday. GE, based in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, has offered $ 54 a share for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s outstanding stock. GE was tendered nearly 7.6 million shares as of Tuesday, while it needs only 4.7 million to take control of <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON> said today. The definitive agreement with <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> was the final hurdle prior to stockholder approval in a complicated acquisition that was made simpler last week when <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dropped out of the bidding. The battle for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, an appliance and lawn equipment manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, began in November. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> bid $ 50 a share, or $ 470 million, in its merger attempt. It decided to let <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> complete a deal unopposed after the two appliance giants agreed to share Roper products. The agreement between GE and <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> allows <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and its manufacturing capacity. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, in return, will get rights to the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> name for major appliances. GE will supply <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> with Roper-brand electric and gas ranges for at least two years. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> also will continue to sell its products to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The parties also agreed to other commercial relationships whereby GE would sell to <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> certain industrial components and materials.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Saudi Arabian Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> has replaced an American to become the first <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, his country's major oil-producing company. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelberer </PERSON>, who headed Aramco for 10 years. Aramco President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimi </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Kelberer </PERSON> as chief executive. The appointment of <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, announced late Tuesday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, reflects the shrinking role in Aramco of the four big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies that were formerly partners in the venture: <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Saudi government has gradually taken over control of <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> from the four companies starting in the 1970s, so that it is now 100 percent Saudi-owned. The four oil majors now mainly provide technical assistance to the Saudis. <PERSON> Kelberer </PERSON> will remain on the board of directors as vice chairman, although he has effectively retired. <PERSON> Kelberer </PERSON> has undergone a number of major surgical operations in recent years and is understood to have sought retirement after turning 60 two years ago. He has worked in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for more than 37 years, as <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive for the past decade. The change in <PERSON> Kelberer </PERSON>'s position leaves only two Americans in operating positions equal to vice president or higher at Aramco headquarters in <LOCATION> Dhahran </LOCATION>. Of <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION>'s 42,000 or so employees in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, only about 2,500 are Americans. The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government appointed <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> oil minister in November 1986, replacing <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> is studying a possible reorganization of the kingdom's oil industry, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources. The new structure, which is expected to include the creation of a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> national oil company, could be built on either Aramco or <ORGANIZATION> Petromin </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Petromin </ORGANIZATION> is the marketing company for Saudi petroleum products. In addition to his posts as oil minister and <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> also heads <ORGANIZATION> Petromin </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Jubail </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION>, the body overseeing the country's petrochemical industry.

<HEAD>EEC Finds No Signs of Economic Recession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite a slight drop in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s economic sentiment indicator in February, the 12-nation trading bloc is not heading for a recession, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, citing the latest business and consumer survey, said there were `` no signs of an approaching recession.'' It said the stock market crash and the turbulence on foreign-exchange markets last fall affected `` economic performance less than originally feared.'' The commission said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s economic indicator, which is based partly on the results of the survey, dropped to 102.7 in February from 102.9 in January, but was above the 102.6 level recorded in November 1987 after the October crash. The indicator comprises an industrial confidence indicator, a construction confidence indicator, a consumer confidence indicator and stock price indexes. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> economists reported that production expectations continued to point toward further growth over the next few months, while the outlook for exports looked brighter than anticipated. Lower-than-expected production results in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since last December have led industrialists there to revise their production expectations significantly downward, the commission said. The consumer confidence indicator lost a point in February over the preceding month, and consumers remained cautious about purchasing durables, the commission said. Retailers also continued to feel slightly pessimistic about future prospects, but their assessment of the overall business situation remained positive, according to the report.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Offers Senior Citizens Age-Matching Discounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced a two-month discount that will give senior citizens a percentage off their fare that matches their age. For example, a 65-year-old will receive a 65 percent discount and a 100-year-old will fly free, the airline said Tuesday. `` The stock phrase, ` I'm not getting older, just better,' deserves an updating,'' said A.B. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON>, executive vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. `` The older you are the greater your discount gets.'' The discount, which covers people aged 65 and older, is good from April 12 through June 8 and applies to all full economy fares on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic flights. The fares may be used every day except Fridays and Sundays and May 31, and reservations must be made and tickets purchased at least seven days in advance. Travel must include at least two nights' stay before returning and must be concluded by June 8. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> said the idea is to stimulate discretionary travel until the peak summer season begins in June. With that goal in mind, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ both subsidiaries of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ announced Tuesday that they are reducing fares for the next two months on tickets carrying restrictions used mainly by vacationers. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> made similar fare cuts. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s `` spring sales'' are for travel between April 18 and June 15, with no one-way fare greater than $ 99 for travel anywhere in the mainland <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The discount fares carry numerous restrictions and are not refundable. Tickets must be purchased in the next nine days. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will match the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> fares in most Northwest markets. Northwest was alone in offering the senior citizen discounts. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> said another goal of the discount program is to introduce World-Horizons, a frequent-flier program for seniors modeled after similar plans at other airlines. Seniors who enroll in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> plan, which begins June 1, can obtain discounted fares on many Northwest flights.

 The stock market edged higher in early trading today, extending a rally in the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.92 points on Monday, was up another 6.14 points at 2,003.65 after 90 minutes of trading.

They say some investors have also been unable to shake worries inspired by last October's price crash.

 For generations the unwritten code of conduct among bankers rendered hostile takeovers virtually taboo; that is, until the oldest bank in the country saw fit to break with tradition. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ founded by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> eight years after the the Declaration of Independence was signed and so ingrained in tradition it was sometimes dubbed the sleeping giant _ startled its colleagues by making a brash move for control of rival <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last fall. The joke around <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere had been that before <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> was killed in a duel, he told his employees not to do anything until he returned, and that was the way business has been conducted ever since. `` That's the impression a lot of people on the outside looking in have had of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. `` Of course, that's not true.'' Under the leadership of <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> since 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has moved to expand its market. Its twice-revised tender offer for Irving of $ 1.08 billion began last month with regulatory approval but without <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s blessings. Although it was n't the first hostile bank bid, it is the largest deal of its kind to have progressed this far in a close-knit industry that tries to avoid controversy. Banking analysts say hostile bids could become more commonplace, particularly among aggressive regional institutions, although they do n't foresee the same type of takeover frenzy prevalent in other industries since the Oct. 19 stock market crash made share prices attractive. `` The trend is evolutionary, not revolutionary,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Keefe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` However, we do think that the ground has been broken with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and that under the appropriate financial circumstances we could see other hostile offers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> bid _ in which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> declined to make any distinction between a friendly or hostile offer _ may encourage other institutions to take chances on takeovers even under stormy conditions. Banks have been merging, under friendly terms, at a fierce clip in recent years to keep pace with economic conditions, interstate banking law and new types of non-bank competitors like <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The industry also has been struggling with deteriorating profits due to shaky loans to Third World countries and to depressed domestic oil and farm regions. Since 1982, banks have led the nation in mergers and acquisitions, with an average 260 friendly deals a year during that period. Many more are expected as more states open their doors to outsiders. Despite the motivations, the nation's 14,000 commercial banks face significant hurdles in the merger process that other industries do n't have to clear. For one thing, banks have to go through a laundry list of local and government regulations, not to mention waiting periods and certain capital requirements, before even trying to win over shareholders. Among the agencies to pass judgment are the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, state banking boards, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and in some cases local community groups. And depending on the bank's charter, the comptroller of the currency also could step in. `` It's like a 12-course meal. It's very easy to overcook and undercook at any given time, and getting them off the table at the right times is not easy,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney specializing in bank mergers. `` Banking is really, in a way, quasi-public. It's different from other businesses. It -LRB- banks' coexistence -RRB- is definitely more than a gentlemen's agreement.'' Unlike other businesses, which, for the most part, can continue selling or manufacturing uninterrupted, banks have to worry about maintaining their trademark personal service. `` The banking business ... is really a people business,'' explained <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` As a rule a bank has gotten to the position it's in, based on its people and management.'' The depature of certain managers after a hostile takeover, for instance, could jeopardize a loan agreement that might have been in the works or force wary customers to move their deposits elsewhere, he said. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> also noted that hostile suitors, in particular, who are not privy to all of a target bank's books face additional obstacles. `` A bank's assets are much more difficult to judge than an industrial company,'' he said. `` ... The principal asset of a banking company is that loan portfolio composed of thousands of individual loans. When you get down to it we know little about them.'' In the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Irving </ORGANIZATION> merger, many analysts agree that a combination of the two would n't be such a bad idea since both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks operate in a similar marketplace and offer similar services like securities processing. `` More to the point <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has been an underperforming institution,'' said <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>. But most analysts are split as to whether <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> will succeed in creating one of the nation's 15th largest bank holding companies with assets of more than $ 40 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s current offer _ of $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s roughly 18.1 million common shares outstanding _ has been denounced as inadequate by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, which was founded in 1851 and also criticized as being a `` sleeper,'' has stressed its desire to remain independent, although it said it was talking with other parties and may seek a `` white knight,'' or friendly merger partner as an alternative to Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It has taken a number of steps to spurn <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s advances, including instituting an anti-takeover `` poison pill,'' intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive, and filing suit to block a proxy solicitation by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> Shareholders are scheduled to vote on <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed slate of 16 nominees to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board in about two weeks. Meanwhile, industry watchers say that if <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> succeeds it will be especially noteworthy, given the track record of similar proposals. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> made an unsolicited $ 3.2 billion bid for ailing <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but the proposal was spurned and the offer withdrawn. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Banc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> became <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s white knight after <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Ilsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 560 million cash and stock offer. In fact, since 1981, there have only been three significant successful hostile deals, although all have been under $ 100 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Acquisitions magazine. `` All bankers know each other. They all go to the same social events. It's not easy to be an outcast,'' said <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>.

 Stock prices turned slightly lower today, as an early rally effort faded in lackluster trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.91 points on Tuesday, was unchanged at 1,997.51 at noon on Wall Street. But losers ran slightly ahead of gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 612 up, 640 down and 531 unchanged. And several broader market indicators were down slightly. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 64.48 million shares at noontime, compared with 63.78 million shares at the same point in Tuesday's session. The stock market opened higher today, but gave up those early gains as the session wore on. `` We had a little buying enthusiasm as a remnant from yesterday's strong close, but then ran into a lot of resistance,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Now, we've bogged down here in narrow trading range.'' Analysts say investors' uncertainty about the direction of the economy and interest rates have put a damper on stock prices. They say some investors have also been unable to shake worries inspired by last October's price crash. In the credit markets today, the federal funds rate, a key short-term interest rate, edged over 7 percent. Rising rates make bonds a more appealing investment than stocks to some investors. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> was among the most actively-traded stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, falling 1 | to 55 The stock shot up more than $ 11 a share in the previous two sessions after a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Cable Shopping Service Suffers $20 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> home shopping service reported a first-year loss of $ 20 million and announced the departure of its chairman and chief executive. The company, which sells clothes, cosmetics and accessories over cable television, had sales of $ 5.5 million in its first four months of operation, according to the announcement Tuesday. The Fashion Channel, which formed about a year ago and went on the air in October, announced that co-founder <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON> would no longer serve as chairman and chief executive officer. Gee was the last of three founding top executives to leave the management. In January, the company announced the departures of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klauer </PERSON>, a former May Co.. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> president, and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Gee will remain as a director. Fashion Channel's newly named president, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said he has been talking to several parties interested in buying part of the company, including <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> and STN of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> QVC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` The company is still operating,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` It's busniess as usual and we're holding down the fort But it's not fun.'' The company attributed much of the loss to start-up costs. The company's stock took a drastic plunge in the October market crash, just over two weeks after it was first offered to the public. Since then, Fashion Channel has been forced to move merchandise by cutting prices drastically, said analyst <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> also blamed the loss in part on overbuying of goods that proved unattractive to customers.

 The stock market shook off some midday blues and pushed broadly and sharply higher this afternoon in tandem with a rise in the dollar. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.91 points on Tuesday, was up another 33.33 points at 2,030.84 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of 5 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,050 up, 416 down and 430 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 119.36 million shares with two hours left in the session, compared with 95.25 million shares at the same point in Tuesday's session. The stock market opened with some modest gains but had given them back by noontime before moving broadly higher in the early afternoon. Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the major industrial nations may be moving toward an agreement aimed at placing a lower limit on the currency against the Japanese yen. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, who follows the stock market for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>, said stock prices rose sharply in response because an agreement would reduce chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten its credit policy in a bid to head off inflation. A tightening by the central bank would encourage higher interest rates, making bonds more attractive as an investment in comparison with stocks.

 The Feds are finally getting <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s castle A federal court and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have begun foreclosure proceedings on the three-story, long-uncompleted castle owned by the hillbilly entrepreneur who made and lost a fortune by selling motivational-training and cosmetics franchises in the 1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has been trying for 10 years to collect a $ 15 million back-taxes claim against <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 53, who was in and out of trouble with the law for years because of what investigators said were illegal pyramid schemes that defrauded thousands of investors. He is currently serving a seven-year prison term in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on fraud convictions. Now, one of his prized possessions, the 16-room castle and 79 surrounding acres on <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is being sold at auction to satisfy an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> judgment against him in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> figures it will be lucky to get even a fraction of the final amount set by the court: $ 9.275 million. The estate was appraised by the county at $ 1.13 million in 1987, and recent appraisals by private companies list its value at between $ 1.6 million and $ 2 million. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will hold a hearing April 26 to decide if two bids for the property _ or any new ones made in the interim _ will be accepted. Once the property is sold, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has the right to be paid first from the proceeds. County Tax Collector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said about $ 16,900 in unpaid property taxes is owed on the property for 1987. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and his family have n't paid property taxes since 1979, but private investors have bought tax certificates equal to the back taxes each year. Under such an arrangement, the investors pay the taxes and earn 18 percent interest until the property is sold and the tax funds are paid back to them. Those tax payments will come from the sale, too. Court documents indicate there are dozens of other Turner creditors, but it is unlikely that they will be paid until all of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> judgment is satisfied, officials said. Bids on the Castle property will be advertised over the next few weeks to notify any potential bidders of the pending sale. Besides the castle, there is a boathouse with a three-bedroom apartment and a stable. The castle and boathouse have been vacant for several years, and the castle has been used only for tours and charitable events. Turner's financial empire crumbled in 1973 after he reportedly made about $ 300 million through aggressive marketing of his Orlando-based Dare To Be Great motivational classes and <PERSON> Koscot </PERSON> cosmetics distributorships. The self-styled country boy, son of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> sharecropper, rose to fame through inspirational speeches that promised great wealth if people bought distributorships in his operations. The companies collapsed under lawsuits filed by investors and investigations by state and federal agencies. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and a longtime partner, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, 57, were sentenced to prison in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on charges of operating a pyramid scheme there and defrauding investors through a later self-motivational company called <ORGANIZATION> Challenge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 The number of help-wanted advertisements in major newspapers rose slightly in February, indicating employers' hiring plans are little changed, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday The business research group's Help-Wanted Index rose to 156 in February from 153 in January, when the barometer dipped slightly.

 Wheat futures advanced while the other grains and soybeans were mostly lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat continued the gains posted during a sharp runup on Tuesday, and overnight news gave the market fresh incentive. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close of trading on Tuesday that it was offering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 2 million tons of subsidized wheat. This along with expectations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will bid on a half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of optimism in the wheat pit, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans struggled a little higher during the day, but collapsed under late selling pressure On the close, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.09 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.07 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 1.65 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $ 6.67 a bushel

 Stock prices pushed broadly and sharply higher this afternoon in tandem with a rise in the dollar. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 16.91 points on Tuesday, was up another 35.15 points at 2,032.66 as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,073 up, 451 down and 406 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 146.72 million shares with one hour left in the session, compared with 108.59 million shares at the same point in Tuesday's session. The stock market opened with some modest gains but had given them back by noontime before moving broadly higher in the early afternoon. Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the major industrial nations may be moving toward an agreement on supporting the currency against the Japanese yen. A meeting is planned for next week. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, who follows the stock market for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>, said the speculation on support for the dollar boosted stock prices because an agreement would reduce chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten its credit policy in a bid to head off inflation. A policy tightening by the central bank would encourage higher interest rates, making bonds more attractive as an investment in comparison with stocks.

<HEAD>Union Officials Meet Over Single-Union, No-Strike Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday to consider what the organization's policy should be regarding controversial single-union and no-strike deals, issues which threaten to split up the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>. Two member unions which have reached such deals on their own have threatened to pull out of the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s umbrella labor union organization, over the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>'s special review body, made up of about 20 members of its general council, held a one-day meeting to consider various proposals. The review body includes the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>'s general secretary, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. `` The issue is whether or not there should be some form of direction to unions about single-union and no-strike deals, and if there were such things, how they should be sanctioned,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. `` I am not aware of any particular details,'' he said. The review body was formed at the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention last September to review several areas. It is considering, among other things, whether unions should be required to ballot their members before agreeing to such deals, the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported. The body, which has been holding a series of meetings, is expected to announce its recommendations in a report issued before the next convention in September, at which <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION> delegates would vote on them. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s unions have been bitterly divided over whether to accept these deals, which have become more common in recent years, particularly at plants owned by Japanese companies. The unions have disagreed on how best to fight the loss of their power under the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> _ which has introduced union-curbing legislation that, for example, requires unions to ballot their members before calling a strike. The deals are strongly opposed by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest union. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, general secretary of the electricians union, known as the EETPU, has threatened several times to ballot his 336,000 members on pulling out of the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> has the support of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who also has warned that he would try to bring his 857,000-strong union out of the <ORGANIZATION> TUC </ORGANIZATION> if he were prevented from signing more of the controversial deals. The AEU is the country's second-largest union.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Europeans Risk Trade Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the governments of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Wednesday they are risking a trade war by their `` enormous subsidies'' to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> passenger planes. The major trade bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would permit the charging of extra `` countervailing'' duties on imports of the Airbus. They would be designed to compensate for the subsidies, raising the price of the foreign planes and thus improving the chances of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft manufacturers making sales to airlines here. `` The longer these governments delay in coming to grips with their own subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, the more they heighten the risk of a major trade conflict,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement. With the statement, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office distributed a detailed refutation of a report on March 18 by <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, the consortium that makes the planes, on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies to aircraft manufacturers. He criticized the report as containing `` poor scholarship and false conclusions.'' It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had provided about $ 23 billion in direct and indirect subsidies over the past decade to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials have long complained that the European subsidies give <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> aircraft builders an unfair advantage over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does not directly support civil aircraft programs,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` It is the four <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments that have lavished gigantic sums on Airbus for nearly two decades despite the program's inability to show any profit.'' He said he expects to see members of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in mid-May and would like to discuss indirect subsidies before then. `` We will not hold such discussions on the basis of a ` study' that has no credibility,'' he said After the last negotiations at <ORGANIZATION> Constance </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on March 18, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said a first step had been taken in a prospective agreement on production subsidies but that there was still a long way to go on subsidies for research and development. The statement issued by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government buys goods for its own needs and not to benefit any manufacturer. When major contractors make profits, they can spend them as they will, it added. `` By contrast, the Airbus partners must spend the money supplied to them by their governments on commercial airplane development and nothing else,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Real Estate Purchases in U.S. Totaled $12.77 Billion, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese investors bought $ 12.77 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate in 1987, a 70 percent increase over the previous year, according to a new report. The purchases were concentrated in markets traditionally favored by the Japanese _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ but investors are broadening their sights to include other areas as well, according to a study released Wednesday. The study, conducted for the last three years by <ORGANIZATION> Kenneth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laventhal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide accounting firm, is based on information from clients, public records and other sources, and is described by the company as a slight underestimation. The buying binge is spurred by the rising value of the yen in relation to the dollar, the tight real estate market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and attractive rates of return on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial real estate ranging from 6 percent to 9 percent a year, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON>, managing partner of the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office. Japanese real estate purchases mushroomed in the three years of the study: $ 1.86 billion in 1985, $ 7.53 billion in 1986 and $ 12.77 billion in 1987. In 1987, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was the favorite shopping spot, attracting $ 3.3 billion from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the study found. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was second, with $ 2.98 billion, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was third, with $ 2.34 billion. Far behind, in order, were <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Office buildings commanded the most dollars from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ $ 5.19 billion in 1987. Investment in hotel and resort properties soared 160 percent in 1987, to $ 4.57 billion, partly because of several big purchases in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Investment in residential property was $ 1.3 billion. The study found increasing Japanese interest in so-called secondary real estate markets, including <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. For the first time in the three years of the study, 56 percent of the purchases were in secondary markets.

 The stock market rolled up one of its biggest gains of the year today, taking its cue from a stronger dollar and a decline in interest rates.

Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign exchange trading, which in turn prompted a decline in interest rates.

 The stock market surged Wednesday, putting in its second-best performance so far this year after taking a cue from a stronger dollar and lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 16.91 on Tuesday, jumped another 64.16 points to close at 2,061.67. It was the biggest rise in the key blue-chip indicator since it climbed 76.42 points on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year. Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 3 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 189.76 million shares, compared with 135.29 million on Tuesday. The Dow's advance was so strong it triggered a 50-point voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the limit was announced Feb. 4. Program trading, a technique used by brokerages to profit on price differences between stocks and the corresponding stock-index futures, has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market and frightening investors. The market climbed steadily throughout the afternoon after trading in a narrow range earlier in the day. Analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign exchange trading, which in turn prompted a decline in interest rates in the credit markets. The dollar moved higher, they said, on speculation that the major industrial nations may be moving toward a fresh agreement to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency.

 The dollar continued its ascent against most major currencies Wednesday on rumors of more dollar-buying by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and a possible multinational accord to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold and silver prices fell in reaction to the dollar's strength <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 448.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 452.65 late Tuesday. A news report out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, quoting anonymous sources, said finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven countries are likely to agree that the dollar should be held above 125 yen. Traders gave credence to the rumor of the dollar-yen target when they saw evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was buying <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities for a customer, which they guessed might be the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The dollar has also been helped somewhat by a high federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The higher rate makes dollar-denominated securities more attractive. <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said the dollar eased off from its highs of the day when traders observed that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was injecting reserves into the financial system, something that would tend to restrain interest rates. Dealers said the dollar was also boosted when a feared Japanese selloff of dollars at the beginning of the new quarter failed to materialize. But they said trading was likely to remain limited before next week's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ and the April 14 release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. The pound fell to $ 1.8790 from $ 1.8800 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.8716 from $ 1.8790 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 125.03 Japanese yen from 124.43 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it edged back to 124.98 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 126.03 yen from 125.28 yen late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6790 West German marks, up from 1.6706; 1.3893 Swiss francs, up from 1.3769; 1.2416 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2418; 5.6925 French francs, up from 5.6645; and 1,243.12 Italian lire, up from 1,237.75.

 <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 512 million in cash after resisting repeated overtures from the Houston-based cement company. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s board recommended shareholders relinquish their shares to <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>'s existing $ 40-a-share tender offer. The offer expires at midnight EDT Wednesday, but <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> said it would accept <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> shares for payment following the expiration of that deadline. Under terms of a definitive merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> also will acquire <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s convertible issues and debt. The companies have agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between them. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> fell 75 cents to close at $ 39.75 a share; <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents to $ 40.75 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> also said it would terminate a previous agreement to sell <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s oil and gas subsidiary, called <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engery </ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Castex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 125 million in cash. A <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman had no comment on whether <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> management would be asked to stay on board. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based cement and energy concern, had said it was negotiating with other unidentified parties about the acquisition of the entire company. The <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> board met Tuesday to weigh bids for the company _ including <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>'s _ as well as a recapitalization plan the board had engineered as a defensive measure. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer for <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s 12.8 million outstanding shares represents the fourth time the company has sweetened its bid. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> approached <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> on Feb. 23 with an initial $ 31-a-share tender offer, which valued the company at $ 391 million. That bid, as well as a sweetened $ 35-a-share offer that followed, were rejected as inadequate. `` The board of directors of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> continues to believe that remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the long-range term,'' the company had said in a statement following the two offers. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> responded to the two bids by unveiling a $ 400 million recapitalization plan that would have paid shareholders a hefty dividend and authorized the sale of certain assets. The company had even lined up loans to finance the payout and related costs. A day after the recapitalization plan was unveiled, <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> responded with an offer that would have paid shareholders $ 35 in cash plus debt securities valued at $ 5 for each share they held. The bid was amended to a straight $ 40-a-share in cash last week. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> posted a profit of $ 21.6 million on revenue of $ 357.8 million in 1987. The company makes cement, concrete products and aggregates, primarily in the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production mainly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and is active in oil and gas production.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Plunge on Dollar's Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures retreated sharply Wednesday, triggered by the surging value of the dollar. On other markets, wheat and cattle futures moved higher; other grains and beans were mostly a little weaker; and stock index futures posted substantial gains, following a rally on the stock market. There were strong movements on most of the financial markets. `` The story that seemed to light the fire under all these markets was a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news account that -LRB- major financial ministers -RRB- would reaffirm the lower the lower limit of the dollar at about 125 yen,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. There have been unconfirmed reports that the finance ministers from the five major industrial nations will meet next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. This supposedly would be in conjunction with scheduled meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese wire service, Nikkei, reported Wednesday that the Group of 5 nations will affirm the dollar-yen rate. `` This was just a report,'' said <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, `` and we do n't have any idea if there's any truth to it. But with the yen at 125 this morning ... the dollar went higher,'' he said. `` This pushed the precious metals to the brink,'' he said, `` with silver especially putting in a very poor performance.'' On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 4.40 to $ 5.70 lower with June at $ 451.30 a troy ounce; and silver was 22 cents to 22.5 cents lower with May at $ 6.465 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> recorded one of the busiest days since the October stock crash. Estimated volume of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index was an estimated 62,286, compared with a monthly average in March of about 48,000. A surge in the Dow Jones Industrial average triggered a curb at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on program trading, under which traders buy or sell stocks and take the opposite action in index futures. This came late in the session, however, and apparently did n't have a large impact on trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. The June S & amp; P 500 contract settled 7.90 points higher at 267.40. The underlying index was up 6.98 points at 265.49. Cattle futures advanced on follow-through buying from Tuesday's late recovery at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but the underlying factors do n't look good, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Feedlots are selling a little cheaper for the first time in two or three weeks,'' he said, adding that the boxed beef trade is declining `` Salesmen are saying they're having trouble moving beef at the retail counter and they're disappointed with the performance at Easter,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. Live cattle futures settled .12 cent to .48 cent higher with the contract for delivery in April at 74.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .40 cent higher with April at 79.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .28 cent higher with April at 45.70 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .02 cent higher with May at 53.22 cents a pound. Wheat futures advanced while the other grains and soybeans were mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat continued the gains posted during a sharp runup on Tuesday, and overnight news gave the market fresh incentive. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close of trading on Tuesday that it is offering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 2 million tons of subsidized wheat. This along with expectations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will bid on a half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of optimism in the wheat pit, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with the May contract at $ 3.09 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.07 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 1.65 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.67 \ a Energy futures were little changed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the April contract at $ 16.30 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent lower to .18 cent higher with May at 45.34 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .07 cent lower to .22 cent lower with May at 48.42 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
 Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers voted Wednesday to seek the job protections and economic benefits won by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union in contracts signed last fall with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We've had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a year. ... It should not take a long time for us to put this together,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> told reporters after addressing the 140-member <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> agreed to open talks early _ April 18 instead of mid-July _ after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary sparked bitter worker opposition. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed down from the sale in early March, shortly after the issue erupted, but decided the damage left in its wake would intensify if the two sides waited until July to meet at the bargaining table. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said he did n't believe the rift would hurt the chance of an early settlement mirroring the industry-pattern <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contracts. `` I do n't plan on sitting in early negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> from the time we open here in April until Sept. 14,'' when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract expires, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said, adding that bargainers will set a target settlement deadline after talks begin. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> also said negotiators would try to save four <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> plants that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it will close or sell. The Chrysler contract covers 59,000 active and 8,000 laid-off workers at 49 local unions. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> wants a two-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> instead of the usual three-year pact so that its contracts with all Big Three automakers will expire together in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the council will vote Thursday on other demands and on a potentially divisive issue _ whether nearly 1,000 former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers at an engine and stamping plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, should be included under the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract. Some local union leaders said they oppose the idea because if the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> engine plant closes, those workers would have the right to take jobs that otherwise could go to laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> already has said it will close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> by year's end, and those workers will be covered under a separate closing agreement. All the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers belong to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> but currently work under contracts negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION>, not <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the union traditionally has included operations purchased by an automaker under that company's national contract. Other union officials, who asked not to be identified, called the opposition selfish and argued that the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers already are part of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last year. Proposals approved Wednesday would, like the pattern <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contracts, forbid plant closings not announced before the start of negotiations. The union's proposals for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also would ban sale of plants or other operations, according to the printed resolutions approved by the council. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> agreements also forbid layoffs for any reason except slow sales of a product. The exception, seen as a loophole by many workers, has allowed <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to indefinitely close plants that make products whose sales were lagging. But <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said any loophole would most likely be addressed in 1990 talks rather than at the Chrysler table this year. Under the pattern, workers also will receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 and 1989 earnings and a share of sales-generated profits if their companies' earn above a set amount. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> also wants to increase its representation on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors _ already unique in the auto industry _ from one seat to four The current seat belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> president, and <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said it gives him an extra chance to try influencing some corporate decisions that affect his members. With three other <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members on the board, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> joked, `` It would n't be a 19-1 vote anymore. I'm convinced I could convince my -LRB- UAW -RRB- colleagues to vote with me.''

 The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Lottery said Wednesday it has decided to stick with its computer vendor, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, in a new five-year, $ 143 million contract. Companies from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were unsuccessful in their bid for the contract with the lottery, the nation's third largest. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Lottery had gross revenue of of $ 1.3 billion in 1986-87 and profits of $ 570 million. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s Automated Wagering Division, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, will supply a minimum of 3,200 new sales terminals and a primary and backup computer with new telecommunications features, said Revenue Secretary <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> Fields. The new equipment is to be installed by next January. After a three-month review, lottery officials decided <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s 11 years' experience as the lottery's computer supplier and its proposed system were among the reasons to keep the company, Fields said. `` CDC, by virtue of its state-of-the-art technology and expertise, is the supplier best suited to serve the lottery into the 1990s,'' Fields said in a statement. Other vendors who had submitted proposals were <ORGANIZATION> G-Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hunt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, Md. and Scientific Games of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The new contract will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and the $ 143 million is the estimated worth over five years. `` The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Lottery system will be the newest and most powerful lottery system available to the lottery industry today,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidester </PERSON>, vice president of wagering services for the Automated Wagering Division. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, with over 50 percent of the market for on-line lottery equipment, supplies lotteries in five states besides <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and recently was awarded the contract for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new lottery, the company said The other states with <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> equipment are <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will expand a program of giving heart disease drugs to the poor, a move observers say puts the company at the helm of the pharmaceutical industry's efforts to help the indigent Under a year-old pilot program, Skokie-based <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 9 million worth of high blood pressure medicine to 20,000 patients. The company said it would expand its `` Patient In Need'' program by making all seven of its heart medicines available. The plan will roughly double the cost and the number of patients involved, company officials said. To kick off its expanded program, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> planned on Wednesday to deliver $ 1 million worth of certificates for drugs to clinics and hospitals in 10 major cities. `` I personally believe that all drugs that treat life-threatening diseases should be involved,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. He noted that congressional sources put the number of Americans without any health insurance at 37 million. <PERSON> Judee </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said all drug manufacturers do something to help poor patients, `` but <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> is more extensive.'' Most of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s drugs are cardiovascular medications, and <PERSON> Gilgore </PERSON> called on other pharmaceutical houses to follow suit with their drugs. `` This area is extremely tricky,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nefi </PERSON>, a spokesman for E.R. <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` Drugs are a commodity rigorously controled by the federal government. It's not like making shoes and giving them to the poor.'' <PERSON> Nefi </PERSON> said he was not familiar with the details of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s program, but he noted that `` the distribution mechanism is going to be difficult, and I would like to see how they're going to do it. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s expanded effort will distribute the drugs in the same manner as the pilot program, said spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greener </PERSON>. Participating doctors are issued certificates from <LOCATION> Searle </LOCATION>. Patients receive both a prescription and a certificate, both of which must be presented to a pharmacist. Patients get the drugs for free, while pharmacists mail the certificates to <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for reimbursement. The company classifies poor people as those with annual household incomes of $ 8,000 for one or two people, or $ 11,000 for three or more family members. To qualify, patients must not have insurance or other assistance that would pay for the drug. Several other drug makers have some form of indigent care program. <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dohme </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, donates drugs to various charitable groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes them to physicians who pass them on to the needy at home and abroad. <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> also will give free drugs to individual doctors who request them for poor patients, said spkeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gellert </PERSON>. `` We feel we give a pretty broadly based coverage,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Roxane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, gives a drug to poor terminal cancer patients in severe pain, said company spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojta </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Greeting Card Company Reports Earnings Decline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American Greetings, the nation's second largest greeting card company, reported Wednesday that its earnings declined by 95.1 percent in its fourth quarter, which included Christmas sales. The quarter contributed to a 47.3 percent earnings decline in American Greetings' fiscal 1988, completed Feb. 29. <PERSON> Morry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said at a news conference that stiff competition, combined with unexpected returns of seasonal merchandise, contributed heavily to the earnings drop. The company's AmToy subsidiary also had a disappointing quarter and year, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. The company earned $ 748,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, although revenue amounted to $ 314.5 million. In the final quarter of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greetings </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 15.3 million, or 48 cents a share, on revenue of $ 291.2 million. For the full fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greetings </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 33.4 million, or $ 1.04 a share, on revenue of nearly $ 1.2 billion. In the prior year, earnings came to $ 63.6 million, or $ 1.97 a share, on revenue exceeding $ 1.2 billion. Earnings dropped for a third consecutive year. The per-share earnings of $ 1.04 was the lowest since fiscal 1981, when earnings were 97 cents per share. `` While results for fiscal 1988 are a major disappointment, the good news is that they reflect, in part, a number of corrective measures taken which should be positive for our future prospects,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. He said the company has begun or is considering consolidation of its manufacturing and distribution operations of the domestic greeting card business, personnel reductions, revisions in seasonal merchandise shipping and a scaling back of the toy business. He also said the company needs a spurt of creativity to increase sales, adding that there has been good initial reaction to its new Nosy Bears and Special Blessings products. The Cleveland-based company employs about 20,000. Some layoffs occurred last year, although the company-wide figure has not been made public, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greetings </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<HEAD>Maryland Senate Approves Bills To Block Chesapeake Bay Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spurred by the increased interest shown by petroleum companies in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a measure Wednesday that would forbid drilling for oil and gas in the bay and its tidal tributaries. The measure, drafted by a legislative workgroup, now goes to Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, who has endorsed the ban as a necessary element in the multi-state effort to protect the bay's environment The upper house also approved two other bills that would give the state a greater role in regulating oil and gas exploration and production elsewhere in the state. While there is currently no drilling in the bay, the environmental community became alarmed late last year by reports that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would fund additional seismic testing in the bay to locate possible oil or gas deposits. During an earlier hearing on the bill, Delegate <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Frosh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Montgomery </LOCATION>, chief sponsor of all three bills, likened oil drilling in the bay to `` playing Russian roulette.'' ` A single spill could set back all of our bay cleanup efforts many years,'' insisted Frosh. `` The <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is far too important to our heritage and our future to put at risk in this fashion.'' At the same hearing, oil industry representatives said they have a good environmental record in off-shore drilling and urged lawmakers not to thwart the search for new petroleum sources. `` This country and this state can not wait until the next international oil crisis arises,'' argued <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> administration also has given tentative backing to the other two measures approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. Both bills will be returned to the House for further consideration. Under HB296, the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would be given the power to deny any application for drilling rights in so-called critical areas surrounding the bay. HB296 would require the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> to adopt regulations to govern oil drilling leases in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The bill also would hold drilling companies liable for any environmental damage caused by their activities.

 A federal judge said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> can not proceed with his $ 1.7 billion hostile tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until at least April 15 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday suspended the $ 60-a-share offer indefinitely on antitrust grounds. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> said if <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> succeeds in overturning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ruling, his order immediately blocks the offer until he rules on <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' arguments that the unwanted suitors violated securities law. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said he will rule by April 15 on the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> construction materials and chemicals company's request for a preliminary injunction. It was not immediately clear how this latest barrier would affect the tender offer from <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the takeover company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Attorneys for the Beazer interests said a delay could scuttle its tender offer. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said Wednesday he expects <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer will be declared inadequate by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. `` My judgment is that with more time we will find that -LRB- the bid -RRB- is inadequate,'' <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> testified in federal court, one day after <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' board said it was reserving judgment on the offer. Under questioning by <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said he also expected someone to beat the $ 60-a-share offer. `` I'm not sure I could hazard a guess as to when'' a better offer might come, <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said. The chairman said he expected some stockholders would consider $ 60 a share as an adequate offer. He said he also expected some shareholders would want to accept the $ 60 a share. Arbitrageurs likely would tender their stock as well, he said. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, head of the construction and building materials concern <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Shearson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was to have expired at midnight Thursday. The two are partners in BNS along with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which launched the tender offer March 3. <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> on Wednesday that the board is considering selling an interest in all or part of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> prefers to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued construction materials and services group, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has said it also is considering a recapitalization plan and, if necessary, the sale of the entire company as a defensive measure. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> director, noted in testimony Tuesday that a recapitalization plan is still in the formative stages. A management-led buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemicals businesses also has been considered an alternative to the BNS offer. `` Some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout, which would keep -LRB- the company -RRB- here in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> testified during a hearing to consider <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' request for an injunction. So far, however, a leveraged buyout of the company's chemical operations `` has n't been actively pursued,'' partly because of the costs involved, he added. <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board met Tuesday with its financial advisers, who gave ambiguous opinions on <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s valuation of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, engaged to advise non-management directors, was unable to say the $ 60-a-share offer was adequate, but <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is advising all the directors, was unable to say the offer was inadequate, <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> closed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday at $ 55.37 -LCB- a share, down 87 -LCB- cents. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday denied an emergency motion to overturn the lower court. But the appeals court will take the appeal during the coming week, <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said.

 Fortified by a stronger dollar, lower interest rates and an afternoon of frenzied buying, the stock market soared Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average posted its second biggest gain of the year. But despite the strong gain, some analysts were skeptical about how long it could last. `` It was a very impressive rally, but it's still a manic depressive market, so I'm not trusting it yet for any sustained move,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Czech </PERSON>, head of the investment policy group at the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Blunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loewi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. The Dow Jones industrials, the market's best-known indicator, advanced 64.16 points to close at 2,061.67. It was the ninth biggest gain ever in the Dow Jones industrials and the largest gain since it climbed 76.42 on Jan. 4. The Dow's gain was so powerful that it triggered a 50-point voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the limit was announced Feb. 4. But even after the restriction was triggered, stock prices continued to rise until the market closed. Gainers swamped losers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally of NYSE-listed issues, with 1,187 up, 414 down and 384 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 3.47 to 149.76. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 189.76 million shares, up from 135.29 million shares on Tuesday. The stock market opened with some modest gains but gave most of them back by noontime before sweeping broadly ahead in the early afternoon. Analysts said the trigger for the market's rise was a news report from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that said officials of the seven major industrial countries are likely to agree on a plan of support for the dollar. A strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure, and perhaps ease the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its credit policy, said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, who follows stocks for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>. Expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would tighten its policy and raise interest rates had been depressing stock market psychology, he said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a market watcher for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar's strength soon rippled through the bond market, sending long-term rates lower. That in turn made yields on stocks look more attractive, he said. In each of the markets, he said traders who had sold borrowed contracts in expectations that the dollar, bonds and stocks would fall suddenly saw prices rising and felt compelled to buy in an effort to cut their potential losses. `` Too many people were selling the market short,'' he said. The voluntary restrictions on program trading were called into play after the Dow Jones average passed the 50-point gain mark at about 3:19 p.m. EDT, a spokeswoman for the exchange said. Program trading, a technique used by brokerages to profit on price differences between stocks and the corresponding stock-index futures, has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market and frightening investors. Among actively-traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 \ to 28 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 \ to 49, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 to 44 and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LRB- to 41 F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RCB- to 54 ~ The stock shot up more than $ 11 a share in the previous two sessions after a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said Wednesday he does not want a judge to set aside his setence for tax evasion that grants five years' probation on the condition he set up a $ 3 million program for the homeless. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> responded to a motion filed Monday by a federal prosecutor challenging the legality of that sentence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said the court could not force a defendant to make a contribution to `` a non-aggrieved person.'' At a hearing Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> required the 69-year-old <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to state under oath that he did not wish the sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the plan `` freely and voluntarily.'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s chief attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, must formally reply to <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>'s motion within 30 days. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> heard <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and a 10-member blue-ribbon committee discuss the program's first stage, a study of homelessness in three southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties. `` Since February, I have been studying and learning about the problems of the homeless both nationally and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said in a brief statement. Part of his sentence has included work at <ORGANIZATION> Camillus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a refuge for the homeless in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> served food, attended substance abuse meetings and gave out clothing. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said the study, which is being administered by <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, will examine groups such as alcoholics, the mentally ill and families with children and will review how government policies affect homelessness. Findings of the study are scheduled to be available by mid-May. But he stressed that the study is not the most important element of the program. `` All the studies in the world will not help one homeless person,'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> added. `` I will come to you with what will solve the problem.'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said he did n't plan to take an active role in the committee's work, but he suggested the initial study not use more than $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 of <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s donation. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said he was ready to deposit the necessary money in any institution directed by the court. The sentence also ordered <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to pay about $ 4 million in back taxes, penalties, interest and fines for pleading no-contest to 10 counts of tax fraud for inflating the value of land donated to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its legality might be questioned. `` If for some reason -LRB- the sentence -RRB- is ever challenged, this court will, in fact, incarcerate <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>,'' he said in February. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for the offenses.

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that more suitors have come forward since the filmmaking company announced Monday it was considering several unsolicited takeover bids. Separately, the company reported it had reduced its losses by 73 percent for the second quarter and 84 percent for the half, partly because of its successful film `` Moonstruck.'' Disclosure of the new bids came as the company announced a special committee of its board has been formed to weigh the offers. The committee does not include financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns 79 percent of the company's 50.1 million shares. `` The committee will promptly consider the inquiries received before Monday's announcement, as well as additional inquiries received in the last two days,'' said <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>. The company again declined to identify the suitors or to indicate whether it would be amenable to a takeover, saying only, `` We have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters.'' Analysts have suggested <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> may be offering to buy the rest of the stock and take the company private. Other likely investors listed by analysts were investors <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, whose separate bids for other companies are stalled and considered unlikely to succeed. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> had been majority owner of the old <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> studios </ORGANIZATION>, then sold them in 1986 to media entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> for $ 1.5 billion plus assumption of some debt. As part of that deal, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> immediately repurchased the <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> segment. Later, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> sold off all of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> unit except for its film library that he is using on his Atlanta-based superstation <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kerkorkian </PERSON> purchased the studio and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar-Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought some other assets. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> paid a total of $ 730 million to buy back the two segments and has had spotty success in his attempts to rebuild the companies. For its second quarter ended Feb. 29, the comapny posted a net loss of $ 4.6 million, compared with a deficit of $ 17.1 million a year earlier. Revenue for the period rose 48 percent to $ 157.9 million from $ 106.2 million. For the half, the company trimmed its losses to $ 2.6 million from $ 14.4 million, as revenue rose 43 percent to $ 339.9 million from $ 237.2 million.

 Buyer incentives and economic confidence boosted late-March and first-quarter sales reported Wednesday by the Big Three automakers. Some import carmakers also reported increases although many posted declines for the March 21-31 sales period and for the quarter, blaming the weaker dollar that effectively raised their prices for American buyers. Domestic car sales totaled 332,721 for the 10 days, up from 282,358 for the nine-day sales period of late March 1987. Domestic sales for the first quarter totaled 1,914,022, up from 1,666,748 a year earlier. Import car sales, reported monthly, totaled 255,867 for March, up from 237,677 in March 1987, and totaled 700,572 for the quarter, up from 639,403 in the 1987 first quarter. First-quarter sales of imported light trucks slid to 168,908 from 204,424 in the 1987 first quarter. Domestic light truck sales jumped to 1,044,984 for the quarter from 840,073 a year earlier. Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.4 million for the late March period, up from a strong 8.1 million rate for the period last year, and were 7.5 million for the month, up from 7.3 million for March 1987. `` Sales are robust for the month, continuing what was going on in January and February,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Certo </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. She added buyers appeared confident in a strong election-year economy and unworried about last October's stock slump <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> each reported more than 18 percent jumps in daily sales rates for the quarter while <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the top seller, reported a 9.5 percent rise. Dealers incentives helped, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` Cash-allowance buyer incentive programs are in effect a temporary price cut and the buyers are reacting to the bargain prices,'' <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 159,728 domestically produced autos for the 10 days, up from 136,082 in the nine-day late-March period last year, and 942,830 for the quarter, up from 849,470 in the 1987 first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s daily sales rate was up 9.5 percent. Ford domestic auto sales totaled 93,590 for the 10 days, up from 79,249 a year earlier, and 553,545 for the three months, up from 462,629 for the 1987 first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> set a record with sales of 150,522 domestically made light trucks for the month of March, up from 132,126 in March 1987 and the most for any March for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold 48,125 domestic cars for the 10 days, up from 41,652 in the year-ago period, and 283,491 for the quarter, up from 236,280 in the first quarter of 1987. Some import carmakers also reported increases. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> sales rose to 42,734 for March from 37,099 in March 1987, and 127,050 for the quarter, up from 101,117 in the first quarter of 1987. But Nissan sales slid to 39,536 for the month from 41,824 in March 1987, and to 92,163 for the quarter, down from 119,452 a year ago.

 The advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in turmoil since a number of top-level executives quit to form their own agency in mid-March, said Wednesday it has added two senior executives from other advertising agencies to its management team. The agency, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, named <PERSON> Agi </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a 19-year veteran of the agency N.W. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather, to senior management. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was named executive vice president and managing director for creative services at Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>.
