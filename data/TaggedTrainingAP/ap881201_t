<HEAD>Blood Bank Held Responsible for Transfusion-Related AIDS Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A jury found a blood bank negligent Thursday for improperly screening its blood in the case of a 5 -LCB- - year-old boy who contracted AIDS through a transfusion, a verdict believed to be the first of its kind, lawyers said `` We just feel this is a great moral victory. I think the blood industry, particularly in high-risk areas like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has got to shape up,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, was the plaintiff in the case. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who has a brain tumor and lymphoma, was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in September 1987. He has only a few months to live, said the Osborns' lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. `` At least <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> will be around in some way in the future. At least his name will not be forgotten,'' added Mrs. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>. The jury found <ORGANIZATION> Irwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies blood to about 40 hospitals, to be negligent in failing to screen the blood adequately, although some AIDS screening was done at the facility at the time. In addition, the jury ruled that the blood bank erred in not allowing family members to target their blood donations for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON> said the blood bank had rejected requests by the boy's family and friends to donate blood for the transfusion, saying they had no policy to accommodate such requests when in fact they did The blood bank's attorney, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, denied that the blood bank acted negligently and said the decision will be appealed. The jury awarded the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> family $ 550,000 in compensatory damages. The child, suffering from a congenital heart defect, received the transfusion Feb. 24, 1983, when he was three weeks old. The boy's parents were awarded $ 200,000 to pay for past and future medical bills but were denied any damages for pain and suffering. The jury voted unanimously to award the damages and split 9-3 on the question of liability, said <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. Defending <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s decisions in the case, <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said in 1983 the blood bank had a policy of allowing so-called directed donors only for medical reasons, such as blood donations from organ donors. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, founder and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> HemaCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a private blood bank in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, said the case was the first time a blood bank was found responsible for a transfusion-related AIDS case. A <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> jury in June cleared a blood bank of liability in the case of a woman who contracted AIDS through a transfusion. A similar case in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1986 ended in a settlement before the trial ended. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Human Ancestors Used Fire Up to 1.5 Million Years Ago, Study

<TEXT>
 Scientists said today they have found the earliest direct evidence for use of fire by ape-men or early humans, bone fragments that were burned as long as 1.5 million years ago. Fires were apparently a regular event in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> cave where the fragments were found, although it is unclear whether they were for cooking, warmth or scaring predators, scientists said. `` We're not absolutely certain those bones were there -LRB- in fire -RRB- because they were food remains,'' said researcher <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON>. `` They could have been thrown into the fire as kind of a refuse heap.'' <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and C.K. Brain of the <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, describe their analysis in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The fires may have been set by ancestors of humans called <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> erectus, or by ape-men called Australopithecus robustus, which are not direct human ancestors, they wrote. In an interview, <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON> said the bone fragments could be 1 million to 1.5 million years old, but most likely they are 1.2 million years old. Previous research suggests fire was being used in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> a bit more recently than 1.4 million years ago, a date many experts accept but with some hesitancy, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delson </PERSON>, professor of anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. That research is supported by indirect evidence, magnetic irregularities in the ground thought caused by ancient fire on the surface, he said in a telephone interview. The evidence from the new study is `` certainly the strongest to date in favor of early human-controlled fire,'' <PERSON> Delson </PERSON> said. Other research suggests fire was used slightly less than 500,000 years ago in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and certainly less than 150,000 years ago in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. In the new work, researchers used bones recovered from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Swartkrans cave, well-known for providing remains of <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> erectus and the ape-man robustus. To make sure they could identify signs of ancient burning, researchers took a fresh leg bone from a South African antelope called a hartebeest, and heated bone slices to different temperatures. Then they used the chemical and microscopic characteristics found in the heated slices to analyze the fossils. They concluded that 270 fossil fragments had been burnt, with most identifiable ones from antelope. Fragments from zebra, warthog, baboon and a finger bone of robustus were also identified. The robustus bone does not necessarily mean an ape-man was eaten, since the purpose of the fires is unknown, <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON> said. The fragments' color and structure showed they had been heated to a range of temperatures similar to that recorded in experimental campfires set by Brain. The experimental fires used what was probably the most common wood in the vicinity in ancient days, <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON> said. In the interview, <PERSON> Sillen </PERSON> said no burnt bones were found in older sections of the cave even though the conditions for deposition of fossils were identical. That suggests the burnt fragments mark the beginning of the use of fire, he said. <PERSON> Delson </PERSON> said the idea that the fragments burned in natural fires rather than deliberate blazes can not be ruled out. But <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> who has studied the ancient inhabitants of the Swartkrans cave, said he believes the fires were deliberate. `` It's highly unlikely that these bones would have been burned in a naturally occuring situation,'' he said. Range fires would not have reached the campfire-like temperatures identified for the bone fragments, he said. In addition, <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> erectus was known to use fire elsewhere, he said. <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> erectus appeared about 1.6 million years ago and evolved into a more advanced form by about 250,000 years ago. <PERSON> Robustus </PERSON> appeared about 2.5 million years ago and survived until at least 1 million years ago before extinction.

 <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON>, one of the first seven Mercury astronauts, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> no longer leads the world in space technology and should renew its commitment to space exploration. In an address at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy Tuesday night, the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain called on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to make building a space station the top priority of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program. Such a station could serve as a port for manned and unmanned exploratory missions to other planets and their moons, said <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON>, 65. <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON>, a 1946 academy graduate who is now a business executive, wore a `` Beat Army'' pin _ the same message he carried on a placard during a 1965 Gemini mission. The annual <ORGANIZATION> Army-Navy </ORGANIZATION> football game is this weekend. <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON> said the Skylab project marked the beginning of the decline of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. Budget cuts forced the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to allow Skylab to break up in orbit and no serious financial commitment has been made since, he said. The former astronaut, speaking on the eve of the launching of the secret military shuttle <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, said space shuttle missions have had `` no place to go. ... They were just supposed to go into outer space and come home. We did that 25 years ago.'' <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s space program for its long-range goals. The Soviets have done extensive research on how weightlessness affects humans and have worked to develop ships that can stay in orbit for years, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has attempted neither, he said. <PERSON> Schirra </PERSON> was selected as a Mercury astronaut in April 1959. In 1962, he became the fifth astronaut to fly in space.

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the bustle of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main bazaar, young women wearing blue jeans under their traditional Islamic chador robes stroll past crippled war veterans hobbling on rickety wooden crutches between merchant stalls. A few blocks away, curious children and young people flock to gaze at the magnificent former residence of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Some people on the streets of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> openly indicated their displeasure with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary government, which toppled the shah in 1979. A book vendor asked for an up-to-date city guidebook told a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> reporter, `` There has been nothing like that since the revolution.'' The merchant then held up a tattered guidebook dating back before the Islamic revolution. She pointed to a photograph in the book of the shah's family. The picture had been crossed out with thick black censorship marks. `` It really is a shame,'' the book vendor said angrily. Journalists accompanying West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were not allowed to tour the city freely or take pictures during the three-day state visit that ended Tuesday. But the glimpses they were allowed showed <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is a city full of contrasts. The Westerners witnessed clear evidence of Moslem fundamentalism, but also signs of modernism. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been making efforts to increase its contacts with some Western nations, such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as it tries to recover from its crippling eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after a cease-fire. But West German businessmen who accompanied <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said it is still not certain whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commitment to conservative Moslem principles will hinder efforts to build up the country. `` Whoever plans to invest here must carefully weigh each step,'' said <PERSON> Rochus-Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiherr </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Luettwitz </PERSON>, a West German involved in business discussions with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. There are signs everywhere that a fundamentalist Islamic philosophy that has governed life in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s ouster still holds sway. Iranian Revolutionary Guards carrying automatic rifles were plainly visible on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s streets, watching the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists to make sure they did not violate any of the restrictions under which their presence was permitted. The Iranian government's disdain for the late shah, who was friendly with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, becomes bitterly clear with a visit to the grand palace where he and his family had lived. Pictures of the shah have been turned upside-down inside the rooms of the palace, now a museum. Photographs showing poverty and squalor during the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s rule have been placed near tables exhibiting valuables once owned by the former ruler. Plaques tell visitors the purpose of rooms in the palace during the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s reign, but in a belittling fashion. `` Former Working Room of the Shah Who Fled,'' reads one plaque. But along with such clear evidence of Moslem fundamentalism, there are also signs <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s people do not totally reject Western ways. Many of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s young women wear blue jeans or short skirts under their traditional black chador robes, the fabric pushed back just enough on their foreheads to reveal a lock or two of hair. Several young women were also wearing high-heeled shoes. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> residents on the streets did not stare at the Western visitors but actually seemed to welcome them. There were also signs of the devastating war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Crippled young men hobbled along the streets and the Westerners saw empty lots where they were told bombed-out homes once stood. There are also signs of stymied progress within <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Just behind the Hotel Esteghlal, called the Royal Tehran Hilton before the 1979 revolution, chickens raced among building materials at the site of an uncompleted structure. Rusty steel girders were scattered on the ground, giving the impression the structure had not been worked on for some time. Inside the hotel itself, the climate-control system was able to churn out only humid blasts of air. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and his entourage were greeted with open arms by Iranian officials. But Western journalists were told through the West German Embassy that while in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> they would be permitted to write only about <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s meetings and that their visas were valid only for the duration of the official visit. In addition, it was made clear to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> photographers that the Iranians would not allow pictures to be taken of life on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s streets

 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will not be a scapegoat for what it calls politically motivated opposition in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to a nuclear power plant it built under former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says the $ 2.3 billion plant 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> province is unsafe in part because of its design and its location on an earthquake fault near a volcano. Her government has said it plans to sue <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> for damages and breach of contract regarding the plant, which never went into operation because of alleged safety defects. Her legal adviser, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, said in late October that a lawsuit was ready and likely would be filed within a month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An agreement barring either the government or the company from taking legal action was due to expire Thursday. Formal announcement of the lawsuit was scheduled Thursday in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for 2:30 p.m. -LRB- 1:30 a.m. EST -RRB- at the presidential palace. `` What we're finding here are the results of a political policy that came to life when they were running for office,'' said <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> nuclear fuels unit. `` They now feel they have a political albatross around their neck and they're trying to blame us.'' The reactor's opponents also allege that bribes were paid over the awarding of the prime contract. `` We won fairly and squarly,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> and Deputy General Counsel <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briskman </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials have acknowledged during private talks that no matter how safe the plant is, they do n't intend to allow nuclear power production in the country. `` Safety has nothing to do with it,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. With all but $ 20 million to $ 30 million still due from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for the power plant, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> could walk away from the 10-year-old controversy, said <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>. The bigger risk perhaps is damage to the company's international standing as a designer and builder of nuclear power plants. `` All over the world we have built plants, and we have n't had this problem. If they do n't want to operate this plant, that's they're decision, but do n't make <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> a scapegoat,'' he said `` <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> will not be a scapegoat.'' The company cited investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that produced no evidence warranting charges. Further, a safety study commissioned by the Aquino government concluded that the plant is safe, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said. A trade journal published a draft of that report. The government says the final report concludes otherwise, but officials have refused to release the document. The 620-megawatt plant, powered by a Westinghouse-pressurized water reactor, was completed three years ago. In its early stages, the project was shaken by allegations of kickbacks to officials of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime and by safety concerns. Communist rebels have bombed transmission towers leading from the plant, and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap. The plant's corps of operators has largely disbanded, and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has only a handful of employees still in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. Yet the cost of the plant continues rising, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said. Interest on the loans the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> took to build cost an estimated $ 300,000 per day.

Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who also testified, said that failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence by foreigners in the value of the dollar, sparking higher interest rates and possibly a severe recession in this country. `` We are, entirely unnecessarily in my view, undercutting the economic foundation of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> world leadership,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should submit his own spending blueprint no later than mid-February and this should be followed by the recommendations of the economic commission by March 1. `` We do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` The problems wo n't wait indefinitely while people try to read our lips or read our minds.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other Democrats want to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be specific on how he would cut the deficit without raising taxes while still keeping his other campaign promises to boost spending in such areas as education, day care and environmental cleanup. They fear that unless the president-elect is forced to spell out how his spending cuts would work, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will try later to blame <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for boosting taxes while ignoring his `` flexible freeze'' approach. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week he intends to appoint people to begin deficit negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on his first day in office, but he has not said whether he will submit his own spending plan or simply use President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final budget as the starting point for discussions. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not want to submit a separate budget then <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should consider allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to incorporate his own recommendations into the administration's 1990 budget, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will submit on Jan. 9. `` This would be an act of smooth transition and the kind of resolute leadership which could inspire greater confidence both from the public and from financial markets at home and abroad,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, in his testimony, sounded many of the same warnings as his successor at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. In testimomy before the commission two weeks ago, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the deficit had begun to `` eat away at the foundations of our economic strength, and the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said since the current economic recovery began in late 1982 the country has been on a consumption binge, fueled by the huge budget deficits and large flows of foreign capital into the country. To keep foreigners from losing confidence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said the government needed to launch a credible deficit reduction program that would bring the deficit down by between $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion each year until the budget reaches surplus. The deficit in the last fiscal year was $ 155.1 billion. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said he would favor using a gasoline tax to raise extra revenues, saying each 1-cent-per-gallon boost in the tax raises $ 1 billion annually in new revenues. This tax would promote conservation, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said, thus reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil and helping to trim <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficits. The Council on Competitiveness, composed of 157 chief executives from business, organized labor and higher education, presented the commission with a list of proposals to trim the deficit by $ 120 billion by 1993 with a combination of spending cuts and $ 48 billion in higher taxes. Among the taxes the council suggested were a boost in excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, which would raise $ 8 billion annually; a 20-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, which would raise $ 20 billion annually; and higher income tax rates for families earning more than $ 220,350 a year, which could bring in $ 7 billion in additional revenues, the council said. Former Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Giaimo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., and co-chairman of the Committee for a <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said a nationwide series of town meetings had shown him that Americans support balancing the budget, even it means tax increases and a freeze in cost-of-living hikes for Social Security <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, presented the commission with a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> transition report which came to the conclusion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s flexible freeze would not be enough to eliminate the deficit and consideration would have to be given to increasing taxes. `` When the long-term health of our nation's economy is at stake, everything must be negotiable, including defense spending, entitlements and taxes,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> has registered his objections to proposals by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to cut Medicaid payments to states next year and to reduce the growth in spending on AIDS. In a letter <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> wrote to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, reported in Thursday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the secretary called the <ORGANIZATION> Medicaid </ORGANIZATION> proposal `` unrealistic.'' <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> wants to slash federal Medicaid payments to states by $ 1.1 billion, and to allow AIDS spending to grow from $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.6 billion. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> wants the government to spend $ 1.9 billion on AIDS.

 A soldier went berserk after a quarrel with his girlfriend, firing a rifle at neighbors and villagers and killing seven people, the military said today. The killer surrendered after the rampage, in which nine people were injured, the military said. The report said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Negro </PERSON>, a constable at the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, went on the killing spree after he left his girlfriend's home Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> province 360 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The military said the violence was triggered by a `` love problem'' between Negro and the woman, who was not identified. After <PERSON> Negro </PERSON> left his girlfriend's home, he began firing his semiautomatic rifle at neighbors in the coastal village. Five people were killed and five others injured, the report said. <PERSON> Negro </PERSON> then hitched a ride in a jeep to nearby <LOCATION> Talisay </LOCATION> town. While en route, he opened fire on a group of men in <LOCATION> Lawaan </LOCATION> village, killing two and wounding four, the report added. He surrendered later and was undergoing interrogation, the report said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 151-2 to condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for not letting <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> enter the country and gave it until today to reverse the decision. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they would not budge. If <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman, is not granted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations will offer a resolution to reconvene the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can address it. Diplomats said passage was assured. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposed Wednesday's condemnation. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained because it said the criticism was too harsh, but all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies supported the denunciation. The vote was conducted in a rare and dramatic roll call, requested by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. In a departure from the standard electronic voting, delegates voted in the official <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> languages: Arabic, English, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish. They called out `` Na'm,'' `` Yes,'' `` <PERSON> Zan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>,'' `` 0ui,'' `` Da,'' `` Si,'' and in the case of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` No.'' Absent from the roll call were <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevis </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The resolution asked <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to inform the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> by tonight of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not change its mind. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa on security grounds, saying he condones and encourages terrorism perpetrated by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had said he wanted to explain to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> the position taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in its recent meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. The council _ the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile _ implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, accepting key <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> calling for negotiations with states in the region. Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> does not receive a visa, `` it will constitute a grievous blow to the process of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' `` I feel very pained to see that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the odd couple with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, ambassador of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the resolution. `` We are hopeful the international outcry against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position will jolt the subsequent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration into a reassessment of its policies of bias toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. Arab diplomats said they would quickly introduce a resolution to shift the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in mid-December. The second resolution would likely be voted on by early next week, and the diplomats said they had the votes to pass it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it does not oppose a move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and would participate in debate there. Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Verner </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said plans were already under way to move the assembly to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the European headquarters of the world body. It would be the first time the assembly has moved as an act of protest. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has had a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since 1975 and holds non-voting observer status. It is considered the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and is invited to speak on all debates concerning Palestinians and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Under the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is required to grant visas to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats and invitees on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> business. In debate Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assertion that the Headquarters Agreement allows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protect its security interests. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on the Palestinian issue originally was scheduled today, Friday and Dec. 6 but has been postponed. Diplomatic sources said the week of Dec. 12-16 would be the most likely time for the session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The resolution on moving must first be heard by a 16-member budgetary advisory committee because it has financial implications. It then would go to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s finance committee, formally called the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which would vote on it and send it to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for action. The cost of the move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was not known, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources have said it would be relatively modest, perhaps $ 150,000, covering the travel of a small number of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel. Most nations would send their <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> ambassadors to the session.

 Buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> won the free-for-all takeover war for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday with a record $ 24.53 billion offer for the cigarette-and-food giant. The $ 109-a-share offer shattered a rival effort by an <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> management group and came in a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left the unprecedented auction for the company in utter confusion. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 81 in cash, $ 18 in stock and additional securities worth $ 10 beat out a last-minute offer valued at $ 112, or $ 25.2 billion, by the management group that instigated the takeover struggle last month at a price that was $ 8.3 billion cheaper. The value of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was nearly double that of the previous record, a $ 13.4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in March 1984. Although the management offer looked higher in face value, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that its board of directors concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer was worth substantially the same. `` The Board of Directors of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, by unanimous vote of all directors present, adopted the <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> offer as being in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, the undisputed leader in the business of buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, issued a statement that it was pleased with the decision that capped the biggest takeover in history. `` We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so that the employees of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, its consumers and suppliers and the communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return to normal and stability will be restored,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two principals, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said in the statement. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s victory caps a struggle that broke all previous takeover records and raised major questions about the frenzy of leveraged buyouts and other debt-financed restructurings transforming much of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The end of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> battle also signaled a spectacular defeat by its chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who began the takeover struggle last month with a $ 75 a share offer that he later raised four times. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, known as a scrappy adversary unafraid of taking risks, had no immediate comment on <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s victory. It was n't immediately clear whether he would take another tack in what has been an unpredictable battle Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group made an 11th-hour effort to raise its bid from $ 101 a share to $ 108 a share after a company-decreed deadline for all offers had expired. The move temporarily upended a $ 106-a-share, $ 23.8 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> that was about to be approved, sources said. That development made the already unwieldy auction even more chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were receiving equal treatment. It also sent <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock roaring higher, partly in anticipation that the unprecedented auction might be prolonged yet again. Sources familiar with the bidding also said the offer of a third contender, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was rejected as too tentative, although the bidder valued it as high as $ 115 a share or $ 25.87 billion. A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash each bidder intended to pay, because the value of the securities segment is difficult to determine. These securities often are worth less than their face amount. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stock surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> briefly halted trading when buy orders overwhelmed sell orders on Wednesday. The stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up $ 2.25 to $ 93 on volume exceeding 6.7 million shares. RJR stock was trading at less than $ 56 a share when the battle began in late October. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group incited the battle when he proposed to take the nation's 19th-largest industrial company private via a leveraged buyout. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors then put the company up for sale to attract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction Nov. 18-20. They decided to prolong it because the offers received were too vague and inadequate. RJR is one of the largest consumer products companies, with more than 120,000 employees. It makes well-known brands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal to Life Savers candy.

<HEAD>Pentagon Severs Military Computer Network From Academic Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, citing technical difficulties, has cut links for several days between an unclassified military computer network and a nationwide academic and corporate computer network, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Several computer security experts said Wednesday that they had been told by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials that the network connection was severed after an unknown intruder illegally gained entry recently to several computers operated by the military and defense contractors, according to the Times. The computer specialists said they thought the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> broke the connection, which permits military and academic researchers to exchange information, while it tried to eliminate a security flaw in the computers in the military network, the newspaper reported. An unidentified spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> told the Times in a statement that the links between the two networks were cut at 10 p.m. Monday and were expected to be restored Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> apparently acted after a computer at the <ORGANIZATION> Mitre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, company with several military contracts, was illegally entered several times during the past month, according to the Times. Officials at several universities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said their computers had been used by the intruder to reach the Mitre computer. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mitre, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that one of the company's computers had been entered. But she said no classified or sensitive information had been handled by the computers involved and the problem was fixed within hours of being detected. The military computer network, known as Milnet, is linked through seven gateways to another larger computer network, Arpanet, which was jammed last month by a rogue program introduced by a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student. The decision to disconnect the military computers upset a number of computer users around the country. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochlis </PERSON>, assistant network manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said that a computer user complained Tuesday night that `` he could not send mail.'' `` Initially we were given the run around, but eventually they unofficially confirmed to us that the shutoff was security related,'' he added.

<HEAD>Authorities Investigating Alleged Scheme To Ship Nerve Gas To Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities are investigating an alleged scheme to illegally ship a chemical used to make nerve gas to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported. Documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> say a company in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> attempted to ship thiodiglycol, a chemical precursor of mustard gas, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> said in its Thursday editions. The documents were filed in an application for a search warrant which sought telexes, computer printouts and records of messages between <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, maker of the chemical, and two companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. In the 8-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, both sides _ but particularly <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ were accused of using chemical weapons. Both sides denied using the weapons, which are outlawed under the Geneva Convention. Thiodiglycol has permissible applications in the textile industry, but its export is restricted under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export laws `` to prevent diversion to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for use in chemical warfare,'' the affidavit says. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> outlined the scheme in a 14-page affidavit file in their application for the search warrant. The affidavit says <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> began shipping thiodiglycol in February 1987 for <ORGANIZATION> Colimex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>, a West German company now called <ORGANIZATION> Chemco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. KG <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION>'s shipping documents referred to the cargo by its trade name, <PERSON> Kromfax </PERSON>, rather by its chemical name. The documents had been manipulated to make it possible to divert the cargo to <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, in violation of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Export Administration Regulations, the affidavit says. The cargo began its journey by barge from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, where customs agents intercepted it and switched the Kromfax drums with drums of water. Customs agents then monitored the cargo's route to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and its transshipment to <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>. In late June, agents with the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> learned from customs officials in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> that the shipment had been transferred to an Iranian flagship named `` SS <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ekram.''

<HEAD>Chicken, Fresh Veggies Will be Best Food Buys in 1989</HEAD>

 Chicken, rather than beef and pork, and fresh vegetables rather than canned or frozen ones are likely to be the best bargains for consumers in 1989, according to a top <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> food economist. Prices for eggs are likely to shoot upward as much as 20 percent, and substantial price increases for fresh fruits, cereals and bakery products also can be expected, department economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> says in a 1989 outlook report issued Wednesday. Overall, consumer food prices should rise about 3 to 5 percent next year, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said, roughly equaling this year's 4 percent increase. This year's rise means food prices have about kept pace with price increases in the rest of the economy, although consumers may notice their food bills more because of more frequent trips to the grocery store, he said. A variety of factors influence food costs, including the amount farmers make for the raw commodities, the costs of packaging materials, and charges for processing and distribution. In 1988, packaging cost increases were the main contributor to a 5 percent increase in processing and distribution expense, while farmers averaged 3.5 percent more for their raw products. For 1989, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said increases in egg prices will be the sharpest in the marketbasket, 15 to 20 percent, in part because of a squeeze produced by increased use of eggs in processing and a decline in production because of higher feed costs and poor returns to producers. Other steep increases are likely in fresh fruits, which may go up 6 to 9 percent because of strong consumer demand both domestically and in the export market. Orange prices are likely to remain strong because of growing purchases by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and a smaller apple crop will lead to higher prices there. Continued effects of the 1988 drought will be felt in the area of cereals and bakery products, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. Prices are expected to rise 4 to 7 percent next year due to a combination of grain price increases and strengthened demand from health-conscious consumers who see cereals as a good and easy-to-prepare nutrition source. The biggest bargain for shoppers, compared to current prices, will be in poultry, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. Growing supplies will bring prices down by at least 4 percent and possibly as much as 7 percent, he said. Beef production next year is likely to drop by 6 to 8 percent, leading to a moderate 1 to 3 percent price increase, similar to that expected for pork. Prices for fresh vegetables, which climbed this year because of the drought, will show little change next year because of expanding production, the economist forecast. <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said he expects an increase in the range of 0 to 3 percent, compared to a 4 to 7 percent increase for processed vegetables.

 Prices farmers received for raw products in November declined slightly from a month earlier but remained nearly 8 percent above their level of a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report Wednesday that lower prices for hogs, corn, grapefruit and soybeans were partly offset by higher prices for tomatoes, potatoes, milk and sweet corn, resulting in an overall drop of nearly 1 percent for the month. In part driven by the summer's drought, prices received by farmers had been rising throughout most of 1988 until September, when the increase leveled off. November's decline was the first drop in the price index since February. Despite the decline of the overall price index, some commodities continued higher in November. Wheat, for example, rose an additional 6 cents per bushel to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm price average of $ 3.90 per bushel, the most since it was $ 3.95 in May 1981. Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were off just less than 1 percent from October. Hog prices, at $ 36 per hundredweight, were the lowest since June 1980, while beef cattle prices were unchanged at $ 67.10. Dairy products and eggs were higher, while broiler prices declined. Compared with November 1987, the index was up 5.6 percent. The department's all-crops price index for November, although unchanged from October, was up 11 percent from a year earlier. Prices of feed grain and hay as a group declined 3.7 percent from last month and averaged 49 percent above the year-earlier level. Prices of commercial vegetables were up 22 percent from October but off 30 percent from November 1987. Tomatoes led the price increases, while carrot prices decreased slightly. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $ 57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Preliminary figures show that food prices for 1988 will average a 4 percent increase, about the same as last year's increase. For 1989, department economists are projecting food cost hikes in the same range, about 3 to 5 percent.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> may spend more time than his predecessors presiding over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a move that could spell conflict between the Democratic-controlled chamber and the administration. In an interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Wednesday also made his strongest public rejection of the notion that he will act as the link between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s far right. He also said his verbal gaffes during the campaign gave him some hard lessons about his own tendency to talk too much. Being besieged with questions and jokes about his qualifications was painful but educational, he said. `` I know myself better now. I'm a stronger person,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his focus now is on the task ahead _ picking his vice presidential staff during the transition period and working with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Since the election, conservatives have beaten a path to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s transition office seeking his ear <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> himself is an ardent conservative who has largely supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration positions during his eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've worked with a number of conservatives in the past; a lot of good friends are conservatives, but I'm not the point man for the conservatives in this administration. ... You wo n't see me being the so-called spear carrier for all the so-called conservative issues,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also hinted that he may take a more active role in his official capacity as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, presiding over the Democratic-controlled chamber more frequently. `` It's certainly an option. ... There have been suggestions to me by many that I consider spending more time in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than my predecessors have. I have not made a decision on that,'' he said. The presiding officer has substantial discretion as to which senator to recognize for the purpose of offering amendments, bills and motions. Normally the chair is occupied by a member of the majority party. A Republican in charge could touch off partisan parliamentary warfare. The vice president may take the presiding chair at any time, and the presiding officer's decision to recognize a senator is not subject to a point of order or appeal under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said if he did decide to preside more often, it would not be done `` in a contentious manner.'' `` I would be fair and objective and do what the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should do to protect senators' rights, all senators' rights,'' he said During the interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was relaxed and friendly, but clearly weighing his words. He has not generally spoken to the press in depth since the election. He confessed to being `` far more careful of what I say today than six months ago.'' `` I also try to discipline myself when I get into a situation ... instead of being verbose, which is a tendency that I have, to be concise. Because verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things.'' Also on Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with retiring <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, a Republican who will appoint <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s replacement in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will resign effective Jan. 2 so his replacement can have seniority over other incoming senators. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> has not said whom he will appoint, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he made no recommendation. But he did not reject a reporter's suggestion that he favors Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s district representative in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from 1976 to 1980. Coats now represents <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s old congressional district. `` Obviously I think a lot of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>. He worked for me for four years. He's been a very good congressman from my old congressional district. He took my seat. We've had a long and strong personal and professional relationship,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. On another subject, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the vice presidential mansion in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> may need alterations before his family can move in after the inauguration. He said the house is not configured for a family with three children. It does have six bedrooms, but some of them now serve as offices and servants' quarters and some do not have closets. The Quayles will live at their home in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, until they can move into the official residence. Their three children _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 14, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 10 _ will continue attending public schools in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for the time being.

<HEAD>Drug War a Failure but Courts Overwhelmed, ABA Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The war on drugs is overwhelming a criminal justice system whose greatest problem is lack of resources, not legal protections afforded criminal suspects, a two-year <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> study concludes. `` The entire system is starved: police, prosecution, criminal defense, courts and corrections,'' says the report by an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee. `` As currently funded, the criminal justice system can not provide the quality of justice that the public legitimately expects and that the people working within the system wish to deliver.'' Less than 3 percent of all government spending in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> went to support civil and criminal justice activities in fiscal 1985, a previously released federal study has shown. Those already thin resources are being overwhelmed by a massive _ but largely unsuccessful _ battle against illegal drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel concluded. It said that while courts are increasingly clogged, the drug problem `` is growing worse, and ... law enforcement has been unable to control'' it. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> study noted political disputes about the Miranda decision but found relatively few problems in the field related to it. That decision, issued in 1966 by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said police must warn suspects of their right to remain silent and to consult with a lawyer before any questioning takes place. While the Miranda decision `` has sparked heated controversy on a political level, the restrictions itsaid. Eighty-seven percent of prosecutors surveyed for the study said no more than 5 percent of their cases were dismissed because of problems involving the Miranda requirements. The exclusionary rule _ under which evidence obtained illegally by police may not be used in court _ also has caused few major problems, the study concluded. Some police officials, in fact, told the panel that the demands of the exclusionary rule have promoted professionalism in the nation's police departments. Most prosecutors put the number of cases dismissed because of the exclusionary rule at 5 percent or less, while three-quarters of the judges and defense lawyers polled said suppression motions succeed just 10 percent or less of the time. The study was based on testimony from the legal community and a national telephone survey of police, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. It was compiled by a panel chaired by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON>, former chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watergate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor. The study said efforts to bring the nation's drug problem under control are swamping the criminal justice system. `` Police, prosecutors and judges told the committee that they have been unsuccessful in making a significant impact on the importation, sale and use of illegal drugs, despite devoting much of their resources to the arrest, prosecution and trial of drug offenders,'' the panel reported. `` These extraordinary efforts have instead distorted and overwhelmed the criminal justice system, crowding dockets and jails, and diluting law enforcement and judicial efforts to deal with other major criminal cases.'' The panel recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> set up a special commission to study and re-evaluate national, state and local strategies in dealing with the drug problem and to educate the public and lawmakers as well as government policymakers.

 Texans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have a tough time persuading their colleagues to spend the billions of dollars needed to build the super collider, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says. `` I'll be working very hard to get it funded,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be exceedingly difficult to get.'' Even when seven states were candidates for the potentially lucrative physics project, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was adamant about financing the super collider. It voted earlier this year to give the project $ 100 million _ less than one-third of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for $ 363 million _ and decreed none of the money could be spent on construction. `` It's going to be uphill and tough, and particularly now because it's just one state,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We had seven states working on it before.'' Now that a site in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has been chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the super collider, at least one member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from a state that lost its bid to host the project is questioning the feasibility of finding enough construction money. The super collider is expected to cost $ 4.4 billion, and to create thousands of construction and scientific jobs. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said last week that the superconducting super collider was in trouble and would likely be doomed by budget constraints and opposition from others in the scientific community `` And quite honestly, the way the program has been set up, the consequences are that there's really very limited support outside of one particular state,'' said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have n't said it's going to go down the drain, but it's in serious difficulty.'' He said it stood a chance of one or two in 10 of ever being built.

 A 20-year-old <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> resident wrote a top federal health official that the public reaction to disclosing he tested positive for the AIDS virus would end his life `` sooner than AIDS will probably take it.'' The letter from `` D'' _ his identity is known to <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials _ was among eight from people with AIDS being read today during a World AIDS Day ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` I live in the Bible Belt of our country,'' began the letter to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the No. 2 physician in the federal health department. `` I have lived most of my life in a small town in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

 The nation's nuclear power plants have become safer and more efficient over the last four years, according to the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The remarks by Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> came at ceremonies Wednesday to dedicate an 18-story headquarters building for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. `` I am pleased to report that we are seeing evidence that overall performance is improving,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> told the gathering. Spokesmen for anti-nuclear groups challenged <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>'s upbeat assessment, with one contending that the situation with power reactors amounted to a `` mixed bag'' of improvements and problem areas. `` From 1984 until now, there has been a clear and definite improvement,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> began an analysis in that year of safety indicators. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said there had been reductions in `` significant operating events'' at power reactors, unplanned automatic shutdowns, safety system activations, `` precursor events'' signaling the possibility of a major accident as well as exposure of workers to radiation. `` Along with this improvement in critical safety performance indicators, we have seen improvements in plant reliability and availability,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. `` Recent data shows an increase in the average capacity factors for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reactors from about 59 percent in 1986 to almost 67 percent in 1988.'' The capacity factor is the actual output of a plant compared with what it would generate if it operated at full power all the time. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopeck </PERSON> later provided the following specific figures for the performance indicators cited by <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>: _ `` Significant operating events,'' or major problems: 2.4 per operating reactor in 1985; 1.6 in 1986; and 0.8 in 1987. _ Unplanned automatic shutdowns: 5.24 per reactor in 1984; 5.04 in 1985; 3.96 in 1986; and 3.24 in 1987 _ Safety system activations: 2.76 per reactor in 1984; 2.6 in 1985; 2.04 in 1986; and 1.68 in 1987 _ Precursor events: a nationwide total of 17 in 1984; 10 in 1985; and 6 in 1986 _ Radiation exposure: 714 man-rem in 1984; 574 man-rem in 1985; 431 in 1986; and 425 in 1987 Man-rem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of people. For example, when 100 people receive an average exposure of 0.01 rem, that would result in a figure of 1 man-rem. Spokesmen for anti-nuclear groups said they had questions about <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>'s assessment of overall plant performance. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON> of Public Citizen, a Washington-based public interest group founded by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said: `` It's a mixed bag. There are some positives and there are some negatives. It's not fair or accurate for <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> to say everything is looking better because it's not.'' For example, <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON> said: `` On the radiation issue, what he said is true as far as it went, but it's not complete. The average dose per worker at nuclear power plants has decreased since 1984, but the number of workers exposed, on the other hand, has increased.'' He said the number of workers exposed has increased from 93,000 in 1985 to slightly more than 100,000 in 1986 and 104,000 workers in 1987. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotte </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, another Washington-based public interest group, said: `` There may be a slightly improving track record. However, there's no reason to be smug about it. ... It seems like every time they think something has been solved, they find a new problem.'' The new 286,000-square-foot <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters building, purchased by the government for $ 47.5 million, provides space for about 1,400 <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> employees. It marks an effort to consolidate operations of the agency, which previously were dispersed among 10 separate buildings. A second structure is to be built at the same <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> site by 1991 to accommodate the rest of the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area employees.

 Solidarity backers declared <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> the winner of an unprecedented TV debate in which he dueled with his official counterpart and urged the government to legalize the banned labor movement. `` This is a fantastic day, beautiful, which will be noted in the history of our country as a great victory for Solidarity,'' said film director <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON> after Wednesday night's showdown between the Solidarity chairman and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, head of the government's official trade unions. `` He was perfect, just perfect,'' a grinning <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a senior Solidarity adviser, said of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. It was the first time in five years that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had a chance to defend his federation on state-controlled television and his longest appearance ever on Polish TV. The exchange was broadcast live and uncensored. A clock was even placed in the background of the set to demonstrate that no deletions were made. In the 43-minute debate, an animated <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke rapidly, challenging authorities to legalize Solidarity. He urged the official unions to join Solidarity in `` creating freedom.'' He also said <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, as a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> All-Poland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, should press for the legalization of the outlawed labor movement. `` If you can make a man's decision that there is a place for Solidarity, we will immediately roll up our sleeves and we will begin working hard for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, because time is running out,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the 59-year-old former steelworker. Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent union federation, was crushed under martial law in 1981 and banned in 1982. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>'s group, known by its Polish initials OPZZ, was created by the government in 1982 to replace it. The official unions say they have 7 million members, including 4.5 million former Solidarity members. Solidarity was founded during a turbulent series of strikes in 1980. In its heyday, it said it had 10 million members. In the debate, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said proposed talks between the opposition and government could begin when officials acknowledge Solidarity's right to exist After the broadcast, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters he suffered from a severe case of flu that hampered his performance and made him `` too impulsive.'' <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, interviewed as he left the debate set, said only: `` I have fulfilled my task. I am pleased that Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> accepted my invitation.'' The state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that although the two debaters disagreed, `` the very fact of the meeting is a good prognosis for overcoming barriers in reaching ... dialogue and national agreement.'' The debate brought thousands of rapt Poles to television sets. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Central Station, <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Streszynski </PERSON> missed his train to western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to watch. `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made great remarks. I waited seven years to hear them,'' he said afterward. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said during the debate that all socialist countries were in difficult straits and blamed their problems on a lack of `` pluralism,'' independent groups and ideas in public life. In a reference to changes under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said conditions had never been better for reform but that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> nevertheless was merely `` toddling in place.'' <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> said said each enterprise should have only one trade union to avoid dividing the workforce. He said some Solidarity backers have shouted anti-state slogans like `` Down with the Commune,'' which he called `` terrifying.'' `` Our society must have peace, at least social peace, at least security for society,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Even before <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected president, his personnel chief was closeted with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, going over hundreds of sheets of paper that will help shape the staffing of the new administration. It was part of a project initiated by the Office of Presidential Personnel designed in part to provide the incoming president with an unprecedented amount of information about the nature and requirements of the jobs he must fill. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a White House staffer in three past <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations, discussed the project in his new book, `` Ring of Power,'' saying, `` Such interpresidential foresightedness shows the modern <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at its best.'' `` A catalogue of all the full-time and part-time presidentially appointed jobs in the Executive Branch - their titles, terms, pay levels, and in brief their current duties - is being saved for the recruiters who, serving the next president, will occupy the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> chairs,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. `` The catalogues may even be available to the candidates following the conventions,'' he wrote. It did n't turn out quite that way, though. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s people were poring over the documents before Nov. 8, aides to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> never even got a peek. `` We never heard from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, director of presidential personnel, said in an interview. `` They never called.'' He conceded he did n't call them, either, but said: `` They knew where I was. They knew my number.'' He said the information was shared with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff `` in anticipation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory.'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition personnel director, `` just about the time of the election - I think we did some before and some after.'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, briefing reporters Wednesday, said, `` The people whom we are hiring right now to go to work on ... recommending the jobs to be filled on behalf of the president-elect have as much material preparation as has ever been the case before.'' `` One of the resources available to me that, frankly, was n't available to my counterpart on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, was being able to spend 12 different sessions in the White House with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> and his people, going over just what is the current presidential personnel system,'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said Too often in the past, said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, the system used was one known by the acronym BOGSAT, which he said stands for `` bunch of guys sitting around a table.'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said there are 551 Executive Branch positions, not counting 135 ambassadors, filled by presidential appointment subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. `` We went through each one in detail with my associate director and so we probably spent 20 or 30 hours with <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> going through these,'' he said. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> also said that at the request of both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his office called all presidential appointees and asked them: `` Do you want to continue in your present job? And are there other jobs you are interested in?'' He said he met with <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> last week and went over the responses, in which `` a great percentage'' said they either wanted to keep their present job or take a new job in the administration. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said he is following up on this by speaking to the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries and asking them for `` their very candid appraisal of each of those individuals: Who are the ones whose resignations we should accept and let return to the private sector? Who are those who are doing such a good job or have such unique skills that they should stay in their present job?'' The latter, he added, `` will be, as Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, the exception rather than the rule.''

<HEAD>Would-be Defense Secretary Registered As Lobbyist For Defense

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the former senator and leading candidate to be Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> in the next administration, is registered as a lobbyist for five large defense companies, according to a Tower associate and congressional records. Tower, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is the chief candidate to take over the top Pentagon spot, but President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't yet made a final decision, according to sources speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity. Some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides oppose Tower because they fear he would n't push hard enough to reform the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s problem-plagued system for buying weapons, the sources said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped the question Wednesday. Asked by reporters about reports of staff dissension over Tower, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only, `` stay tuned,'' repeating his favorite refrain on administration nominations. He said `` all is tranquil'' within his staff. Representatives of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Tower are negotiating over who might be named to high-level <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> jobs, the sources said. Tower, 63, retired from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after a 24-year career in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, capped by his chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. After he retired, Tower was named by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team negotiating with the Soviets for deep cuts in the U.S.-Soviet arsenals of long-range weapons. He quit after 14 months in that post and set up a consulting firm, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. Early this year, the White House asked Tower to help lobby his former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to ratify the treaty ridding <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of medium-range nuclear weapons, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON>, a Tower associate. Tower did not return telephone calls. But <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON> said the company registered Feb. 2 as a lobbyist because Tower did n't want any conflict-of-interest questions raised about his work on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, as the agreement is known. <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> is registered as a lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Tower is a consultant to the five firms, <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON> said, and as such would not be required to register as a lobbyist unless he lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on their behalf. `` We registered because the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> asked for our help on the INF treaty and we were working as consultants for these companies at the same time,'' said <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON>. `` The companies make some components which go into systems that are used for weapons affected by the treaty,'' he explained. `` Tower wanted to be absolutely clear and up front about his connections with the companies and he did n't want anybody saying that the reason Tower was saying this or that about the treaty was because it would have helped one of his clients.'' <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON> declined to say what the firm was paid by the five companies. But Tower might be expected to have received more than $ 50,000 annually from each, according to a defense contractor who spoke Wednesday on condition he not be named. Tower is also a member of the board of directors of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of British Aerospace. That subsidiary is based in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>.

 Political eccentric <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s `` security'' fund was used to pay for items including a piano, haircuts, flowers, shoes and cufflinks, according to testimony in his tax fraud trial <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> financial officer <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> acknowledged on Wednesday that the movement's security account paid for items which _ according to prosecutors _ should have been declared as taxable income. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s trial continues today in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where he is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A grand jury accused <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> of failing to declare as income the personal and household expenses financed by his organizations, and of refusing to file federal tax returns since 1979. By calling Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> to the stand, prosecutors continued using a strategy of compelling <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aides to testify about the movement's finances under grants of limited immunity from prosecution. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>'s testimony would not only support the tax count, but charges that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six co-defendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not repaying their loans to his organizations. The personal expenditures cited by Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> were made while the LaRouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was available to repay some $ 25 million of the more than $ 30 million lent to the movement. About $ 5 million was repaid, according to earlier testimony. Trying to rebut the personal expense testimony, defense lawyers attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was for legitimate security and research purposes _ not for his personal benefit. The defense effort was cut short, however, by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He refused to allow any defense questioning of Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> on the movement's need for consultants, who were paid weekly, monthly, daily, and flat payments. Defense lawyers described the consultants as national security experts. The defense struck out, too, when it tried to question the witness about payments for security protection for two Latin American members of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s organization. The defense contended they were threatened by drug dealers, and were given refuge with their families in <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, estate. The government, on the other hand, was permitted to introduce a memo prepared by Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, in which she said listing consultant payments under `` legal investigations, services rendered for personal research'' was `` not a particularly defensible position under <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny.'' Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> testified that she really did n't know if the expenses were listed improperly under <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> regulations. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the prosecutor, had Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> read for jurors some of the expenses from LaRouche's `` security'' fund, which was designed for the personal security of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, his aides and his guests. Among the items was a $ 7,000 piano and furniture for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION> estate; cufflinks, for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>; shoes for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helga </PERSON>; film; clothes for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>; flowers; luggage costing $ 415.96; a hairdresser appointment for Mrs. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and a $ 10 haircut for LaRouche; a $ 25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person, and reimbursement for a wine purchase Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> said the furniture and piano were for a building where the LaRouche organization scheduled political and cultural events. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political movement embraces a number of unorthodox positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving such figures as former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and the queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Another LaRouche finance officer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, testified Wednesday that he thought <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> might be responsible for the movement's financial problems. <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said he based his theory, in part, on a letter from <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, which the LaRouche organization obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> wrote, `` Because these people have been getting increasingly obnoxious, I have taken the liberty of asking my lawyer, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, to get in touch with you to ask your advice, especially with respect to security.'' <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> testified that he sent a memo to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> about <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> in October 1984, in the midst of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s second of three presidential campaigns. `` You stated in the memo that <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> was behind the actions'' to hurt the LaRouche organization financially, asked Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` It was the primary but not the only suggestion I made,'' Welsh testified. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization. Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines of $ 3.25 million for LaRouche. The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987. On trial with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> are his chief fund-raiser, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; his legal adviser, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and four fund-raisers: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

 A probe into last summer's disappearance of a young Marine during training maneuvers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is being reopened and three officers involved in the mystery face court-martial, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> says. The commandant of the corps, Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, on Wednesday ordered a reopening of the investigation into the disappearance of <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Corporal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The Marines also announced that <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s squad leader, platoon sergeant and a third officer would face court-martial on various charges in trials expected to begin in about two weeks. <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, 19, was helping direct vehicles at <LOCATION> Twentynine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a Marine base, during combat maneuvers the night of last Aug. 30. The infantryman, who had been stationed at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was reported missing two days later and has not been seen since. Hundreds of Marines using dogs searched the base and the surrounding area for several days and found nothing but a pack and some rocks positioned into the shape of an arrow. A second search, conducted several weeks later, also found nothing. The new investigation into <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s disappearance is expected to last one month, said <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON>. The Marines said that <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s squad leader, Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON>, will be tried on charges of dereliction of duty and unauthorized absence. Sgt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s platoon sergeant, was also charged with dereliction of duty.

In addition, a platoon leader and company commander have been relieved of their commands and reprimanded. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said the names of the two officers were not being released. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said she could provide no further details on the alleged actions by the accused officers that resulted in the charges. The three courts-martial will be conducted at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached On New Contract for Guild-Covered Staff at AP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Associated Press and the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement covering 1,400 employees, including the news service's domestic reporting and editing staff. The two-year accord came minutes before midnight Wednesday, when the preceding pact was to expire. The Guild's negotiating committee voted to recommend the agreement for approval by its membership. The new contract provides the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> news staff with a top-minimum salary of $ 720 per week, after increases of $ 27 a week in the first year and $ 25 a week in the second year. In addition, the agreement provided significant increases for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s non-news personnel. Among fringe benefit improvements, the contract provides for extension of dental health coverage to cover part of the cost of orthodontic treatment, and a doubling of the eye-care reimbursement benefit to $ 100 annually. New benefits were creation of a non-matching 401K retirement savings plan and establishment of an account to provide tax deferred benefits to staffers making arrangements for child care or other dependent care. <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> also established a 100 percent reimbursement for certain preventive cancer screening tests. Aside from the general increase, the agreement also provides for improvements in the economic differential received by <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> news staffers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Staffers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> received increases of $ 10 in the first year and $ 12 in the second year, providing a total differential of $ 87. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the increase was $ 5 in the first year and $ 7 in the second year, providing a total differential of $ 45. The contract agreement also resolved a unit clarification petition filed by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> and a companion petition filed by the Guild. The petitions asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to clarify the supervisory status of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> editors and correspondents, a subject that had been considered but not definitively resolved by the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. The Guild and the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> agreed that all news editors and correspondents supervising three or more employes would be exempt from Guild jurisdiction and thus become members of AP management. Correspondents who supervise smaller <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> operations would remain in <LOCATION> Guild </LOCATION> jurisdiction, the parties agreed. <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> hearings, set to begin in December, will be canceled as a result of the agreement, in which the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> said news editors or correspondents who wished to maintain their place in the Guild bargaining unit could relinquish their supervisory duties and transfer to regular staff positions. The parties also resolved several significant pension issues, striking a mandatory contribution clause that required the AP to contribute $ 2,881 per week to a pension trust that was already fully funded. The parties further agreed that funds held in the AP account in The Newspaper Guild Commingled Fund could be used for payments of pension benefits and expenses, retroactive through 1988. Bargaining on the contract began in October. The guild was represented by AP news staffers from around the nation who are members of the union.

<TEXT>
 Security at the Kennedy Space Center was increased to protect the shuttle Atlantis and its military secrets from terrorists, spies and even <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalists. `` Security is additive to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> flights,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>, deputy director for security services, said Wednesday. `` We always have security for any shuttle flight as a national resource. For a DOD launch, people ca n't access areas where they would see classified data.'' Information about the launch _ the third entirely military shuttle mission _ was sharply restricted, with none of the usual pre-flight briefings and news conferences. The precise liftoff time was to be kept secret until nine minutes before launch. German shepherds trained to sniff out bombs checked the bags of some journalists and other workers arriving before the launch. News media organizations setting up remote unmanned cameras to photograph the Atlantis liftoff had to sign <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> releases Wednesday giving up their film in case of an accident that could allow photographs of the payload _ believed to be a $ 500 million spy satellite. The Associated Press and The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> refused to sign the release and were n't allow to place their cameras. `` We are trying to make it as hard as possible for potential adversaries to find out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>. `` We do what we do because it serves the best interests of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> security force boosts the number of personnel on duty for a military launch by about 25 percent, <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said, with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> paying for the extra guard. He said more than 100 security personnel, from gate guards to plainsclothes investigators, were assigned to the Atlantis launch. The gate guards carry revolvers and Special Weapons and Tactics teams have automatic weapons. <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said he does n't recall any major security problems during a shuttle mission, although guards arrested 186 protesters two years ago for trespassing on government property in a protest against the Trident 2 missile launch at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Guarding against terrorism is always a consideration, <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said, although the shuttle is n't considered a vulnerable target. `` I think that anytime you have a piece of hardware that is valued the amount of the shuttle is, that is a potential target, but we do n't have any intelligence to that effect,'' <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said. `` I do think it presents a rather difficult target,'' he said. In addition to the manned patrols, the mostly wild and swampy 140,000-acre space center terrain has its own natural guard force. `` We have about 7,000 alligators, some rattlesnakes, and some wild hogs,'' <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Third-grader <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told her classmates in a hushed voice how her grandmother looked at wedding pictures and could not remember the names of her own family members. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouelette </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> pupil, recalled how his neighbor, an elderly woman, `` forgot how to drive,'' and `` forgot how to cook.'' Like practically everyone in their coastal town of 1,850 residents, the pupils were talking about Alzheimer's disease as part of a day-long series of events Wednesday put together by educators, doctors and a drug company. `` This is a test to see how much you can educate an entire town in one day,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The program used coloring books, a mascot dog and movies to show how the debilitating ailment can be battled. For a few hours, the students put aside their reading, writing and arithmetic to look at a disease that may not afflict them for 60 years, if at all. The children wanted to know how Alzheimer's disease gets started and, as it happens, that was one question that could not be answered definitively. The purpose of the effort was not so much to understand how the disease works but to show how the loved ones of an Alzheimer's sufferer can, with patience, helpful advice and love, minimize the worst of the disease's effects <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, which is in the third year of a federal <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> grant intended to promote community programs, developed the Alzheimer's effort in meetings between school officials and <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who spends summers here. <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> manufactures Hydergine, a drug that can ease some symptoms of Alzheimer's in milder cases. For adults, Wednesday's program included discussions on `` positive approaches to aging,'' a film titled `` There Were Times Dear,'' dramatizing a family coping with Alzheimer's, and a lecture by Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershell </PERSON>, a specialist in geriatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Alzheimer's afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly Americans. Efforts are expanding to help them cope. Until recently, the focus was on patients, not their families. <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> is changing that emphasis because of mounting evidence that children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline of a loved one. A coloring book titled `` Helping Grandma,'' by <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> art teacher <PERSON> Betsey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, told the story of a grandmother who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss. `` Children are often kept in the dark about aging,'' said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. `` They automatically think that ` old' means ` sick.' But children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when spoken to directly on the subject.'' The point of the coloring book, geared toward elementary school children, is to `` teach them understanding and to teach them that what she needs is support.'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said a key problem with the disease is the failure to recognize that it is a problem. `` The feeling is that to be old is to be sick and to be old is to be confused,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. Children ask what is wrong with an elderly relative and `` parents say, ` Well, <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON>'s getting old.' That's not true.'' One of the first things relatives can do for those showing signs of memory loss or other dementia is encourage them to go to a doctor. Also, mature, well-behaved dogs from an animal shelter can provide some stability and love for an Alzheimer's sufferer, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, a black and white mongrel from a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> animal shelter, has become the national poster dog for the so-called human-animal bonding campaign, and he travels with <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> to events on the subject. The Alzheimer's event in this southern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> community was the second of its kind. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> tried out the program earlier this fall in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Slain Girl Had Been Kidnapped in Similar Incident in 1987, Officers

<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A five-year-old girl who was kidnapped from her home for the second time in two years was found dead of strangulation and massive head injuries beside a road, authorities say. The body of <PERSON> Lottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a kindergarten student, was found hours after she was kidnapped from her bedroom Wednesday, <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police said. She had been left beside an isolated road three miles away in neighboring Grand Prairie. Police said the girl had also been kidnapped from her home in 1987 by an unknown assailant and released. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, 23, told police that someone broke into the apartment through the child's bedroom window sometime between 2 a.m. Wednesday, when a live-in baby-sitter checked on the girl, and 8 a.m., when Ms. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> discovered her daughter missing. Ms. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> told authorities that the kidnapper had placed some stuffed animals under the covers on the girl's bed in an apparent attempt to make it appear that the girl was still in the bed. A baby-sitter, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 18, had been caring for the girl and her three-year-old brother while the mother worked at an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> diner. Neighbors told authorities they did not hear anything unusual during the night, although one said his dog started barking at 2 a.m. But he said he did not see anything unusual when he checked the area by looking through a window. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office ruled the death a homicide, saying that an autopsy determined that the girl died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, and `` crush force'' injuries to the head. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said evidence also indicated the girl had been run over by a vehicle. Police said they had no leads and no suspects in the case and could not say whether the homicide was related to the 1987 incident, in which the girl was found on June 22 wandering about five miles from her home. Then four, the child told police that a thin, black-haired man about 19 years old, driving a small brown car, had kidnapped her about 9:30 a.m. outside her apartment. The man released her an hour later, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Medical evidence indicated the girl may have been sexually assaulted in the earlier kidnapping, he said. Police never apprehended the abductor, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Police said they had no information on the girl's father, who neighbors said did not live with the family.

 FOREIGN DEBT _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes foreign creditors about $ 102 billion; about one-third of that is owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> paid out about $ 13 billion in interest and principal to service the debt this year, money that is needed to revive economic growth and quiet demands for a better standard of living. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> hopes to negotiate reduced payments and expects a sympathetic ear from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

It was proposed after a series of pit bull attacks on people, including a 2-year-old hospitalized for about two weeks after suffering neck, back and chest bites. Young has 30 days to act on the measure.

 Help has come nun-too-soon for the sisters at a small, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> women's college stuck with 94,000 cookbooks and a printer's bill for $ 400,000 from a fund-raising project that went awry. `` I call it ` felix culpa.'

Since the sisters' plight was reported in mid-November, Sister <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> said she has received hundreds of mail orders daily for the 350-recipe book, `` In Good Taste.'' `` If it keeps up, we could sell all the cookbooks,'' she said. `` We really do believe in miracles.'' Although too swamped to take an exact tally, she said more than 5,000 orders already have been filled and some companies have approached the sisters about distributing the book. One man sent a check for $ 500 for 25 books. `` He said that he had been educated by one of the sisters that is now working at the college,'' Sister <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> said. The Sisters of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who run the 750-student college, had hoped to raise $ 1 million for scholarships through sales of the cookbook at $ 10 a copy.

<HEAD>Researcher Recommends Hats and Sunglasses To Prevent Cataracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who wear hats and sunglasses to protect their eyes from strong sunshine could substantially reduce the risk of cataracts, says the author of a study published today. The research, conducted on fishermen, found that frequent exposure to intense sun tripled the risk of a common form of cataracts, strengthening the widely held suspicion that too much sun is bad for the eyes, just as it is for the skin. `` If there is enough sunshine for you to get sunburned, then you should be protecting your eyes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that many people have gotten used to smearing sunblock on their faces to prevent skin cancer. But they leave their eyes exposed to damaging ultraviolet light, the invisible portion of the sunbeam that burns the skin and slowly clouds the lens of the eyes. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the easiest way to protect the eyes is to put on a hat with a brim. `` That will cut UV exposure to the eye by 50 percent. And if you get sunglasses, you can eliminate all ocular UV exposure or cut it down by 80 percent to 90 percent,'' he said in an interview. Cataracts are a common health problem, resulting in more than 1 million operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and colleagues estimated the annual ultraviolet exposures of 838 <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> watermen, who work on boats. These varied, depending on how much they fished, the time of year they were on the water and whether they wore hats and glasses, among other factors. Doctors found no association between sunlight and cataracts of the nucleus of the lens. However, they found that it was strongly associated with cataracts of the surrounding cortex of the lens. Cortical and nuclear cataracts each account for about one-third of all cases that require surgery. Not enough fishermen in the study had a third variety of eye damage, known as posterior subcapsular cataracts, to determine whether they also are caused by sunlight. The study, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, found that the higher the men's exposure to ultraviolet light, the greater their risk of cortical cataracts. The researchers divided the watermen into four groups, depending on the intensity of their exposure. The quarter with the highest annual exposure had three times the risk of those in the group with the lowest exposure. The research showed that people who got cortical cataracts received, on average, 21 percent more ultraviolet light than those who did not. Doubling the annual ultraviolet exposure increased the cataract risk by 60 percent. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> wrote that prevention of light damage to the eye `` is the best and simplest approach to the problem.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that all glasses, including ordinary reading glasses, cut exposure significantly, although they vary in effectiveness. The best are plastic lenses specifically designed to block ultraviolet rays. These can stop virtually all of these rays from reaching the eyes. He said that ordinary, untinted glass spectacles stop about 80 percent of ultraviolet radiation, while similar plastic lenses keep out 90 percent. Run-of-the-mill cheap sunglasses block about 95 percent.

 A student who was dismissed from the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> dental school for treating patients after testing positive for exposure to the AIDS virus has sued the school for $ 3 million in damages. The student, whose name is listed in the suit as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, claims the school improperly barred him from its dental program last summer. Attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> contends his client is handicapped and can not be discriminated against. The suit, filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, also names <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensinger </PERSON>, dean of the dental school. The suit does not seek to have the student reinstated, but asks for $ 3 million in damages, contending the use of rubber gloves and other protective devices makes the risk of transmitting the virus negligible. School officials said the student treated 27 patients at the dental school for about a year after contracting the disease. <PERSON> Bensinger </PERSON> said the student tested positive for antibodies to the human immunodefiency syndrome _ HIV _ in late March or early April. The student was dismissed from the school in August and was not allowed to enroll for the current school year. Students and instructional faculty members provide dental care at the school's clinic. University officials refused to comment on the suit. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruger </PERSON>, the university's general counsel, said that the dental school was well within its rights in barring the student from treating patients and pursuing his education.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says constitutional and electoral reforms are `` a kind of oxygen'' to revive the body politic, but it is unlikely they alone can make his society any more democratic. Since the proposed reforms appeared on Oct. 22-23, Soviet society has been engaged in a remarkable debate over an overhaul of the electoral system and the structure of the government that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says is the first big step toward making Soviet society into one governed by law rather than dictate. The 1,500 members of the Supreme Soviet parliament today overwhelmingly approved the package, the amended version of which still has not been published in the official press. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promise is a weighty one in a society now reopening the emotional and physical scars of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges and still suffering from a much more recent history of systematic jailing or exile of dissidents and overbearing bureaucracy. But political reforms do not guarantee change. Political repression has been imposed in a Soviet system that on paper guaranteed citizens' rights. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has shown no interest in sharing power. And operating in the current system, critics have used <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness, to force some changes in his proposals. `` Political reform is a kind of oxygen needed by the public organism,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday, the first day of a special session to consider the reform package. `` If we do not carry out political reform to back up the processes that are now under way in the economy, the social transformation of society and the recuperation in the cultural field, and fail to radically update the activities of the governing councils and our personnel, the drive for restructuring will inevitably begin to skid,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his solution is `` our own socialist system of ` checks and balances' ... designed to protect society against any violations of socialist legality at the highest state level.'' He called for the formation of a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a new 2,250-member legislative body formed not only in elections from geographic districts and ethnic territories, but from organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions. Draft legislation gave the presidency, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed Oct. 1, considerably more power, and appeared as well to strengthen <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s hand with the 15 republics that make up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The proposals loosened an avalanche of more than 300,000 suggestions from across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and protests from at least a third of the republics that some of the reforms fostered the opposite of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proclaimed intention to give local authorities more power. In the spirit of `` glasnost,'' Soviet leaders got an earful of criticism that led them to amend about half of the almost 120 articles before introducing them to the Supreme Soviet on Monday. In two days of rare debate, deputies of the Supreme Soviet offered many more. `` The discussion itself, I'll tell you frankly, is unprecedented,'' Soviet Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> told a news conference. The tiny Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness already encouraged a grassroots political movement to demand greater autonomy, has declared itself `` sovereign'' in internal affairs and proclaiming the right to pass judgment on new Soviet laws. Similar organizations in the other Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> were close behind but could not push the legislation through their parliaments. The Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet declared <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s action unconstitutional <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also must rein in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government bureaucracies that are stubbornly resistant to change. The president told the Supreme Soviet that many initiatives from working people `` are being lost in bureaucratic mazes, or are even encountering resistance.'' He won approval at the June party conference for a plan to get the party out of day-to-day management of government and economic affairs, concentrating instead on setting policy. He has called for taking power from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and giving it to local economic managers along with the responsibility of ensuring they make enough money to pay for their operations. But the Soviet leader regularly expresses frustration with both the party and government bureaucracy's slow pace of change.

 A rotten holiday season awaits anyone who steals an evergreen tree planted at parks in <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>. Workers this week will begin spraying evergreens throughout the park system with a chemical retardant that puts off an odor similar to rotten eggs when exposed to temperatures above 50 degrees.

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in lover rehearsed her prosecution testimony, anticipating the most dramatic confrontation in his trial on charges he beat his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter to death. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who has not faced <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in more than a year, was expected to testify today that he beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to death. `` That confrontation will be electrifying,'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillers </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` That experience could free her. Telling her story could be cleansing.'' `` She is the key, crucial witness,'' state judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said during pretrial hearings. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, spent about 10 minutes Wednesday with a detective, prosecutors and her lawyers in the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> courtroom where the trial is being held and spent eight hours with prosecutors outside the courtroom, according to several reports. There were no proceedings in the case Wednesday. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has denied he hit <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. He says she fell unconscious after choking on food the night of Nov. 1, 1987, and that he caused the bruises on her chest and back while trying futilely to revive her. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, described as a bright, outgoing first-grader, was removed bruised, unconscious and barely breathing early the next morning from the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> shared. The girl was pronounced dead at a hospital three days later. Police also found a 16-month-old boy the couple raised in the apartment. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attorneys have suggested during the trial that <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> struck the blow that killed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. `` She's nervous,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>, said Wednesday. In the weeks following <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s arrest last year, `` <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> felt protective about <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> said. `` Despite the almost total destruction of her personality by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, her feelings have changed,'' he continued. `` She's come to have a lot greater insight into her relationship with <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has spent the past year recovering from the psychological and physical injuries which <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> blamed on <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. She has had several operations, faces more, and has been living at a nursing facility. In a $ 3.6 million lawsuit filed against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> this week, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> charged he beat her, brainwashed her, plied her with drugs and made her beg for food. She said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> forced her to take ice water baths if he caught her eating without permission. The jury hearing the murder trial saw a police videotape showing serious wounds and bruises over <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s body which <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> says were inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is a disbarred lawyer who illegally obtained <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> at birth from a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teen-ager. The child's natural mother, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, now 27, watches the trial daily from a front row seat.

<HEAD>Justice Training Council Approves Police Cadet Training Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEEDHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state council on police training approved reforms, including minimum physical fitness standards for cadets and certification for instructors, in the wake of a 25-year-old cadet's death. The <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly for the new measures in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb Wednesday as a coroner's inquest into the death of Cadet <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> continued in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> The council reiterated its abolition of `` modified stress training,'' which combined constant exercise with unexpected situations and conflicting orders. Such methods were partly blamed for the dehydration suffered by cadets at the <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> training academy near <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed on the first day of training Sept. 19 at the academy after a day of rigorous training with few breaks for water. He died six weeks later of complications from heat stroke, a coroner has ruled. Fifteen other cadets were hospitalized the first week of training. The measures approved Wednesday are part of a 120-day `` action plan'' which will go into effect with the start of new training classes in January, according to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the council's interim executive director The plan is intended to become part of a permanent, comprehensive program for teaching police recruits. `` We will have made a clean break with the past,'' <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> told council members and a panel that included Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. `` We will set the agenda for the future by laying the groundwork now.'' Among other rules adopted Wednesday: _ Injuries to student officers must be documented and recorded; _ Physical or academic punishment to teach, enforce or maintain discipline is prohibited; _ Establishment of a new discipline policy, including a merit-demerit system; _ Pre-admission drug screening and physicals by qualified physicians; _ More rigorous rules for academic performance, including standardization of all written tests; _ Creation of new qualifications and certification for all academy directors and instructors; _ All academy directors and instructors must read the attorney general's report of what happened during training this year; _ Pre-admission orientation on physical and academic aspects of police training. The council also accepted the resignation of Assistant Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> and authorized the dismissals of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Crossen </PERSON>, director of training; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelman </PERSON>, pre-screening coordinator and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, former zone manager for western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, director of standards, will be reassigned to new duties, the council said.

 A bandit was `` remorseful, crying and upset'' that he stole an Impressionist painting worth more than $ 1 million from a museum, but not sorry enough to turn himself in, police said. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said the tearful thief called police Wednesday morning to tell them <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manet </PERSON>'s `` Bouquet of Peonies,'' taken Sunday from the Heckscher Museum in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, could be found at an apartment complex in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> The thief told police the painting could be found in the basement laundry room, but it was not there when police arrived shortly before noon, according to <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Commissioner <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guido </PERSON>. The building's superintendent had found it, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> said, and put it in a storage room. The superintendent had thought about hanging it in his apartment but decided against it because he did n't think it was attractive. <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> said the superintendent was `` quite shocked'' to learn the value of the painting. <PERSON> Heckscher </PERSON> museum Registrar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said the recovered painting was authentic and undamaged. The painting, in its gold frame, measures about 16 -LCB- by 21 -LCB- inches and could have been smuggled out of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> museum under a coat, said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>. Police said the thief apparently took the painting from the wall, walked out a basement door and escaped. Two uniformed guards were patrolling the five-room exhibition area at the time. Investigators are trying to uncover the identity of a blond man who witnesses said they saw putting a painting into the trunk of a silver car outside the museum, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> said. But he said police will not use laser equipment to try to retrieve fingerprints from the painting because it would be a `` cultural felony'' to risk damaging the work. <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> said it was `` clearly a miracle that we have recovered the painting. It is amazing we got it back.'' The 1880 <PERSON> Manet </PERSON> is a still life of red and pink flowers in a glass vase. It had been lent to the Heckscher by its owner, who has remained anonymous. The full value of the painting was not made public, but police and museum officials said it was more than $ 1 million.

It's a common thing, and he did n't know it was an infraction.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> Police Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGrand </PERSON> said misdemeanors like the one for which <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> was cited are not unusual on football Saturdays.

<HEAD>Jackson Sees `Qualitative Change' Between Bush And Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who once said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was morally unfit to be president, said today he expects a `` qualitative change'' on civil rights when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes over from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated to him during a White House meeting Wednesday that he would strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, engage in a comprehensive anti-drug battle and be more open to advice on social issues. `` I suppose just having lines of communications open is a step towards being kinder and gentler,'' the former Democratic presidential candidate said, referring to a pledge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made when he accepted the Republican nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been `` unkind and harsh'' in some of his actions. Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> closed the door against the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and others concerned about civil rights and added, `` I think there will be a qualitative change'' under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` awfully mum'' during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years but added, `` I suppose there's a certain presidential loyalty that goes along with being vice president.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had been encouraged by past meetings with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over Haitian refugees, the extension of voters' rights and the condition of blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I'm concerned that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will now put forth the initiative to set a new moral tone for our country,'' he said. `` No one can set a moral tone better than the president can.'' He described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` quite positive and quite upbeat'' during their 90-minute discussion. `` I am ... persuaded that his commitment to have a credible <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is going to make some difference in race relations in this country,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was also encouraged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness to meet with hard-pressed farmers. `` That kind of openness and access and willingness to expand and to hear other people certainly is the highest and most effective use of the pulpit called the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not indicate whom he would pick to lead the war on drugs, but he said both men agreed it must be someone who has the complete confidence of the president and the secretary of state. He said an anti-drug war that focuses only on children _ an apparent reference to first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' efforts _ was not enough, with $ 150 billion being spent on drugs. `` Children are not buying that amount,'' he said. `` My impression is he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- really wants to fight a comprehensive drug war, and I'm willing to help in any way I can.''

 The AIDS virus disappeared from the bloodstreams of 10 patients with AIDS or a related disease when they got monthly transfusions of blood plasma from otherwise healthy carriers of the virus, researchers said today. The researchers said the treatment apparently kills the virus without causing serious side effects. `` It does n't mean that they do n't have any more virus in their bodies,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Molecular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is no more free virus in the blood to infect their cells.'' The plasma, treated to remove viruses, contains high levels of antibodies that can kill the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said. AIDS patients lack such antibodies in their blood, said <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON>, who led the research team. Research details appear in December's issue of The Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific journal, he said <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> called the results of his study `` very encouraging,'' but other AIDS researchers urged caution in interpreting them. Dr <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazzard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stephen </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the tests were conducted, said the findings were interesting but that larger trials must be done before anyone could say the treatment offered any clinical benefit. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s Global Program on AIDS, said, `` If it's for real, -LRB- it -RRB- deserves to be further evaluated.'' However, `` I think that there may be a lot of work between some experimental results like that and what kind of applicability you would have in the real world,'' he warned in an interview. `` We do n't know how effective it would be, how long people would have to take such a product. It could very well be for life. So a lot of things have to be worked out before we can really offer people a real ray of hope,'' he said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune system, breaking down its resistance to infection. No cure has been discovered. Not everyone infected with the AIDS virus goes on to develop symptoms. In trials over the past nine months on six AIDS patients and four suffering from an early stage of AIDS known as AIDS-related complex, the virus in the patients' blood `` immediately disappeared ... following the transfusion of this hyper-immune plasma,'' <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said in an interview. The researchers said nine of the 10 patients are still alive, reasonably well, and out of hospital nine months later. `` Those patients have remained virus negative now for nine months,'' <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said some of patients in the study with early symptoms of AIDS began producing their own antibodies when injected with the antibody-rich plasma. `` The explanation could be that the neutralizing antibody stopped the virus infecting more T-cells,'' he said. T-cells, which are destroyed by the AIDS virus, are a type of blood cell essential to the body's immune defenses. <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said he believes the method could reverse the course of AIDS in some patients, or `` at least to keep it at bay.'' He hopes to conduct further tests, comparing the effectiveness of his treatment with the drug azidothymidine, or AZT, which has been shown to prolong the lives of AIDS sufferers. AZT's drawback is that it is toxic to bone marrow, and causes anemia. But the experimental method, said <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON>, `` is not a drug. It has no toxic effect whatsoever. It's human plasma. It's like a transfusion.'' <PERSON> Karpas </PERSON> said larger-scale tests need to be done, but he said he saw no reason why the treatment could n't be made available immediately.

<TEXT>
 Co-speakers, co-chairmen, cooperation. That's the plan for the restructured <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, its leaders say The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, elected co-speakers for the first time Wednesday and adopted a special agreement that redistributes many of the speaker's powers to the chamber's members. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON> were named co-speakers by unanimous voice votes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which went from a 52-48 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> majority to an even split after the Democrats picked up two seats in the Nov. 8 election. The two men, who negotiated the power-sharing agreement over 2 -LCB- days last week, jointly clutched the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gavel and raised it aloft as the membership stood cheering and applauding. `` This is a historic occasion, one in which we all can take a great deal of pride,'' said <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON>, who presided alone as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker the last two years. The two men will preside over the chamber on alternate days. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> went first, wielding the gavel after the speaker election. <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON> will get his turn when the House reconvenes Jan. 4. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader for the last 12 years, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> quoted poet <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> in a speech urging `` conciliation, not confrontation'' during the 1989 session. `` We're taking the road less traveled by, and that will make all the difference,'' he said. `` I'm convinced the system will work.'' The co-speaker arrangement and a series of rules changes were negotiated after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tried unsuccessfully last week to elect a speaker. Under the agreement, each committee will have <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> co-chairmen and equal membership from each party. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> speaker will appoint committee members from his party and assign Republican-authored bills to committee. The Democratic speaker will do the same for his party. If a co-chairman does not want to hold a hearing on a bill, his counterpart from the other party can draw on his allotment of `` wild cards'' to keep the bill moving. A tie vote in a committee will send a bill to the floor without recommendation. Previously, a bill died if it did not win a majority vote in committee. Once a bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, the author can control when it is called down for amendment and a final vote. Formerly, the speaker controlled the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar of bills and exercised his greatest power by killing bills through refusing to call them for votes.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> arrived today for the first foreign-ministry level talks between the two communist powers on Soviet soil in 31 years. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as two great neighboring countries, must live in peace and good-neighborly relations,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said in a statement distributed by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are glad that in recent years Chinese-Soviet relations gradually are improving. I sincerely hope this visit will end with the expecte results.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> was greeted at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sheremetyevo </ORGANIZATION> 2 airport by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, with whom he will conduct two days of talks that will include laying the groundwork for a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting next year. The Chinese foreign minister also said he expects to meet with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Before leaving <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said the focus of his talks will be the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the major stumbling block to restoring normal Chinese-Soviet ties. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the main backer of anti-Vietnamese resistance forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, insists that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> exert pressure on its ally <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to end its 10-year military occupation of that <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country. The last Chinese foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> in 1957. No Soviet foreign minister has made an official visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> accompanied then Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in 1959. In 1960, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> split after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> of `` revisionism'' and compromising with the capitalist West. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> responded by withdrawing Soviet engineers and technology from hundreds of joint projects, dealing a painful blow to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fragile industrial base. Relations reached a low in 1969 when the two sides fought a short war along their disputed border. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> called on the nation to prepare for all-out war, and each side stationed at least 1 million troops along the border. The countries began normalization talks in 1982, opening the way for a general easing of tensions and a gradual increase in trade, scientific and cultural exchanges. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> noted that the two sides held vice foreign minister-level talks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last August on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and that he had discussed the issue with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in September. Both sides, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, `` have indicated their willingness to make an effort to bring about an early settlement to the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- question on a just and reasonable basis, including the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> troop withdrawal.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> also indicated that the first Chinese-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959 was a certainty, regardless of further progress on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. That summit is scheduled next year in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Asked if the summit was linked to solving the Cambodian question, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, `` Now the conditions for the summit meeting in the view of both sides are getting ready and both sides are making preparations for his summit.'' He said his visit and a return visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, probably next month, by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` will all be part of the preparations.'' Chinese leaders have said a summit could take place in the first half of 1989. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to come to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, rarely travels abroad. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has continued to insist `` three obstacles'' remain, headed by <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, that must be solved before full normalization can be realized. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and reducing tension along the border by withdrawing one army division facing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from Soviet ally <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said he will discuss the estimated 50,000 Soviet troops still in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, `` which should be pulled out,'' border disputes and `` the Soviet military gathering along the Chinese-Soviet border.''

<HEAD>Woman Allegedly Made Her Own Death Threats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who spoke out in favor of housing desegregation in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> has been charged with fabricating a death threat after being videotaped vandalizing her own home. A complaint filed Wednesday in federal court said a camera concealed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> taped <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Recht </PERSON>, 35, writing a racist, anti-Semitic death threat on her house Saturday. The complaint also charges that Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> reported receiving death threats by telephone Aug. 16, although a police tracing device failed to pick them up. Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> was the only speaker among 50 people at a <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting last January who supported a court-ordered desegregation plan, and she received extensive media attention. She later claimed she had received hundreds of death threats and that swastikas and racist remarks had been written on the outside walls of her apartment. After two incidents were reported, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> installed a camera outside her apartment. A former legal secretary and a law student at an undisclosed school, Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> was charged with a single count of filing a false statement, a felony which carries up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine upon conviction. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> arraigned Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> and released her on her own recognizance, pending a Dec. 30 court appearance. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she had no objection to Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> being released because Ms. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> had lived in the area all her life, lived in the apartment for eight years and had no previous criminal record. The Yonkers desegregation case stemmed from a 1985 ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leonard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sand </ORGANIZATION> in which the city was found liable for 40 years of segregated housing and schools.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today blocked the executions of two Sikhs condemned to death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The decision came 14 hours before the two men were to hang. A panel of three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices granted the request for a stay of execution filed by the son of <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, one of the condemned men. The stay will remain in effect until Tuesday to give the court time to hear an appeal challenging the president's denial of clemency. Lawyers for <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, one of the two guards who shot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, convicted of conspiracy, filed a variety of petitions with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. They sought to block the hangings scheduled for Friday morning, but those petitions were rejected. President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> last week turned down an appeal for clemency by <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Home Ministry official disclosed Wedesday. The reason for the denial was not disclosed. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 30, can not be hanged while that petition was pending for <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 54. The two men are not related, but like all members of Sikh faith they use the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and another Sikh bodyguard, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, shot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in the garden of her residence on Oct. 31, 1984. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in apparent retaliation for an army raid she ordered four months earlier to rout militants from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than 1,200 people died, most of them Sikhs. Her murder triggered anti-Sikh riots across northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by members of the majority Hindu religion. More than 2,700 people died, nearly all of them Sikhs. Sikh violence since then has escalated, with more than 2,300 people killed this year alone in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Tihar prison, where the two are being held, was under heavy guard today, with dozens of extra security guards armed with rifles and yardlong bamboo canes. Sentries watched from sand-bagged bunkers outside the salmon-colored prison walls. The watchtowers atop the walls also were sandbagged. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, heavily armed security forces manned checkpoints along the roads and officials ordered schools and universities closed as a precaution.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to send two former officials to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to testify on charges the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aided the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising, officials said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministery </ORGANIZATION> said the request was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 24 to have former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> appear before a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to cooperate with the investigation, but he could not comment further until the request was evaluated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. About 200 people were killed in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> when South Korean soldiers put down an uprising by students and citizens. The assembly is investigating the incident as part of a probe into abuses under the authoritarian rule of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Some opposition leaders claim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising because most South Korean forces are under the command of the local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander. They contend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> command gave South Korean generals permission to move units to suppress the uprising. Lawmakers say they want to determine if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> played any role in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> or condoned the action by not trying to block deployment of South Korean forces under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> command. American officials have said that South Korean commanders moved troops independently and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders were not consulted. The assembly wants to question <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> _ the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1980. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general who took power with military backing after the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident, went into internal exile last week after apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule. Special parliamentary committees are investigating the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident, corruption and human rights abuses. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> were senior generals in command of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military during the 1980 uprising. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took office in February after winning December 1987 presidential elections. <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> commanded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact and also was chief of the Combined Forces Command that oversees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Korean forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact against communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is planning a major shuffle of the government to remove officials linked to the Chun government. He has promised to release political prisoners as part of a plan to try and defuse the nationwide furor over <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. Opposition parties are demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> appear before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> probe. The former president has denied any personal wrongdoing, but some relatives and aides have been convicted or charged with corruption. The <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> decided today to accept a plan to remove the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> from any domestic political role. The agency, once known as the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, has been used to suppress domestic opposition in the past. The Cabinet said it would accept the recommendations of an advisory group studying ways to reform the agency, except for a proposal to subject the agency to government auditing and parliamentary oversight. Opposition parties want the intelligence agency's budget made public and parliamentary power to inquire into its activities.

<TEXT>
 Christmas furloughs for a triple murderer and other inmates of a maximum security prison may be revoked because of public outcry, while police sought an escapee from the same prison in the rape of a 40-year-old woman. While the <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> review board ponders the furloughs and may decide the matter today, a warrant has been issued for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavarakas </PERSON>, the prime suspect in a rape of a 40-year-old woman in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb of <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>. The attack bears a startling resemblance to the crime that landed Stavarakas in prison in 1979, authorities said. He escaped Monday from the prison in <LOCATION> Jessup </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, where he was serving a 25-year sentence. The victim's general description of the attacker matched that of <LOCATION> Stavarakas </LOCATION>, and she noted distinctive tattoos, said <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. In addition, the rape occurred near the same park as Stavarakas' 1978 assault. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge on Wednesday issued a temporary injunction blocking Patuxent officials from granting additional furloughs to triple murderer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> for at least 10 days. The order was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has filed suit to force <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>'s transfer to another prison. <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, 31, was sentenced to three life terms for the murders of two <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officers and a teen-ager. Judge <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Sybert </PERSON> said the injunction would expire at midnight Dec. 9. A police association attorney said he would apply then for a 10-day extension of the order. Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokesman for the police association, said he was pleased with <PERSON> Sybert </PERSON>'s ruling. `` I do n't think we can afford the luxury of gambling on <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>,'' he said. `` He forfeited his right to freedom when he murdered three people.'' The association filed the suit after reports that <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> had been granted 11 furloughs to visit his family since April. The corrections department put an end to the visits in the ensuing furor and canceled <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>'s planned Thanksgiving leave. Patuxent is the only institution in the country which has independent powers to grant paroles and supervised furloughs, a power some state officials want to review because of the outcry caused by the <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> case.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and one of the longest living AIDS victims sent messages to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> today on the first World AIDS Day. The messages called for a stepped-up fight against AIDS and for compassion for its victims. The agency organized World AIDS Day to encourage governments and communities to talk about the disease, which affects an estimated 300,000 people worldwide. It said 140 countries planned special television and radio programs and dances, parades and song contests. Entertainer Pearl <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> told officials at <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters that she knows a 29-year-old man with AIDS and that she wants to dedicate her life to the fight against the disease. Also present was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, a 32-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> man who has had AIDS for six years. <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> said World AIDS Day should be `` the opening paragraph in a new chapter of our worldwide effort to stop AIDS.'' <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, currently based in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said he has traveled to three continents to teach people about AIDS. Officially, 142 countries have reported 129,385 cases of AIDS to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But the agency estimates that the true number is more than twice that, and that 5 to 10 million people may be infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Once a person is infected with the virus, he or she has a 50 percent chance of developing AIDS within 10 years. There is no known cure for AIDS, which attacks the body's immune system. The agency has emphasized education as a primary means to fight the spread of the infection, which can be transmitted through blood, sexual intercourse, and from an infected mother to her unborn or newborn child. People at high risk of infection include those with numerous sex partners and intravenous drug users who share needles. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, told the opening ceremony that the `` spread of infection in some high risk groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is clearly declining.'' He said this was because `` some infected and non-infected individuals practicing risky behavior have adopted safe or less risky lifestyles.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> noted that the first cases of AIDS were recognized in 1981, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that 78,985 Americans have gotten AIDS and 44,334 have died from it. But he also said: `` AIDS has stimulated an unprecedented scientific and medical research effort that will have long-term benefit in combating AIDS and other diseases as well.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called knowledge `` a critical weapon'' in fighting AIDS, and said knowledge must also lead to individual responsibility. `` It is the responsibility of each individual to learn about HIV and to treat those infected with HIV with respect and compassion. And it is the responsibility of infected individuals not to infect others,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a message read by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. The pope's statement urged `` respect for all individuals'' and said `` the degree of civilization of societies may be judged by how civilization responds to the suffering of man.'' He said AIDS victims `` meet with my affection and are the subject of my prayers.''

 <PERSON> Basharat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON>, an illegal alien from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, woke up well before dawn on the final day of an opportunity to keep his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream alive. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday and drove about 100 miles to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office here. The 30-year-old <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON>, one of more than 1 million alien farm workers to apply for a work permit under a nationwide amnesty program that expired at midnight, said he chose the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> office because <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office was crowded with other applicants. `` Too much rush there. Too much people there,'' <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said. `` Not so many peoples here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> initially estimated that 600,000 farm workers would pay the $ 185 fee to apply under the sweeping program mandated by the 1986 immigration act. But by the deadline, 1.1 million to 1.2 million applications were taken, the agency said. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON>, who heads the amnesty program for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said today that the agency did not turn away any applicants who were waiting in line at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices at midnight. He said the agency believed many of those applying were not farm workers, but other aliens who missed a May 4 deadline for non-farm workers to apply for amnesty. `` I think it's because the standards of proof were so lenient that many aliens, feeling increasingly desperate because of employer sanctions -LRB- against hiring illegal aliens -RRB-, took advantage of that -LRB- farm program -RRB- to get legal status,'' <PERSON> Bodin </PERSON> said on `` This Morning'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` We really do n't know how many people are truly eligible,'' he said. Those aliens whose applications are rejected `` are back where they were and the service takes no action. It's expected, however, because of the employer sanctions provisions making it illegal for employers to hire illegal aliens, these people will eventually be discouraged and return home of their own volition.'' Illegal aliens like <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> came from as far away as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, chief legalization officer in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 20 miles northeast of here. In the weeks before the deadline, some applicants traveled by taxi from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. One arrived in a Mercedes equipped with a car phone. `` I did n't know there was so much money in farm work,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> joked. Under the first phase of the immigrant legalization program that ended May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7 million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982. Under agricultural phase, illegal aliens had to prove they harvested perishable crops for at least 90 days between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986. Those accepted will receive temporary residency status and eventually will be able to apply for permanent status. Effective today, agricultural employers now face fines up to $ 10,000 per illegal alien for hiring undocumented workers. Many applicants provided false documentation that cost them up to $ 3,000 in a desperate attempt to gain legal status, immigration officials across the country said. Ten applicants were arrested Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> when they produced fake documents, and four others were arrested in connection with an organization that supplied illegal aliens with phony papers, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In Liberal, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, five people were arrested late Tuesday and early Wednesday for selling fraudulent employment letters to illegal aliens. More than half the applications under the program, or about 500,000, have come from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with about 10 percent and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with about 8 percent, officials said. Significant numbers were filed in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> office, applicants from around the globe sat for hours, clutching paperwork and awaiting a chance to see an INS officer. Many spoke in their native tongues. One man wore a turban, others sported cowboy or baseball hats. By 7:30 p.m., about 125 people had met with <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officers, with 100 more to go before midnight and beyond, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` We'll take anyone in line at midnight,'' he said. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said he qualified for amnesty by picking grapes and cherries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Since -LRB- I was a -RRB- child, I have dream to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Here, good money,'' he said. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984 via <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION> and an illegal boat landing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hardev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 45-year-old man from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said through an interpreter that he paid $ 600 to hide in the back of a truck from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to escape political strife and unemployment. For <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagomez </PERSON>, a 36-year-old mushroom worker in nearby <LOCATION> Kennett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, winning residency status and thus keeping his job was a matter of life and death for his impoverished wife and four children back in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Villagomez </PERSON>, who speaks only Spanish, said he sends some of the money he makes to his family. `` If I do n't they'll die of hunger,'' he said.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintains that `` all is tranquil'' among his campaign staff despite reports of warring opinions on whether to name former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as secretary of defense. `` We're not going to do everything in a great rush. We're trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to back up appointments at all levels,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today. `` Any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to somebody it concerns me no matter who it is. Senator Tower's a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while to go forward.'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told reporters `` Stay tuned,'' when asked about Tower, who still is considered the likely choice for the top Pentagon job. Asked then if there were indeed a raging battle in his staff over the prudence of naming Tower, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed. `` No. All is tranquil. There's a thousand and one points of light out there,'' he said in a play on an obtuse quotation he used often in his campaign to describe the many facets of society. Denying any delay in filling that job, he said, `` I'm going to stay on my schedule, make these decisions in my own time, thorough decisions.'' Sources close to the transition say part of the delay in the decision on Tower results from an attempt to find a complementary person to fill the No. 2 Pentagon spot. Among others mentioned for <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary are <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON> of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>.

 Police today sought criminal charges against employees of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> after a three-year investigation into the cause of the world's worst single-plane crash. Police said the crash, in which 520 people died, was caused by the professional negligence of 20 people, including four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees, 12 <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> workers and four employees of the ministry of transport. The people accused of negligence were responsible for aircraft repairs, maintenance and inspection. It was the first time that criminal charges arising from a plane crash investigation have been sought against officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for aviation safety. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer, said in a statement it believed the accident did not involve a criminal act. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> does not believe that criminal acts were committed by anyone and hopes that the district prosecutor's office also will conclude that there was no criminal conduct,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Gunma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> handed results of the probe to the <ORGANIZATION> Maebashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which will decide whether to press charges for negligence, which is an offense under Japanese criminal law. The police said they were unable to question the four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees. But they said documents confiscated from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> provided enough evidence to substantiate their involvement. The four reportedly supervised a repair of the aircraft in 1978 that was performed improperly. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> sources said that police already have names of people who performed the repairs, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees have rejected repeated police requests for questioning. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 with 524 people aboard crashed into a mountain during a flight from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> on Aug. 12, 1985, killing all but four on board. The police action highlights the different legal customs regarding air accidents and corporate criminal liability in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is one of a few countries where criminal charges are sought against individuals responsible for airplane accidents, said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>, criminal law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, individuals involved in an airplane accident are usually granted criminal immunity in exchange for cooperating in investigations into the cause of an accident, <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON> said. `` The most important thing in an accident like this is to pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute individuals,'' he said. `` But unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under Japanese criminal law corporations can not be charged for wrongdoing. `` In order to disclose causes of accidents, police have to seek criminal charges against individuals,'' he said. <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamachi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, said his company would take the matter seriously and continue its efforts to prevent the recurrence of such an tragic accident. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> rejected Japanese allegations that the company had hindered the investigation, saying that it had cooperated with Japanese authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> sources said the company planned to respond to the police inquiry, but was unlikely to allow <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> police to question individual employees. The airplane maker has disclosed that repairs it performed on the rear bulkhead, the metal partition that protects the pressurized cabin, of the aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 were faulty. The aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978 at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, damaging its tail section, and underwent major repairs, according to <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>. A government report issued in 1987 concluded that improper repairs had accelerated metal fatigue, which caused the bulkhead to burst, blowing off part of the plane's tail fin and sending the jumbo jet out of control. The report accused the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> personnel of faulty repairs and inadequate inspection. Police said the accident could have been avoided if <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had performed the repairs properly, if <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had checked the repairs adequately, and if the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had inspected the aircraft properly. A group of relatives of passengers who died in the crash have presented signatures of 34,120 people to the <ORGANIZATION> Trasnport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> requesting a criminal prosecution against <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> said about 70 percent of compensation negotiations have been settled. The company and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to share the cost of compensation to the victims' families and the four survivors of the crash, according to <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>.

 A Holocaust survivor threw acid in the face of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> during a funeral today for another <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lawyer who died in an apparent suicide. The attack on attorney <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> injured one of his eyes, police and a hospital spokesman said. A woman standing nearby suffered a minor eye injury from the splashed acid, police said. Police said they detained the assailant, a 70-year-old survivor of the Nazi Holocaust, immediately after the attack, which occurred at the <LOCATION> Sanhedria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> during the funeral for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>.

The Itim news agency quoted an unidentified witness as saying the assailant told <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> died because of you.'' The man then took a bottle out of his pocket and threw the acid. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> was rushed to <LOCATION> Bikur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where doctors washed the eye.

Police said the death was a suicide. The death has delayed <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s appeal of a death sentence to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for six months. The appeal had been scheduled to begin Dec. 5. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a 68-year-old retired autoworker from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was sentenced in April for committing crimes against humanity and the Jewish people as an operator of gas chambers at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews perished during World War II. <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> was sent for further treatment to a special eye unit at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, Kingslinger and officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> said.

He said the body found Tuesday `` may be No. 5, not No. 4. There may be another person out there is my concern, if not more.'' Three of the bodies were discovered along Interstate 195 in this southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town. The fourth was found along a state road in nearby <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>. Two of the bodies were discovered in July, the other two in November. All four women were believed to have been nude when killed, investigators said. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said it was possible that the four deaths were connected with the deaths of two women from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, whose bodies were found last spring off highways in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. None of the four more recently found bodies has been identified. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said one person may have killed the three women whose bodies were found here, and that the person was familiar with the area. `` The fact that they're all in the same area would lead you to believe that a person has done more than one killing,'' he said. `` There's no doubt that those people were all murdered and left there.'' State Trooper <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said the bodies were left in similar locations within 15 feet of the tree lines off the highways. But, he said, there also were dissimilarities in the cases. Four women have been listed as missing from nearby <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> in the last several months, but no definite link between them and the bodies has been made.

 A man trapped in the Never Summer Mountains for five days walked to safety three days after his snowmobiling companion died of an apparent heart attack. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>, 38, stumbled onto a logging road Wednesday morning where he was picked up by a truck driver. He and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 65, had traveled to the snow-whipped mountains 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last Friday on an afternoon snowmobile outing. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> died Sunday, and <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> waited two more days in vain to be rescued before walking out on his own. In recounting the ordeal from a hospital bed in <LOCATION> Granby </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said the men's snowmobiles became mired the day they left in a high-country gulch 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. `` When it became obvious the weather was not going to clear up and they were n't coming after us, I decided to go out the way we came,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. Heavy winds had drifted snow over their tracks, and it took <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> nearly five hours to walk about two miles through snow up to 2 feet deep before he came to the logging road. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>'s face and hands were black from sitting by a campfire in subzero weather. On his way out, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> found snowmobile tracks indicating searchers had not been more than two miles from his campfire. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, the logging truck driver, later led searchers to the spot where he found <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>, and the searchers followed <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>'s tracks back to his camp and recovered <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' body. Freezing winds sent wind-chill factors to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit in the area and blinding white-outs plagued would-be rescuers during the search. They had called off their ground search Tuesday night, after three days of searching. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said when they tried to free their machines Friday afternoon, `` that was when <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> had his first heart attack. He was feeling pretty poorly so we rested.'' Although they had brought along trail mix, cheese, crackers and fruit for their afternoon outing, neither man had any matches. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said they soaked a piece of cardboard in gasoline from a snowmobile, and cranked an engine, using a sparkplug to light the cardboard. `` The first night or two, when <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was still alive, we traded turns taking care of the fire. After he died, I'd build the fire up and the smoke would blow in my face and choke me when it was getting low and I'd wake up again.'' Before he died Sunday, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> wanted to try again to get out. `` He said, ` Let's go real slow,' but we did n't get more than 15 feet from the camp and he decided he was n't going,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> collapsed about noon Sunday and died. After <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' death, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> decided to `` stay where we were at, and wait to be rescued.'' At one point he heard a plane overhead, but the weather was too bad for the pilot to see them, even with a smoky fire. `` I'm tired and I'm thirsty but I feel fine,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said Wednesday night. `` I'm thankful for all the people who looked for us, and I'm sorry to have put them to so much trouble.''

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s selection as prime minister triumphantly ended an 11-year effort to restore her family name and Pakistani democracy. At 35, she also becomes one of the world's youngest heads of government and the first woman prime minister to lead a Moslem nation in modern times. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, inherits the political mantle of her father, the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was ousted by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death in an Aug. 17 plane crash made Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who had pledged to restore democracy, the nation's only nationally recognized political leader. Although a daughter of affluence, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s appeal lies mainly among the poor masses of this country's 107 million people. They are the strength of her left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which captured the most seats in the Nov. 16 National Assembly elections. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> drew massive, adoring crowds during her campaign for the country's first free elections since her father's death. Mindful of Moslem and local custom, she always is clad in traditional clothes with a scarf draped over her head. The poised and articulate leader, who speaks English fluently, shocked her Western friendsby consenting to an arranged marriage last December with <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who has kept her maiden name, was groomed for politics by her doting father as the eldest of his four children. He sent her to study government and politics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> then at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. It was at the British university that she tasted her first political success when she was elected president of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> debating society in 1976. The prime minister's post is Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> first paying job. Her only previous employment began in early 1977 as a non-paid trainee in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It was short-lived, however, as <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> toppled her father's government a few months later on the pretext that elections that year were rigged <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was hanged in 1979 after his conviction for helping plot the murder of a political foe, a charge his family has denied. Despite years of detention and foreign exile during <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON>, kept the party alive as <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s disenfranchised opposition Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party critics claim she has inherited her father's domineering ego but has renounced his socialist ideals Her supporters say that with <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> gone, she is <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s only nationally recognized political leader and a unifying force in the country's volatile ethnic mosaic. Her party commands 105 votes in the 237-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> says she has enough support from independents and minor parties to command a majority. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> espouses prosperity for the poor but has appeased the business community with promises of a market-oriented economy, and the military by pledging to continue <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s staunch backing with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of Moslem anti-communist rebels in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. She started her election campaign in late October, following the Sept. 21 birth of her first child, a son named <PERSON> Bilawal </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> rarely has appeared with her husband in public and has not yet allowed public photographs of their baby.

<HEAD>Authorities Seek Clues In Blast That Killed Six Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ammonium nitrate that exploded during an arson fire and killed six firemen had been mixed with other compounds that made it far more explosive than usual, police say. A reward for information on the arsonists has reached $ 35,000 with an anonymous donor's offer of $ 25,000, and donations are pouring in for the victims' families, city officials said. Firefighters from across the nation and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are expected at a memorial service. Officials initially thought that only ammonium nitrate, considered one of the milder and more stable explosives, had been stored in two trailers that blew up early Tuesday at a highway construction site. But the ammonium nitrate had been mixed with diesel fuel, pink dye and powdered aluminum to form `` <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> mix,'' a blasting agent usually detonated by a small amount of dynamite, police said. The mixture explains why the blasts were powerful enough to kill the firefighters, demolish two firetrucks and create a shock wave that broke windows up to 10 miles away and was heard up to 40 miles away. `` All it requires is a heat source'' to detonate, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said there were no significant developments Wednesday in the arson investigation. Officials announced a $ 35,000 reward for information on suspects in the fire. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON>, wife of Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> who is on a trade mission in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said a donor who wishes to remain anonymous had given $ 25,000 toward the reward fund. An additional $ 5,000 came from the <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and $ 5,000 from the Arson Hotline. Donations also have been pouring into <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where a fund has been established to help the victims' families, bank spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberger </PERSON> said. `` Everyone has been so extremely helpful in trying to donate. All they're concerned about is the families,'' <PERSON> Eichenberger </PERSON> said. He said the total amount of money donated was not available Wednesday. A public memorial service for the six firefighters is scheduled Saturday at <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> and firefighters from almost every state, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, have called to ask about the ceremony. Even a fire department in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said firefighters plan to attend, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON>, a Fire Department spokesman. The six firefighters had been warned by a dispatcher there could be explosives at the scene of a fire that police believe was started by an arsonist, according to transcripts of conversations with dispatchers. But fire officials said the six apparently saw no signs at the site indicating that explosives were stored in the trailers. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday discussed drafting tougher laws regarding the regulation of explosives. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, called for a congressional investigation into the construction site explosion and what he called `` a tragic addition to the growing list of hazardous material accidents.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda today said 28 people have been killed in two weeks ofethnic violence in the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Kremlin leaders issued an urgent appeal for calm. Official reports said thousands of people were fleeing the unrest. `` We are losing our people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> was quoted as saying in Pravda. The situation in the southern region remained tense, with mass meetings in many towns in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> despite the presence of Soviet troops, tanks and a strict curfew, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON> said. Authorities have confiscated homemade pistols, sawed-off rifles and explosives from young people in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said. He said said the death toll includes Armenians, Azerbaijanis, a Russian, a Byelorussian and a Ukrainian. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, at the end of a three-day conference of the Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership announced plans for the parliament's Presidium, the highest state executive body, to hold a meeting of party, state and social organizations with national deputies from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region `` The Supreme Soviet appeals to workers of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to display wisdom and restraint,'' said a directive signed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that called for the meeting. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, two southern Soviet republics, are locked in a bitter dispute for control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. The area is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, but its predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February for annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> have rejected annexation. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s special representative in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, told the Supreme Soviet just before it adjourned that in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, `` nothing was done to eliminate the tension right away.'' `` The situation is boiling in both republics,'' <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> said. `` We are appealing to the peoples of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, it is time to stop.'' In <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, Pravda correspondents reported activists wearing red headbands gathered around bonfires on the streets at night, engaged in heated discussion of the violence. Many cities in the region are under military rule and strict curfews as a result of the unrest between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Official media in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> and in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said thousands of refugees were streaming across the border to their respective ethnic homelands. The official Armenian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION> said the latest round of killings began Nov. 22 and included a Moslem mullah. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Azruyan </PERSON>, the night editor in charge of Armenpress, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that the Azerbaijani mullah fired into a meeting of Armenians in the city of <LOCATION> Kalinino </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last week, `` but they threw stones at him. One hit him in the head and killed him.'' He said other deaths occurred in the cities of <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Krasnoselsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> but that there was no detailed information on how many died in each city or the circumstances. Earlier, four soldiers were killed protecting Armenian residents of the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION>, and soldiers shot and killed three civilians there for violating curfew. Violence also was reported in <LOCATION> Nakhichevan </LOCATION>, an Azerbaijani enclave between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the Iranian border. The dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> began in February. Mass demonstrations broke out, and at the end of February ethnic rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> killed at least 32 people. The latest unrest began in mid-November. Azerbaijanis accused <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> of sending settlers into <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to pad the Armenian majority there, of forcing Azerbaijanis out of work, and refusing them food and medical supplies. Official <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> radio, in a report monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said more than 20,000 ethnic Armenian refugees from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> had arrived since Nov. 22. It said many arrived in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> without clothing, money, or documents, and in need of medical treatment. It said empty houses had been requisitioned to shelter them.

 The Supreme Soviet voted overwhelmingly today to adopt <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overhaul of the political structure, but a handful of `` no'' votes and abstentions showed the reforms remain controversial. Five deputies in the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, voted against the package of constitutional amendments, which give more power to President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and provide for indirect election of the president and lawmakers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is also general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the deputies that a storm of controversy over the reforms _ including 250,000 letters to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ could have been reduced, and he took the blame. `` We did not care about explaining the essence, the meaning'' of the changes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The center was just following the old practice, thinking, well, they would get used to it.'' `` All of us are now learning our lessons. All of us are in a school of democracy, and we should be good pupils in that school,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In the Soviet of Nationalities, half of the bicameral <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the vote was 657 in favor, 3 against and 26 abstentions on amending the constitution to incorporate <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals The Soviet of Unions voted 687 in favor, 2 against with one abstention to approve the same measures. A companion package providing for multiple-candidate elections was adopted unanimously by both houses. At least three of the negative votes came from Estonians, whose tiny <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republic has declared its sovereignty from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The reforms create a strong presidency in place of the largely ceremonial role now accorded the head of state. They also establish a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to elect the president and a new Supreme Soviet, which will meet for eight months a year. Elections for the new congress were set for March 26, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said today's session was the last meeting of the current Supreme Soviet. He said no emergency sessions would be called before the elections. The package was being changed almost up until the final vote to incorporate objections from lawmakers and the public. Many of those who objected to various drafts said it gave too much power to one person. The most vociferous and widespread complaints came from independent-minded republics, including <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, which claimed the reforms would prevent them from governing their own affairs. The Supreme Soviet rejected <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s last-ditch request to be allowed to keep a single parliament in the republic, without creating a new congress. The reform provides for the same double-parliament structure in each of the republics as at the national level. The body also voted down an amendment that would effectively have given the republics veto power in the parliament. The revision was offered by <PERSON> Jemma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculme </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, another Baltic republic. The final version of the package was not immediately published in the official media, so it was n't known how many concessions were made before the vote. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has acknowledged the original version was flawed. After the vote, he gave a short speech praising the debate during the three-day special parliamentary session and the work of the deputies who helped make alterations. Until recently, the national legislature merely approved actions already taken by the leadership, without debate or dissent. This time, the Supreme Soviet heard 37 of its members criticize and propose changes in the plan submitted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The 1,500-member body recommended dozens of changes over two days of debate. On Wednesday, it asked the Presidium _ the nation's highest executive body _ and two committees to decide which suggestions to include in the final version The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the committees met Wednesday night, but it did not report details. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan includes more than 100 pieces of legislation. Several deputies opposed the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> idea because of two main elements _ indirect election of the Supreme Soviet and the proposal that one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members be chosen by social and political organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions. One of the main critics of the plan was the president of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON>. Estonian leaders declared Nov. 16 their republic is sovereign in all but defense and foreign affairs and has the right to veto Soviet laws. <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> told deputies Wednesday that no political system suits all parts of this vast nation, `` so we have developed our own.'' <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> came under repeated attack by delegates for its actions last month. The Presidium, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heads, nullified <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s declaration of sovereignty on Saturday.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the daughter of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s last freely elected leader, was named prime minister today and became the first woman to lead a Moslem nation in modern times. The appointment, combined with Wednesday's seating of an elected <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and four provincial assemblies, returned <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to democracy after the 11-year rule of Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and a caretaker government. President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said in a televised address that Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 35, had `` the best qualities of leadership and foresight as a statesman.'' He said he was convinced her <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party could command a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> following the country's first free elections in more than a decade <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> also announced the end of a state of emergency declared in August after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death in a plane crash. He did that, he said, `` so the new prime minister can take up her responsibility in an environment of complete democracy.'' He also said he had received the resignations of the post-Zia caretaker government, effective on Friday when Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> will take the oath of office. `` Ms. <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is a sound, educated, civilized, cultured and talented woman,'' said the president, speaking in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> language `` She has the best qualities of leadership and foresight of a statesman. She has the country's love in her heart.'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, congratulated her as `` the choice of the people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> will lead a nation dominated by the laws of Islam, which do not allowed women to appear in public without a veil covering their faces. Islamic scholars disagree on whether the Moslem holy book, the Koran, prohibits women from engaging in public life. But <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Constitution says a woman can become head of state. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party today picked up 12 more seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of parliament, after Wednesday's voting on 20 seats reserved exclusively for women. It meant her <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party commanded 105 votes in the 237-seat legislature. She said she had enough support from independents and minor parties to command a majority over the conservative eight-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which rallied <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> loyalists. It was a triumph for the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> forces who had been in political exile since Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in a bloodless 1977 coup. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was executed in 1979 after he was convicted of conspiring to kill a political rival. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has pledged to help restore democracy to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others were killed in a Aug. 17 plane crash. An investigation found sabotage as a probable cause for the crash, but no arrests have been made and the probe is continuing.

 The liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis and five military astronauts on a secret spy satellite mission was postponed today for 24 hours by fierce winds eight miles above the launch site. `` We were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed due to winds aloft,'' said launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>. Weather officials reported the wind velocity 41,000 feet up was 104 mph, a condition that could seriously damage the wings of a shuttle passing through and cause the vehicle to break up. <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said launch officials had decided to try again on Friday morning, but that a final decision on whether to proceed would be made about 9:30 p.m. tonight before the shuttle is fueled. `` We're going to take a hard look at the weather again,'' he said. `` If it is clearly a no-go tomorrow, we do n't want to exercise the launch team, the crew and the systems.'' The time for a launch Friday would be sometime between 6:32 and 9:32 a.m. EST, the same as for today. The exact moment remained a secret because the mission is classified, but sources said the target was about 7 a.m. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madura </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist, said the storm front that brought winds, rain and clouds to the area today would be offshore in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on Friday. But in its wake, he said, there could be strong ground winds that could affect a launch. <PERSON> Madura </PERSON> said that at 8:55 a.m., when the scrub announcement was made, the low-level clouds, rain and winds had moved away, but the high altitude winds remained above limits. <PERSON> Madura </PERSON> said that if Friday's weather was unacceptable, the outlook for Saturday was not too good, with continued strong ground winds. `` Sunday appears to be the best of the three days,'' he said. The countdown, blacked out publicly for security reasons, stood at nine minutes when the scrub was called, sources reported. It had been held there for more than an hour while officials waited in vain for a significant break in the weather. The astronauts, who had boarded the spacecraft shortly after 4 a.m. in their bulky escape suits, returned to crew quarters seven miles from the launch pad. `` They took it in stride,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said of their reaction to the scrub. `` We had talked about this threat ever since we picked up the count, so it came as no surprise.'' The postponement was nothing new for the crew commander, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. As commander of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on the 24th mission, he had experienced a recordd seven postponements and had to board the ship six times before finally taking off. Technicians promptly began emptying the huge external fuel tank of the half-million gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that had been pumped aboard overnight. The fuel will be reused for the next attempt at launching. The forecast for this morning had been ominous for days, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> knew it was gambling when it decided to load the fuel tank. the space agency has estimated the costs of a last-minute scrub at about $ 250,000. The fickle weather at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> launch site has been a persistent problem, forcing numerous delays and postponements of previous shuttle launches. Weather criteria for launch have been tightened since the Challenger explosion of January 1986. There also was a report of unacceptable weather at the runway across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> where the shuttle might have to land if one or two engines failed early into the flight. Favorable weather is especially critical in case Atlantis develops trouble immediately after liftoff and has to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Safety considerations call for clouds no lower than 8,000 feet above the runway, seven miles visibility and surface winds less than 14 mph. Rain on liftoff or landing could damage the ship's thermal protection tiles, and high winds aloft could damage the craft structurally, especially its wings. The go-ahead for fueling came after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> reported that repairmen using glue had succeeded in fastening a loose panel back onto Atlantis' nose. Atlantis' flight is the second by a shuttle since missions resumed after the 1986 Challenger accident. It is the third mission for <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, the newest ship in the shuttle fleet. There have been two previous secret <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flights _ both in 1985. Though neither <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will discuss the cargo, sources said the shuttle was to launch a $ 500 million spy satellite called Lacrosse. The sources said the satellite carries a powerful new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of military targets in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Lacrosse is expected to act as the radar `` eye in the sky'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber. The quick-fix repair job Wednesday was in response to a problem with bolts on a cover of a service panel in the orbiter's nose. The panel is used to fill the fuel tanks of the shuttle's forward steering rockets. When the launch pad crew attempted to replace the cover to the panel, two of 10 bolts failed. The workers then used glue, heated by lamps, to secure the edges of the 1 -LCB- - by-2-foot panel cover As with the previous military flights, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the prelaunch secrecy was necessary to foil surveillance efforts by Soviet satellites and by spy ships off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. Once Atlantis is in orbit, all space-to-ground communication will be encoded and there will be only the barest of public announcements, in contrast with the launch-to-liftoff eavesdropping that is usual on shuttle missions. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s crew members are <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the pilot, and mission specialists Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt.

 Black residents today announced a consumer boycott of white-owned stores in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, one of several towns where right-wing officials have reimposed strict apartheid measures. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- wants to keep its town white. We are going to grant them their Christmas wish,'' said <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON>, who heads the management committee in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s mixed-race township of Reiger Park. <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON> also told reporters blacks and people of mixed-race would stage a sit-in Friday at <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, which recently was reserved for whites. Four South African sporting bodies announced sanctions against towns attempting to increase race segregation. Governing organizations for cricket, golf, cycling and men's field hockey in separate statements said they have canceled competitions or will refuse to give funds to towns, schools and clubs that encourage discrimination Also today, a handcuffed black teen-ager plunged to his death from the seventh floor of an apartment building while in the custody of police investigators who alleged he was a guerrilla, the police commissioner said. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which captured dozens of town councils in Oct. 26 elections, has touched off a storm of controversy with its efforts to ban blacks from public facilities integrated in recent years. This week three councils in towns outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> _ have voted to resegregate parks, town halls and swimming pools and to bar blacks from owning businesses in town. Other communities announced similar plans. The Conservatives view limited race reforms by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as capitulation to the nation's 26-million black majority. <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON> predicted the boycott `` will be disastrous for <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>,'' whose white businessmen depend heavily on the town's more than 150,000 blacks and people of mixed-race <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> has 87,000 whites. Mayor <PERSON> Beyers </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> vowed not to soften his stance. `` I am here to fight to survive and I expect all the thunderbolts in hell to rain down on me,'' he said. Meanwhile <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> restated his party policy of segregated neighborhoods. `` The government maintains its position, namely the maintenance of own communities for every population group,'' he said Wednesday night. Minister of Constitutional Development <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> warned town councils not to `` sabotage'' national policy. `` Such ill-considered action by irresponsible people can in one day destroy attitudes and relationships that have been built up through years of hard work,'' <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said. He gave no indication the government planned to change laws allowing local authorities to discriminate. Newspapers accused the government of hypocrisy, noting National Party-controlled cities maintain segregated facilities ranging from buses to beaches. Regarding the death of the black suspect, Gen. <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoza </PERSON>, 18, `` managed to throw himself over a wall and consequently fell to his death.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said a high-ranking officer would investigate the incident. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>'s statement said <PERSON> Khoza </PERSON> was arrested today in <LOCATION> Klerksdorp </LOCATION>, a town west of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, because police believed he had `` terrorist weapons.'' <PERSON> Khoza </PERSON> was brought to central <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to identify an apartment where he purportedly made contact with a member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, de <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khoza </PERSON> was recruited by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and was to have received guerrilla training abroad. There have been numerous incidents in recent years where suspects have died while in the company of police investigators. Police say some were shot and killed while trying to escape and others leaped to their deaths from windows. Also today, police reported five black men were stabbed to death in separate attacks in strife-torn townships near southeastern <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> city. Four men were arrested in the attacks.

<HEAD>Former Police Chief Charged With Nepotism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOMINY, Okla (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A misdemeanor charge of nepotism is the only charge that came out of an investigation of the town's former police chief, a black man who charged racial bias after he was fired amid allegations of misconduct. The nepotism charge was filed against former chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 45, who had been accused of sexually harassing female employees. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> is accused of appointing a sister-in-law as a temporary police department employee Sept. 7. He was fired Oct. 6, and his sister-in-law no longer works in the department. District Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said Tuesday that state law prohibits an elected official from appointing or hiring any person related to him by marriage or blood within the third degree. The charge carries a fine of between $ 100 and $ 1,000 and forfeiture of office. Allegations against <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> had included sexual involvement with dispatchers and juveniles, sexual harassment of other female employees, preferential treatment for some residents and harsh handling of others. One former dispatcher has filed a paternity suit against him. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said city officials who opposed having a black chief conspired to oust him, using allegations that he had affairs with white police dispatchers to raise the ire of the all-white City Council. The town of 3,000 people has about 150 blacks. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> issued a statement saying the nearly two-month investigation by his office and the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> `` failed to produce substantiated evidence, or victims who desired to pursue criminal charges.'' He said matters alleged to have occurred more than three years ago were not investigated because the statute of limitations had expired. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said he expected no other charges against <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and the city have been named in a $ 4.4 million civil rights lawsuit in federal court that alleges the former lawman sexually harassed employees and strong-armed residents to collect merchants' debts.

 Strong winds and cloudy skies hampered helicopter search and rescue operations today in battered coastal regions and tiny sand bars where more than 500 people were reported dead after a cyclone. The cyclone lashed the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> coast Tuesday night, churning up 15-foot-high waves that submerged low-lying islands and pounding the mainland with winds up to 102 mph. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers said at least 500 people died and more than 1,000 were missing in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. In neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, police sources said about 80 people were killed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. Cyclones and floods traditionally have ravaged the low-lying region. In 1970, 300,000 people died in a cyclone. In 1985, the death toll reached 10,000 when another cyclone pelted the region. Official figures in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on the latest storm were much lower, reflecting bureaucratic delays and the nearly impossible task of obtaining information from areas where communications are poor even in good weather. The human toll and the difficulty in accurately assessing it were augmented by the settlement of thousands of peasants and fishermen on newly emerging islands off the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> coast. Hundreds of these islands, most of them narrow sand bars that are partially submerged each day even by normal tides, have been created by silt and sediment dumped into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> from the rivers that originate in the Himalayas of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, official sources said the death toll in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was 350. In <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state, a senior police officer insisted he had only five confirmed death reports for the entire state, even though other <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday night that 29 people were known to have perished in the storm. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> put <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s death toll at 870, saying this included 500 fishermen caught in the storm. The cyclone struck while <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was still trying to recover from last summer's floods that killed about 1,500 people and destroyed the homes of more than one-fifth of the population of 110 million. Two <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers _ the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the independent <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> _ said about 500 people died from electrocution, drowning, or when houses collapsed on them. The newspapers said a few thousand were injured. <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> said at least 412 people were killed in the southwestern districts of coastal <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> and inland <LOCATION> Jessore </LOCATION>, with most of the other deaths reported in a swath of districts along the coast. Up to 900 fishermen were missing at <LOCATION> Dublar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Char </LOCATION>, a half-mile-wide strip of land in the bay off the <LOCATION> Sunderban </LOCATION> forest, <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> said. The Bengali-language newspaper said about 275 more fishermen were missing off the island of <LOCATION> Kutubdia </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> area adjacent to the <LOCATION> Sunderban </LOCATION> forest, the storm razed hundreds of mud huts used by fishermen. `` Our home kept rattling and shaking,'' said <PERSON> Ashim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Diamond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> said three of his cows died when his house collapsed. The cyclone also took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and palm-thatch dwellings used by Bangladeshi fishermen and rice farmers. Some official sources estimated that tens of thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of people, were left homeless in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Heavy winds and cloudy skies grounded some military helicopters that were to be used for relief operations, but official sources said some were able to start ferrying relief materials. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> canceled an inspection tour of the coast today because of the poor weather.

 <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> school officials are close to accepting <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to manage their beleaguered public schools, but opponents vow to continue their legal challenges. `` I think it presents a new hope for the community,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimini </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aldermen </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday, the day after school committee officials tentatively backed the plan by a 5-2 vote. Officials said they expect to have a contract within the next few weeks. The unprecedented offer has been under negotiation for three years. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>'s 3,400-student district has the highest dropout rate in the state and has not built a school since 1923. But union lawyers say public officials are willing to cede too much power to the university and they will continue their legal challenge to the plan despite failing to get an injunction to stop Tuesday's vote. `` It's not over yet,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. The unions are challenging the plan on the grounds it is against state law to put a tax-funded institution under private management. University officials maintain they will not be taking the public schools private but will simply be managers who have to answer to the School Committee. `` I think that it takes an awful lot of courage on the part of the city to say, ` Hey, look we've tried our best, the money's just not there,''' <PERSON> Zimini </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately in our society any kind of change is always a fear factor.'' The working-class town on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, with its influx of Hispanic and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants, has been strained financially by a small tax base, elderly population and a 1980 state tax-limiting law. <PERSON> Zimini </PERSON> said he can not predict how aldermen will vote but believes the contract will be approved. The pact also requires enabling legislation by state lawmakers. The university proposes to revamp the curricula, build new schools, provide mothers and pregnant teen-agers with counseling on nutrition and child-rearing, tailor learning plans to individual students and set up after-school programs.

 The left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc deadlocked today in rival efforts to form a coalition government after one of four key religious parties defected from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to Labor. The move by the five-member, <ORGANIZATION> ultra-Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agudat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gave Labor the support of 60 lawmakers in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> _ not enough to form a government but enough to block <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which has the backing of 58 legislators. The balance of power now is in the hands of the undecided <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has two seats. Party leader Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitz </PERSON> said he preferred a broad-based government but did n't `` rule out the possibility that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> will form the government.'' It is the latest turnaround in complicated negotiations since Nov. 1 elections in which Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats while <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, won 39. At the city's Wailing Wall today, ultra-Orthodox Jews shouted angrily as 100 feminists carried a Torah and held a 30-minute all-woman prayer session. They defied Orthodox rules forbidding women from carrying or reading the book of Jewish literature. Men pounded on the fence traditionally dividing them from the women, some of whom wore prayer shawls and skullcaps traditionally worn by males. `` I protest. In the name of God I protest,'' shouted a grey-bearded Jews as the women prayed and sang. The prayer session marked the end of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, attended by women from more than 20 countries. `` They should realize that prayer is n't only for men,'' said <PERSON> Blu </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The feminists represented Reform or Conservative branches of Judaism which do not adhere to some Orthodox rules excluding women from Jewish rituals. On <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he still is optimistic of meeting President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>'s request that he form a government. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appeared to have firm support of 65 legislators. But religious parties started bolting when he asked Labor to join the government, fearing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would break promises to them to accommodate Labor. Political alignments were shaken again when <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s Executive Bureau, in an apparent rebellion against its party leadership, voted Wednesday not to join a Likud-led government. The Labor leader said he would try to form a narrow government. `` It's difficult when five members can topple the government whenever they want,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television interview. His chances improved after Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed to join a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government. Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Rabbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Porusch </PERSON> said his party was angered by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s advances toward Labor. `` Likud was supposed to reach an agreement with us,'' <PERSON> Porusch </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` But instead, the Likud ... wanted to reach an agreement with Labor.'' He reiterated that his party would join only a coalition promising to pass legislation giving Orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Porusch </PERSON> acknowledged Labor leaders promised only to take the matter before the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The so-called `` Who is a Jew'' legislation has enraged American Jews, most of whom belong to Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism that would be excluded from getting automatic Israeli citizenship.

 A man has been acquitted of a charge of manufacturing and distributing a so-called designer drug known as `` ecstasy'' because the drug's lengthy scientific name was misspelled in state law. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burling </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Kenesaw </PERSON>, was charged with making and selling methylenedioxymethamphetamine, more commonly known as MDMA or `` ecstasy.'' Designer drugs are formulated to have the effect of an illegal drug without being specifically outlawed. Adams County District Judge <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Burling </PERSON> did not violate the law since he did not possess the drug named in the state statute. <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatheway </PERSON> argued that the discrepency was a typographical error and that the intent of the law was to make MDMA illegal.

 A top buyout firm won the tumultuous war for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> with the biggest takeover on record, a $ 24.53 billion offer that derailed a rival bid by <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> executives who triggered the bidding frenzy. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> directors approved the $ 109-a-share offer by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday, capping a day of frantic, confusing maneuvering in the auction of the cigarette-and-food giant A member of the competing investment group led by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said their last-minute offer _ $ 25.42 billion or $ 112 per share _ had been higher, but suggested the group had been cheated by an unfair bidding process. The value of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 19th largest industrial company was nearly double the old takeover record, $ 13.4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Although the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> group's offer appeared to be higher, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said its board of directors concluded <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was substantially equal. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>'s offer per share broke down to $ 81 in cash, $ 18 in stock and additional securities worth $ 10, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Board of Directors of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, by unanimous vote of all directors present, adopted the <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> offer as being in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,'' the company said. RJR did not say exactly why <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer prevailed. The breakdown of the Johnson group's bid was not disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street firm that was one of its key financial partners, said, `` From what we know, our bid was the best.'' `` We are mystified about the process and the standards that the board used to reach its decision,'' it said in a statement. `` We are going to continue to keep our options open. We believe the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will have a lot of questions as well.'' <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was happy with the outcome. `` We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so that the employees of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, its consumers and suppliers and the communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return to normal and stability will be restored,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two principals, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said in a statement. However, the deal raised the prospect that some businesses in one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest consumer product companies might be sold to help <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> pay for its prize. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> gave no indication which of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide operations might be discarded. There was speculation that candidates could include some or all of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s food businesses. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco business roots still account for about 40 percent of its sales. Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer products companies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. Its brands include such well-known products as Camel cigarettes, Shredded Wheat and Life Savers. The deal's size and complexity have raised major questions about whether the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and debt-financed restructurings has gone too far in transforming much of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The deal also signaled a spectacular defeat for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose group began the struggle to take the company private with a $ 75-a-share offer on Oct. 20 that was raised five times. `` I am proud that we put the best bid on the table the first time and this time,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a statement following <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s victory It was not clear whether the scrappy, daring executive would try to reopen the war. His tenure as head of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> was even less certain. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> would install <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s former chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sticht </PERSON>, in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition. The newspaper said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> would move the company's corporate headquarters back to <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group tried to raise its bid after a company-decreed deadline for all offers expired. The move temporarily upended a $ 106-a-share, $ 23.8 billion <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> board was about to approve. In heavy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stock shot up $ 2.25 to $ 93 a share on the possibility the auction would be prolonged. In early trading today, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> was off 75 cents to $ 92.25 a share. Sources familiar with the bidding who spoke on condition of anonymity said the offer of a third contender, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was rejected as too tentative, although the bidder valued it as high as $ 115 a share or $ 25.87 billion. When the battle began in October, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stock was trading at less than $ 56 a share. For <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who held on for the last five wild weeks, their pretax gain totals nearly 95 percent.

Police were investigating whether Battle, arrested Nov. 20 and charged with burglary and theft, ever actually examined patients during his hospital rounds. A nurse became suspicious of Battle when he entered a labor-delivery scrub room wearing gloves from a neighboring hospital. Questioned about what he was doing, Battle gave the name of a patient he planned to examine.

 Residents popped champagne corks and cut a cake as they celebrated the closing of a nearby landfill that fouled the air and lured thousands of seagulls into the area. About 50 residents on Wednesday applauded from across the street as they watched a city worker close the gate for the final time. `` We're celebrating. The seagulls will finally leave,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>. The 137-acre landfill opened 14 years ago and received about 1,500 tons of garbage daily. Garbage is piled more than 100 feet high. `` It's long overdue. The odor is terrible,'' said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> <PERSON> Askwith </PERSON>. Although the dump is now closed, some residents fear groundwater filtering through the dump will pollute nearby <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The closing of the landfill means that <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>'s 3,000 tons of garbage a day will be trucked to the city's remaining landfill on the Northside.

Ms. <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON> said she personally cooked for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Helga </PERSON>, and for their dogs, who were fed `` very special meals'' _ boned chicken breast mixed with dog food. The witness said she also performed in musical concerts as a singer and violinist, adding that some performances were for guests while others were just for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. Prosecutors questioned Ms. <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON> about the lifestyle <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was leading at a time when people who loaned more than $ 30 million to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s movement were not getting repaid.

In earlier testimony, the trial was told that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s `` security'' fund was used to pay for items including a piano, haircuts, flowers, shoes and cufflinks, according to testimony in his tax fraud trial <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> financial officer <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> acknowledged on Wednesday that the movement's security account paid for items which _ according to prosecutors _ should have been declared as taxable income. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A grand jury accused him of failing to declare as income the personal and household expenses financed by his organizations, and of refusing to file federal tax returns since 1979. By calling Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> to the stand, prosecutors continued using a strategy of compelling <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aides to testify about the movement's finances under grants of limited immunity from prosecution. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>'s testimony would not only support the tax count, but charges that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six co-defendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not repaying their loans to his organizations. The personal expenditures cited by Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> were made while the LaRouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was available to repay some $ 25 million of the more than $ 30 million lent to the movement. About $ 5 million was repaid, according to earlier testimony. Trying to rebut the personal expense testimony, defense lawyers attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was for legitimate security and research purposes _ not for his personal benefit. The defense effort was cut short, however, by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He refused to allow any defense questioning of Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> on the movement's need for consultants, who were paid weekly, monthly, daily, and flat payments. Defense lawyers described the consultants as national security experts. The defense struck out, too, when it tried to question the witness about payments for security protection for two Latin American members of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s organization. The defense contended they were threatened by drug dealers, and were given refuge with their families in <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, estate. The government, on the other hand, was permitted to introduce a memo prepared by Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, in which she said listing consultant payments under `` legal investigations, services rendered for personal research'' was `` not a particularly defensible position under <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny.'' Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> testified that she really did n't know if the expenses were listed improperly under <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> regulations. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the prosecutor, had Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> read for jurors some of the expenses from LaRouche's `` security'' fund, which was designed for the personal security of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, his aides and his guests. Among the items was a $ 7,000 piano and furniture for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION> estate; cufflinks, for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>; shoes for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helga </PERSON>; film; clothes for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>; flowers; luggage costing $ 415.96; a hairdresser appointment for Mrs. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and a $ 10 haircut for LaRouche; a $ 25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person, and reimbursement for a wine purchase Ms. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> said the furniture and piano were for a building where the LaRouche organization scheduled political and cultural events. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political movement embraces a number of unorthodox positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving such figures as former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and the queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.

 A strong aftershock in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s quake-stricken border region destroyed 620 houses and injured 13 people, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday The aftershock, which measured 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit Wednesday and was centered in the same remote mountain region of <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province devastated by a Nov. 6 quake in which 730 people died and more than 4,000 were injured. Many of the buildings destroyed in Wednesday's aftershock suffered damage from the initial quake and were not inhabited, officials said. Many local residents have been living in tents. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said a lead mine and cement factory in <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, near the epicenter, suffered new damage in the aftershock and were forced to close. More than 1,000 aftershocks, most far weaker, have hit the region since the Nov. 6 quake, which measured 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake measuring 7.0 or greater is capable of causing heavy damage in a populated area. The Nov. 6 quake was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most devastating since the 1976 earthquake that leveled the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION>, killing an estimated 242,000 people.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Warning Switch On Delta Jet That Crashed Was Corroded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE PEGO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The switch for a takeoff warning system aboard <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 was corroded, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineer today told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. But engineer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board that the F197 throttle switch taken from the plane after it crashed Aug. 31 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing 14 of the 108 people aboard, subsequently passed engineering and circuitry tests. The system would have warned the pilots if the jet's wing flaps were improperly set for takeoff. The flaps provide extra lift during the slow speeds of takeoff and landing. Some of the flaps were found in the incorrect position after the crash, but it is not known whether they were set that way or whether they were moved out of position by the impact or by mechanical failure in the flap controls. An exhibit by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> indicated `` the switch exhibited blue-green corrosion-type substance around the normally open terminals on the exterior of the housing.'' The exhibit also said the plunger hole on the switch was enlarged. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said before the public hearing began Tuesday that its experts believed the plane's takeoff warning system was inoperative and that the pilots had no idea that the plane's flaps were improperly set _ some up, some down. Ryder said the switch worked perfectly in tests of circuitry designed to resemble that of the plane. But upon questioning, <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> said the same switch had not worked in other tests by an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator. During his test, <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> said, the button and the plunger of the switch slipped by each other, meaning they did n't make contact. He blamed the failure on `` mismanipulation,'' saying the installation was different from wha one would find on a 727. Ryder said any problems with inoperative switches should be found during routine maintenance and that the switches are virtually self-cleaning, brushing the contacts clean with each use. Witness <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said his company's three engines mounted on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 showed no sign of damage that might have occurred before the crash The third engine showed major interior damage, but <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he believed the evidence indicated the damage must have occurred after the crash. On Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aerodynamics supervisor testified that the plane was traveling fast enough to fly even if its flaps had been retracted. Investigators have been puzzled by the fact the plane's flap handle was found up, the retracted position, although some of the plane's flaps and slats were extended. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials say the hearing is only for fact-gathering and that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public in six months. All three crew members agreed before the board that, to the best of their recollection, they made all necessary preflight preparations, including setting the flaps, although they may have bent several <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> regulations. One of their admitted technical violations was allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit during a long delay before takeoff.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> left the presidency Thursday after leading <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> through six difficult years in which the measure of his success was avoiding bankruptcy and social upheaval. As he put it in a newspaper interview this week: `` I took a country with great problems and leave it with problems.'' Tradition dictates that de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, at age 53, retire to a quiet life away from politics, or go to the Mexican Embassy of his choice if he has a taste for diplomacy. He leaves office with a much better image than his predecessor, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, whose populist ideology and financial mismanagement _ combined with the collapse of world oil prices _ almost led to bankruptcy. So deep was the crisis in 1982 that even de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s critics say avoiding disaster was a major accomplishment. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> takes more personal pride in reforms that opened <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s political system to the opposition at the expense of his <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish initials PRI. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who succeeded him Thursday, won a much narrower victory than customary for candidates of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, which has controlled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s government since it was founded in 1929. Party faithful were shocked this week when de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said in an interview he foresees a time, `` as Mexican society matures, when the opposition will share in the government.'' During his six-year term, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> also attacked some sacred political and economic cows by reducing protectionism and state control of the economy. Among other things, he pushed his country into the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. A close associate said: `` He had the courage to take unpopular measures.'' There was a price, for the president and his party. The opposition took 237 of 500 congressional seats in the July 6 elections and still claims <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won the presidency by fraud. When de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> took office, the treasury was almost empty and economic disaster was at hand. His term was one of crisis management, negotiations under pressure with political, labor and business groups at home and with international banks pressing for payments on a foreign debt reached $ 104 billion at one point. He resisted urgings to suspend debt payments, choosing instead to bargain with banks and other creditors for better terms. By the middle of this year, foreign exchange reserves had reached $ 16 billion and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was making debt payments of up to $ 14 billion a year. Among the disasters he could not control were the collapse of oil prices from $ 32 a barrel to under $ 15, an earthquake in 1985 that killed an estimated 9,000 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Hurricane Gilbert in September. Asked whether he considered himself a bad-luck president, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> smiled and said: `` No, just a difficult-times president.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had no economic growth and workers lost nearly half their real wages because pay was kept low while prices climbed. Political opponents claimed his economic policies favored private business. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> replied that sacrifices were needed to maintain a productive source of employment. Last year, he enlisted labor and business in the `` Economic Solidarity Pact'' to fight inflation. The annual rate was 140 percent in 1987, but is expected to be down to 40 percent this year. Private business leaders, critics of the government in the past, praised de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s sale of state-owned companies, his austerity measures and his programs to boost exports. `` If this continues, the country's economy will grow quickly,'' said <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorreta </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said today it will close the Yugoslav Consulate and expel its staff if authorities there do n't turn over a security guard who shot a teen-age demonstrator <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> rejected the demand. The moves were the latest in a diplomatic wrangle over the wounding of the youth on Sunday and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s refusal to apologize formally for the shooting at its consulate in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. In a statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the Yugoslav government said Australian officials `` failed to undertake measures to protect our consulate'' from attackers. The security guard `` had no choice but shooting into the air to warn Australian organs ... that lives and security of workers in the consulate and their families were directly imperiled,'' the statement said. The statement was in response to one issued earlier by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> saying the Australian government had sufficient evidence to prosecute the security guard who fired the gun. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> demanded that the guard, identified as <PERSON> Matijas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoran </PERSON>, be handed over to police by 6 p.m. Friday or `` the Australian government will immediately close the consulate-general.'' About 1,500 people protested at the consulate on Sunday, Yugoslav National Day. Police said a security guard fired on hundreds of demonstrators when several Croatian youths began climbing the walls. <PERSON> Jospeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokic </PERSON>, 16, was shot in the throat and was in stable condition at a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> hospital. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> government referred to the demonstrators as Ustashas, Croatian fascists who allied with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> resistance forces during World War II. Yugoslav Ambassador <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cizelj </PERSON> allowed police to question the guard after consulting with his government in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. But he insisted the interview be conducted inside the consulate and in the presence of the consul-general. He said <PERSON> Zoran </PERSON> would not leave the country until police complete their investigation. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> government lodged an official protest over what it called a lack of police protection during the demonstration.

<HEAD>Fernald Plant to Lay Off 350 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government's Fernald uranium-processing plant will lay off about 350 employees soon because of decreased demand for the enriched uranium it produces, officials announced today. The layoff, the second since April at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Feed Materials Production Center, will include both management and production-line employees and could begin before Christmas, said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the plant's operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Workers to be affected will be notified Dec. 9, he said. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said the layoffs have nothing to do with a strike by 625 unionized production workers, which has idled the plant since Oct. 7. Westinghouse Materials laid off 70 employees at the government plant in April because of declining orders for uranium and said then that another layoff was likely later this year. `` They would have occurred anyway, because the production is down substantially for this fiscal year from last,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. The plant's operating budget last year was $ 145 million but was cut to $ 107 million this year, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it will provide affected employees with job counseling, asistance with resume writing, interview skills training and a placement center. The plant now employs about 1,500 people. It has supplied uranium recently for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky Flats plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reactors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, nuclear complex. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors are shut down because of problems there, and the Rocky Flats plant reportedly is under consideration for eventual closure by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Fernald plant, located 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, has been under heavy criticism in recent years. The Energy Department recently admitted that the plant has released at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere during its 37 years of operation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday blocked the executions of two Sikhs condemned to death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, news reports said. A panel of five justices granted a stay of execution for <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a guard who shot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, convicted of conspiracy. The two were scheduled to hang Friday but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stay the execution until Tuesday in order to hear arguments on a petition filed by <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s son. They are not related. Members of the Sikh faith use the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion. The petition challenges President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>'s refusal to grant clemency to his father without reviewing the merits of the case, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> last week said he could not go into the merits of a case already decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The petition filed by <PERSON> Rajinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, however, contends the Constitution gives the president such powers, the news agencies said. The judges also stayed <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s execution after his lawyer appealed against another high court decision dismissing his appeals earlier in the day. Two Sikh bodyguards, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, shot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in the garden of her residence on Oct. 31, 1984. She was apparently killed in retaliation for an army raid she ordered four months earlier to rout militants from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than 1,200 people died, most of them Sikhs. <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was killed in a shootout with other security guards and is revered as a martyr by many militant Sikhs. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON>'s uncle, was arrested a month later and charged with helping to plot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s murder, which triggered anti-Sikh riots across northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by members of the majority Hindu religion. More than 2,700 people died, nearly all of them Sikhs. Sikh violence since then has escalated. More than 2,300 people have died this year alone in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, where Sikhs are fighting for an independent homeland. Authorities had ordered increased security in the capital and in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, fearing the executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal violence. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 54, and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 30, have been held at the maximum-security Tihar Central Jail in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> since their arrests in 1984.

 Police arrested members of the Mafia in cities throughout <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> today as a similar sweep targeting drug-trafficking rings took place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said authorities involved in operation `` Iron Tower'' began arresting people during the night in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, in a statement released in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, said drug charges have been filed against 75 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 133 people in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. He said the arrests were under way in nine unspecified Italian cities and in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, Ill. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the people named in the Italian arrest warrants were members of the Satola, <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inzerillo </PERSON> crime families in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The state-run RAI-TV said several top Mafia figures were among those arrested. Italian news agencies said the drug raids resulted from an investigation that stemmed from the `` Pizza Connection'' international drug ring that sold $ 1.6 billion of heroin, mostly through pizzerias in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring and Italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged involvement. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> and the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said the investigation that led to today's raids was triggered by the arrest of women drug couriers at airports in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two years ago. It said the women were paid about $ 7,800 for every 2.2 pounds of heroin they smuggled from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> inside money belts. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents used court-authorized wiretaps, physical surveillance and heroin and cocaine buys to develop the evidence that led to the arrests in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Sessions said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also discovered cocaine was being sent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a laboratory 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, to be processed and sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the cocaine was then exchanged for heroin that was smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers Thursday urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to boost defense spending, upgrade military equipment and play a greater role in maintaining a strong Western alliance. The recommendations came in a `` burden-sharing'' report that responds to criticism from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman who argue the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is picking up too much of the defense tab. Ministers adopted the report at the start of a two-day meeting. The report acknowledged `` significant differences between individual national contributions.'' But it contended countries such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> bear high social costs because of 400,000 foreign troops stationed there. West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said the review on his country was `` rather positive. I did n't expect it any other way.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics have suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdraw some of its 326,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the Europeans do not pay more. `` As the alliance approaches its 40th anniversary, its strength and cohesion remain as firm as ever, with continuing major contributions being made by both the European and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pillars,'' the report said. But it noted both rich and poor countries have earmarked for defense less and less as a percentage of total economic activity or gross domestic product. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> were singled out for maintaining or increasing slightly their levels of defense spending. Allocating money for defense was crucial. `` But making available people and space, accepting limitations in personal freedom or the quality of life, braving internal or external tensions, and different degrees of exposure or vulnerability are by no means less important elements of the overall burden,'' the report said. It estimated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tagged an average 5.98 percent of its economic output to defense from 1983 to 1987. Well ahead was <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, which spent 6.52 percent. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> devoted 5.01 percent of its GDP to defense; <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> averaged 4 percent, and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 3.2 percent. Others were: <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 3.26 percent; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 2.17 percent; <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 2.2 percent; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 2.16 percent; <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, 1.18 percent; <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 3.32 percent; <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, 2.93 percent; <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, 3.22 percent; and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 2.37 percent. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> was not included in the table. All <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 nations except <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the report. The report praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for `` an exceptional and sustained effort to modernize and upgrade all aspects of its armed forces.'' But it said the defense spending surge `` seems to have come to an end and is likely to be followed by a period of stabilization.'' European countries, it said, provide 90 percent of the manpower, 80 percent of combat aircraft, 70 percent of tanks and 80 percent of artillery in the alliance. But it urged many European members and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to make bigger contributions.

<HEAD>US, Italian Police Crack Mafia Drug Ring; Arrests in 8 U.S. Cities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian authorities announced today they have charged more than 200 people, including major figures in the Sicilian Mafia, in a joint undercover operation targeting international cocaine and heroin drug-trafficking rings in both countries. Arrests were under way in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, Ill. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, arrests were being made in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. Among the 75 people charged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 133 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were some of the `` top leaders'' of organized crime, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said that, by midday, 52 people had been arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 22 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Sessions said the arrests culminated a `` long-term, undercover operation'' that he said `` builds strong cases against top leaders'' of organized crime. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it used court-authorized wiretaps, physical surveillance and heroin and cocaine buys to develop evidence leading to the arrests here and in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said the two-year investigation that led to the raids stemmed from the `` Pizza Connection'' international drug ring that sold $ 1.6 billion of heroin, mostly through pizzerias in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring, and Italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged involvement. At <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declined to comment about any tie-in between the Pizza Connection and the current probe. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the operation developed from what originally were independent criminal probes in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. They grew into a coordinated probe when agents found links between many of the targets of the separate investigations. The Buffalo case was initially designed to concentrate on drug-trafficking rings in the western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and was code named `` Busico,'' which stands for `` Buffalo Sicilian Connection.'' It ultimately became tied to a probe in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> called the `` Iron Tower'' case, eventually requiring the cooperation of six <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> field offices, three Italian police agencies, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agencies and overseas support of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents traveled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to discuss major drug buys. Italian police inspectors worked with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on the investigation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said police were seeking at least 37 people there who were named in arrest warrants issued by anti-Mafia magistrate <PERSON> Giovanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>. It said all the people named in the warrants were members of the <PERSON> Spatola </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inzerillo </PERSON> crime families in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The state-run RAI-TV said Italian authorities, with the help of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators, arrested several top Mafia figures. It said 300 policemen, helped by helicopters and dogs, were reportedly employed in the sweep. As one part of the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it developed information that cocaine was being sent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a laboratory 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. There the cocaine was processed and sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and exchanged for heroin that was shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> told Spanish and Italian authorities about the exchange and arrests were subsequently made in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the probe that led to the raids began after the arrest of women drug couriers at airports in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two years ago. It said the women were paid $ 7,800 for every two pounds of heroin they smuggled from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> inside money belts.

<HEAD>One Man Dead in Pier Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRO BAY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire burned an oil-soaked pier today, killing one man and destroying at least 11 boats and two cars, authorities said. A tower of black smoke hung over the area, and some people were evacuated. The dead man was asleep in his boat when the fire broke out and spread to his vessel, said <ORGANIZATION> Morro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpster </PERSON>. At least two other people were injured in the early morning blaze. Authorities ordered the evacuation of an area downwind from the fire for about a quarter-mile after hearing reports that the pier was treated with creosote, a carcinogenic substance. The waterfront of this town 175 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is lined with restaurants and souvenir shops along a strip known as the embarcadero. The pier that burned was known as the T Pier because of its shape. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, said they saw the fire break out and after <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> called the Fire Department they returned to the pier to knock on boats and awaken the live-aboard occupants. Shortly afterward, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, `` The fire just went whoosh'' and engulfed the pier off the city's waterfront. `` There's a huge cloud of dark, oily smoke,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of radio station <ORGANIZATION> KSLY </ORGANIZATION>. `` The pier is an old pier and soaked with oil from over the years. It's a stubborn fire.'' The crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Point Winslow towed the burning boats away from the pier. The boats, both fishing and pleasure craft, were left burning as firefighters turned their attention to controlling the pier blaze. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the Point <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> also was putting water on the fire, and another cutter, the Point <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, was en route to the scene. Shortly before 8 a.m., the fire appeared to be under control, witnesses said, with <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> craft maneuvering to douse hot spots. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said a Coast Guard Marine Safety crew was en route from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to check for pollution in the coastal area of the town.

 An accountant who was jailed four years for criticizing the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to intercede on behalf of fellow dissidents still in prison. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON> also renewed his call first made a decade ago that the party allow the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people to decide in free elections who should rule them. `` I say what everything thinks,'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday marked by a frankness rarely seen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tightly controlled political atmosphere. `` The people are not satisfied. When the time is ready they will stand up,'' he said. `` I have no plans to organize an uprising. It's a historical necessity. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, 44, helped lead the 1978-79 <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a brief thaw during which authorities tolerated unprecedented calls for multiparty democracy. He and dozens of other dissidents were imprisoned in 1979 as counterrevolutionaries. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, who said he was never given a trial, was released in 1983 after four years of `` education by labor,'' including two years in solitary confinement. He said he was speaking out after nearly a decade of silence in order to mark the movement's anniversary and draw attention to colleagues still in jail. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and international society do not expose the human rights violations of their members ... this will promote evil and do damage to justice and the lofty purpose of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He urged the world community to investigate the conditions of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s jailed dissidents. Human rights groups, he wrote, should ask, `` Are they dressed warmly in prison, and are they bothered by flies in summer? `` What is their nutrition and medical treatment like? Are these people still beaten in prison? Are they required to donate blood even though they suffer from poor nutrition? Are they still given meat and canned food that has gone bad? ... Are they still allowed out just once every month or two months, and given only a minute or two for a trip to the toilet?'' `` Having been in prison, I am familiar with the suffering,'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said in the interview. He said he was held in solitary confinement for two years, and was allowed books only after the first year. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> also issued a statement this week to the foreign media urging foreign businesses to demand <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> improve its human rights policy before investing. The Democracy Wall Movement began with a few pro-democracy posters plastered on a brick wall in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Encouraged by reformist statements by top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, students and workers put hundreds more posters on the wall and similar walls in other cities. Home-printed magazines circulated openly demanding rule by law, multi-party elections and an end to party privileges. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, along with more than a dozen friends, edited a journal called <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, mimeographing hundreds of copies in their homes. By 1979, however, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had consolidated his hold over leftists in the party and cracked down on the democracy movement. More than a dozen of its leaders remain jailed, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said. The best known is <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, who wrote an impassioned plea for democracy as a `` fifth modernization'' to go along with the official program of modernizing agriculture, industry, science and the military. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it had unconfirmed reports <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> had died in prison, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denied it. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said he had no direct information on <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> but believed him to be at a labor camp in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province. Other activists in the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> have remained silent since. Thousands of students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities joined in pro-democracy marches in the winter of 1986-87, but no nationally renowned leaders emerged and the demonstrations subsided under a government crackdown. Since then, the only dissident who has openly criticized Marxism and one-party rule is <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, an astrophysicist who says his fame gives him some protection from government retribution. He was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 for allegedly having helped incite the student protests. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said he also has no plans to form an opposition, but will continue to speak out. `` How can I not speak?'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't be afraid of arrest, if I am I ca n't do anything. If they arrest me, they arrest me.''

 The trees are bare and the slanting sunlight of late autumn does little to ease the chill in <ORGANIZATION> Brookdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaccia </PERSON>'s young friends still congregate at his grave. More than a year after <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was killed at the age of 13 by a drunken, hit-and-run driver, his friends still spend hours at his burial plot, talking, sharing funny stories and gossip, keeping him company. They leave flowers, loose change, pumpkins at Halloween, dolls, chewing gum, wreaths _ anything they think <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> would like. Etched with <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s name on his headstone are a dirt bike and a fishing pole, emblems of his greatest passions. It has become a place where the pain of death can be confronted and, sometimes, eased. `` Before <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> died, if I'd come home late and told my mother I was at the cemetery she'd have been wary,'' said 14-year-old <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` But now if I say it she understands why we're there. It's a place to talk and think about things. It's a peaceful place to talk to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>.'' `` You do n't want anybody to walk by and say, ` Oh, it's a typical grave,''' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who brings his friend toy soldiers and flags. `` We want people to say, ` Wow, that kid must have been real!''' `` They all sit around in front of his headstone and talk to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> about what's going on in their lives. They ask how he's doing up there and what it's like,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaccia </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said sometimes in the summer he lays out and stretches his arms across the grass and feels <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s hand.'' The outpouring of love and allegiance to her son does not surprise Mrs. <PERSON> Scaccia </PERSON>, who has four other children. `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was a kind of special kid. He had a great many friends,'' she said Wednesday. `` He was adventurous and the kids got into the habit of following him around and depending on him to plan out what to do. It was n't unusual for us to wake up at 8 a.m. on summer mornings and have 16 or 17 kids waiting outside for him.'' Public Works Commissioner <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVirgilio </PERSON>, who tends the cemetery, has watched from a distance as small groups of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s friends have gathered `` I have never stopped or interfered, mainly because I know what they are going through,'' <PERSON> DiVirgilio </PERSON> said. `` They've been going down to more or less deal with losing someone as young as that, to deal with death and reality. I've never seen it as anything other than respectful and healthy.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was struck by a car on Oct. 3, 1987, when he and several friends were crossing a highway. Thirty of his friends showed up at the hospital that night to await word. School officials had to call in extra guidance counselors from neighboring schools to help students deal with their grief. The man driving the car turned himself in four days later. He was convicted of motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of alcohol and was sentenced to five to eight years in prison. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFilippo </PERSON>, 14, said he and his friends find it easier to wrestle with <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s death at graveside. `` I think it's a way of keeping him alive,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Dedham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transcript </ORGANIZATION> recently. `` We go there to keep him with us. But we also go to talk. Talking helps me and everyone.'' Teen-agers said they leave sentimental gifts for <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, things that might give him a chuckle or keep him from feeling out of step with the latest fad. `` Everybody knows he's up there. By going down to visit, we're keeping him from feeling left behind or lonely,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, a middle school student whose grandmother's grave is next to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>'s `` This way everyone knows he's still there.'' `` I talk to him and say ` What's going on? How ya doin'? What's going on up there We all miss you,''' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` We start laughing about something and say ` Hey, remember that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>.' `` And I myself, I think he hears us, and I think he laughs. But we ca n't hear him, ya know.''

Financial analysts have said the sale of the power generating and distribution system in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, to be completed by mid-1991, may be worth anywhere from $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion. Two separate companies will be set up in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is not affected. The largest previous sale of shares, in British Gas in 1986, earned the government $ 14.2 billion. The electricity sale is apt to equal the proceeds of all previous sales, including British Petroleum, <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Electricity and the privatization of the English and Welsh water supply are the two main flotations set to go through Parliament in the coming year. `` The proposals in this bill are radical, but they are evolutionary,'' Energy Minister <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said at a news conference introducing the legislation. `` They preserve all that is best in the present system, maintaining security of supply. And they offer the prospect of real competition, the best guarantee of customers' interests, in an industry where there has been no competition for 30 years.'' Competition would be fostered by splitting the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> into two companies: <ORGANIZATION> PowerGen </ORGANIZATION>, which will own 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> CEGB </ORGANIZATION>'s non-nuclear capacity, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which will take over the nuclear plant and remaining non-nuclear capacity. In advance of the bill's introduction, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had charged that privatization would lead to increases of up to 25 percent in electric rates. `` Vague waffle about long-term downward pressure on costs is no consolation for consumers facing immediate and harsh pressure on their living standards,'' Labor's energy spokesman, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, said Wednesday. `` There are no new costs created by privatization. There is no new levy created by privatization,'' <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> asserted Thursday. He added: `` The idea that public ownership and the monopoly are some sort of insurance against price increases is a sick joke.'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> complained the bill introduced Thursday lacked important details. `` The meat will be in the various licenses, regulations and contracts to follow,'' he said. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said he hoped that eventually as many as 20 companies would be competing to generate and sell electricity. Power will be sold to a dozen private supply companies, created from existing regional boards, which would serve homes and industry. The transmission facilities owned by <ORGANIZATION> CEGB </ORGANIZATION> would be transferred to a new company, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, jointly owned by the 12 supply companies. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> declined to say how much the government might gain from a sale. `` It is far too early to say,'' <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said. `` We have n't gotten anywhere near putting a value on the assets. <ORGANIZATION> CEGB </ORGANIZATION> has assets worth $ 50 billion and employs 47,000 people. The regional boards have 81,500 employees. Shares will be sold to foreigners as well as British citizens, <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said. The limit on share ownership has not been decided, but he said limiting any one stockholder to 15 percent of shares had worked well in other privatization plans. Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, the government has raised $ 30.5 billion by selling state-owned companies. The latest to go on sale is <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steel </LOCATION>, whose deadline for share applications expires on Friday.

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> was inaugurated as president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> today despite opposition protests that his government is illegitimate and wo n't make promised economic and political reforms. About 150 of the 564 lawmakers walked out just before <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was inaugurated, while members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> held up signs saying `` Fraud.'' In his inaugural address, the Harvard-educated economist said he was taking power at a time of conflict and change and promised `` nationalist, democratic and popular'' reforms. `` I will be prudent in never risking the destiny of country ... but firm in maintaining order and the constitution,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. `` I will govern for all Mexicans.'' A legislator for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marcela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>, was applauded when she told the congress that the front's candidate, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, had been cheated of victory in the election by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` This is an ill-fated day, because the right of the people to select their rulers is being violated,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>, who spoke before <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' inauguration. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> took power from President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> at a special session of congress after the opposition speeches. The opposition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony if that was not permitted. According to official figures <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won barely more than 50 percent of the presidential vote, while <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won 31 percent and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, had 17 percent. `` I want to be the voice of those who, believing in better times, were once again victims of contempt for their rights,'' said National Action delegate said <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>. The people of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> voted `` for another program radically different from the one applied during the administration that is ending,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is a disciple and exponent of the free market, while leftist <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> called for a bigger government role in the economy and suspension of payments on the nation's debt. On Wednesday night, President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other heads of state attended a private dinner for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> despite protests from <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' opponents. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government invited heads of state to an inaugural for the first time in an effort to make up for their lack of support inside <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He said those who came would be supporting an `` illegitimate government.'' The <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> transition team says the invitations are a courtesy because the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> president has been invited to other inaugurations. With Cabinet appointments announced Wednesday, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> served notice that he intends to push ahead with the economic policies he designed while serving as his predecessor's budget director: encouraging competition and reducing state involvement in the economy in an effort to promote growth. Several key appointees are young, worked with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> under de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and, like <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, have degrees in economics from top-ranked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has said his biggest concern is `` to get <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to grow again,'' and to do that the country needs both new investment and the use of resources that now go abroad as payments on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 102 billion foreign debt. In charge of renegotiating that debt will be <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>, 38, who earned a doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> inherits a country with a lot of problems: the debt, an economy that has been stagnant for six years, an inflation rate of 40 percent, and an electoral system that has lost credibility. The new president will need a quick success to demonstrate his command of the job, and he expects help from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming administration to win a reduction in debt payments. Aside from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, others in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the inauguration were presidents <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was headed by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and included <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, and his Mexican-American wife <PERSON> Columba </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will nominate national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> for promotion to four-star rank and the post of commander-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Forces Command, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced today. The promotion would make the 51-year-old <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, now a lieutenant general with three stars, the fourth black officer to attain four-star rank in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces. One of those four is currently on active duty _ <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>. The promotion requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. In the new post, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would be in charge of all the Army troops in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The command is headquartered at Ft.. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and has traditionally been a major career stepping stone for senior <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commanders `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has the highest respect and affection for General <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and wishes him all success in his <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> career,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in announcing the nomination. He noted that <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` have had a close personal relationship.'' `` He was the general who guided preparations for the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> following the Iran Contra investigation, and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seucirty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> itself,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` General <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> has been a friend and colleague whose advice and counsel have been valued by all members of the White House staff. He is a man of rare quality and distinction,'' the spokesman added. The spokesman said that <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is expected to assume command in April, 1989, when the current commander, Gen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palastra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, retires. Palastra has held the post since June 1986 and is retiring after 35 years of active military service. After leaving the White House Powell plans to visit a number of army units before assuming his command, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s new job includes preparing soldiers for world-wide deployment and to defend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continent. The upcoming promotion was first reported Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and confirmed a short while later by administration officials. The Pentagon later released a short statement announcing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s intent to nominate <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> for the job. Sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the FORSCOM position was one of the few Army four-star posts scheduled to open in the next few months. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser after <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was tapped to replace the retiring <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was called back to government service by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to replace <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> in the wake of the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> immediately recruited <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as his deputy, drawing him away from a major command in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> moved up to the top White House spot after <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s move to the Pentagon. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and received an MBA degree from <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Commissioned in the infantry, he was wounded during both of his two tours in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened bamboo sticks, impaling a foot. In 1977 <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as an assistant to the deputy assistant secretary of defense. While later serving as an assistant to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> received his first star. He went on to become military assistant to <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> before a stint as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and the Purple Heart.

 Former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, charged with conspiring to steal more than $ 100 million from his homeland, writes in a journal to be published this month that he is being unfairly judged. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, whose lawyers claim he's too ill to stand trial or even to travel from his exile home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, writes his defense in the winter issue of <ORGANIZATION> Orbis </ORGANIZATION>, to be distributed Dec. 28 by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> think tank. An advance copy of the article was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> insists in the six-page, 2,500-word essay that he did n't raid the treasury of more than $ 5 billion during the 21 years he led the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> until his ouster in 1986, and he did n't allow friends to siphon off huge sums `` The fact is that none of these charges, which are criminal in character, has been made subject to judicial scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote. `` Many of the so-called <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> cronies are in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> today. They are within the reach of the present administration in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Although presumably possessed of all the evidence necessary to establish their guilt, the Aquino administration has not prosecuted any of these putative malefactors. `` Private property has been seized; moral declamations have been broadcast; but not one single case has been brought before a court of law. With criminals in such abundance, whose guilt is so evident, one might have expected that at least one of them would have had to face prosecution by this time.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote that he has asked the government in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to allow him to return and `` afford me the opportunity to face my accusers -LRB- but -RRB- it has steadfastly refused my demand for a day in court.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' article was in response to one written in the last issue of <ORGANIZATION> Orbis </ORGANIZATION>, distributed in September, by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and currently head of <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowships </ORGANIZATION>. Friend accused <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of wrecking the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> politically and economically through corruption and murder.. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said the `` omnibus charges repeated by Friend -LRB- that -RRB- I am personally responsible for the murder of political opponents, and the massive derogation of human rights in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> merit little further comment'' because his request to return and be subject to his country's courts had been rejected `` To date, the authorities in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> have refused my request, have failed to indict, and display a singular unwillingness to prosecute,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote. Friend, in an answer to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the same <ORGANIZATION> Orbis </ORGANIZATION>, called him an astute lawyer `` who shielded himself with legalisms, many of them contrived.'' He also said 39 civil suits against him in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> seek a total of $ 96.17 billion, and that criminal suits also are pending there. `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> used his regime as a means to preserve and enhance his own political power; as a means to engorge his friends; and as a means to enrich his family and himself _ not by ` peculations' but by systematic parasitic robbery,'' Friend wrote. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who rejected every suggestion he was guilty of anything, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention into <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> affairs that led to his ouster and the election of <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as president backfired. `` The strangest feature of all this is that not only have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests now been placed in serious jeopardy, but all the charges that made my administration a pariah among policy makers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have recently resurfaced as charges against the present regime,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were indicted Oct. 21 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on federal criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' treasury and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and was released on $ 5 million bail. Defense lawyers contend <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too frail to make the 10-hour flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment or trial. A court-appointed physician decided in late November that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is healthy enough to face charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ascended 35 feet aboard a bumpy hydraulic boom on Thursday and placed the crowning ornament atop the National Christmas Tree, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> blue spruce just beyond the back fence of the house she'll move into next month. It was the eighth consecutive year the wife of the vice president has performed that task, and one she apparently does n't want to give up when husband <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s title is shortened. `` It's the only thing I've done more than anyone else,'' she told a guest in a reception line afterwards. `` I love it.'' To a separate guest she said `` I would be offended if someone else did it.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to light the live national tree for his last time Dec. 15, after which a pageant featuring 57 trees, each decorated with ornaments from a different state or territory, will be opened. More than 700,000 people visited the exhibit last year. The tree was transplanted to its spot on the Ellipse, a park betwen the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument, in 1978 after two earlier trees died before taking root. Two classes of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> first-graders applauded and cheered as Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had an animated chat with puppet dinosaurs <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Readasaurus </PERSON> and Pageant Director <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> as they rode the boom basket skyward. `` It was a shakey ride,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippen </PERSON> who was crouched down in the boom box with puppet designer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, `` but everyone maintained their balance and poise.''

 Pressure to reduce deficits can be expected to be a major factor as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration searches for new farm program formulas, Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Thursday. `` You can not avoid having the problems of trade deficit and fiscal deficit intrude heavily on agricultural policy in the new administration,'' the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member told a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. As much as $ 3 billion may have to be cut from farm programs by lawmakers in 1989 to meet targets under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and two economists on a panel with him at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Annual Agricultural Outlook Conference. Lawmakers might be able to negotiate a lesser cut, they said. But they added that the full $ 3 billion could be needed if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes ahead with the across-the-board reductions envisioned by the Gramm-Rudman law. Farm subsidy programs operated by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are running at about $ 13 billion a year, down from $ 26 billion in fiscal 1986. The three panelists at the closing session of the <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> suggested <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might decide to pass a stopgap farm bill and hold off until at least 1991 on any major revision of the array of five-year programs expiring in 1990. The crystal ball-gazing session was attended largely by government officials, agribusiness executives and the news media, and <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> reiterated that he will not be at the helm of the department in the new administration. Numerous possible successors have been mentioned, but thus far no word has come from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his transition team. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said current farm programs, approved in 1985 when agriculture was reeling from plunging crop prices and land values, have proven highly popular and `` I do n't think we would have any changes in farm programs if it were n't for budget pressures.'' `` You've got $ 3 billion to save in some shape or form and it's going to drive changes, I think, in 1989,'' the secretary said All the same, there is no certainty that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will propose extensive changes in the year ahead, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Daft </PERSON>, an agricultural economist and former <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> official. `` You do n't have to come forward with legislation right away,'' he said. He noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change. `` If I were a new administration coming in, I'd say, why rush?'' he said. With farmers largely satisfied, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could well decide to extend the 1985 law for a year or so and tackle any major overhaul later. `` Particularly when you've got eight members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> up for reelection'' in 1990, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON>, a consultant and former <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> business partner also appearing on the panel. `` My guess, as the secretary says, is that it's at least a 50 percent chance'' that stopgap legislation will be approved, <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON> said. As for reducing farm program spending by $ 3 billion, <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON> told the session there are only three ways to do the job. He said one would be to lower target prices _ congressionally set price levels used in calculating income-support payments. Another would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments; and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted.

 Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were broadcasting `` loud and clear'' today as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies kept thousands of jamming transmitters off the air for a second day. `` The only feedback is that we're being heard loud and clear'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinwoll </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> engineering director for the government-sponsored radio services which are based in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leinwoll </PERSON> said jamming continued today of Radio Free Europe broadcasts beamed into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and against <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and West German broadcasts into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, although other services into those countries were now unhindered. Engineers had anticipated that that jamming might also end. <PERSON> Leinwoll </PERSON> called the shutdown `` a momentous event'' but cautioned that the Soviets still have jamming devices in place and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would maintain its anti-jamming equipment. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had pressed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at recent summit meetings to end the jamming. `` We are pleased to see that these efforts have borne fruit,'' he said. Word that the more than 2,000 jamming transmitters in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its Eastern European allies had ceased spread through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Wednesday as shortwave radio operators discovered that the annoying, raspy hum of Soviet interference was no longer heard over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, West German, Israeli or other broadcasts. `` The hum is gone,'' announced <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, which directs the $ 200 million-a-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasting effort based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We think this is a very significant move by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said at a news conference. Future programming aimed at the services' estimated 55 million listeners could now include more music, fewer repeated programs and such new features as call-in talk shows, officials said. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said radio engineers who had developed sophisticated techniques for overriding the jamming were surprised by the development, although there had been some subtle signs of change during a recent visit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcast executives to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in September. He said the action could bring significant savings to the economically hard-pressed Soviets, who officials estimate spend up to $ 1.25 billion a year on jamming. The Soviet government has made no announcement acknowledging that it had sharply trimmed back its jamming activities. Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe are run separately from the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and broadcast solely to the Soviet bloc. Soviet jamming of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> transmissions stopped in 1987 and <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> now has a bureau in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> covers much broader world news and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs than Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty, which have been steadily jammed since they were started in the early 1950s. Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and the 3-year-old Radio Afghanistan are funded by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Radio Liberty is a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation, but <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said all three stations provide accurate and objective coverage. Their native-language broadcasts have more listeners than any other stations in areas where jamming stopped earlier, such as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said. Officials said the continued jamming in some countries could either have been an oversight or another example of the reluctance of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s toughest communist regimes to embrace Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of glasnost or openness. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, said the lifting of jamming apparently was timed to coincide with the meeting next week of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It's another marker in the Soviet march toward trying to be an acceptable citizen of the world community as against the pariah that they have been,'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The Soviet action came so quickly that radio engineers were only becoming aware of it as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a broadcast to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Wednesday morning that radio jamming was one area where progress was still needed with the Soviets. `` The cessation of jamming represents a significant step on the part of the Soviet government toward the free flow of information,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Reports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Baltic republics confirm that <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts are being heard loud and clear,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. Officials said broadcasts now might include more music, which is so badly mangled by jamming that it is rarely played on the stations. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a broadcast board official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he first got word the jamming had stopped in a message left by <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> on his telephone answering machine Tuesday evening. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, jubilant engineers were up late into the night checking the newly cleared broadcasts, verifying that all transmissions in 12 Soviet bloc languages were getting through for the first time in history, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. He said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> he was `` astonished'' to turn on the radio and get its first unobstructed broadcast Wednesday morning.

<TEXT>
 Rescuers searched the ruins of mud-and-straw huts Thursday for survivors of a cyclone that shrieked ashore like `` thousands of demons,'' killing at least 596 people and leaving half a million homeless. Unofficial counts put the number of dead at well over 1,000. More than 1,000 people still were officially reported missing Thursday, nearly 48 hours after the storm raged in from the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> to devastate southern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Officials said strong winds and cloudy skies hampered helicopter search-and-rescue operations. `` It looked like the end of the world, as if thousands of demons were out to kill us,'' said <PERSON> Kazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansoor </PERSON>, a government official in <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION>, 55 miles north of the coast. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghani </PERSON>, a messenger at the <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Janabarta </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I thought the entire town would be blown away. ... The storm felled trees and power supply lines in hundreds and thousands.'' The cyclone struck Tuesday night, whipping up 15-foot tidal waves that submerged low-lying coastal islands lashing the flat mainland with wind gusts of more than 100 mph. It struck while <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> still was recovering from summer floods that took about 1,500 lives and left nearly one-fifth of the 110 million people homeless in this impoverished land, most of which is a vast river delta. Military officials who accompanied President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> on an inspection tour Thursday said at least 496 people drowned, were electrocuted or died when their homes collapsed. Police sources in neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said at least 100 people were killed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. Official tallies in both countries usually are much lower than independent estimates, reflecting bureaucratic delays and difficulty in obtaining accurate information from areas where communications are poor even in normal times. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers said at least 1,000 people were killed in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and Indian news agencies put the count in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> at 200. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> flew to the region and toured it by car rather than helicopter because of the rough weather. Flattened houses and trees, snapped power poles and devastated croplands were everywhere. In <LOCATION> Taltala </LOCATION>, a village of 500 people 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> that lost 13 of its 21 huts, he said: `` Let us brave the cyclone as we did the recent flooding.'' Tuesday's storm covered the greatest area of any recent cyclone in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, but the death toll does not approach that from a 1970 storm that killed at least 300,000. A cyclone in 1985 took 10,000 lives. The 1970 storm spent most of its energy along the coast but this one covered the entire southern half of the country. <PERSON> Mansoor </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> municipal government, said 400,000 people were homeless in the city of 1.5 million. `` There is an acute shortage of food, drinking water and medicine for the injured,'' he said when reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital. `` Pressed rice and molasses were the only food stuff we could so far distribute among the homeless and affected people.'' The storm took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and palm-thatch huts used by fishermen and rice farmers. `` There is no kutcha -LRB- mud and straw -RRB- house standing,'' <PERSON> Mansoor </PERSON> said, but he did not have an estimate of how many had been flattened. About 30 of the country's 64 administrative districts were affected by the cyclone. The worst known damage was along the coast and in the southwest corner next to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Many of the dead and homeless were farmers and fishermen who settled on hundreds of new coastal islands created by silt and sediment dumped into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> by rivers originating in the Himalayas of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Most are narrow sandbars that are partially submerged even by normal tides. Hundreds of such islands, usually less than half a mile long, have been formed since 1985 by the 2 billion tons of silt a year that courses through the river deltas into the bay, according to the government's Water Resources Board.

<HEAD>Berlin Marks 50 Years of Nuclear Fission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fifty years ago, German scientists <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> discovered nuclear fission, a breakthrough that led to the atom bomb and nuclear energy. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> held the first of several events marking the fateful work. The discovery by <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> also was intertwined with the Nazi era. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, a former top aide to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, strongly implied that <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was one of a group of German scientists seeking ways to build an atomic bomb before the Americans beat them to it. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a physicist and chemist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery, worked closely with a Jewish colleague forced into exile by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The December 1938 work at the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemistry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> also represented one of the many feats of the proud German scientific tradition. On Thursday, scientists and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> outlined the impact of <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s discovery at an exhibition of models, photographs and scientific equipment documenting the work `` The development of nuclear physics and its technology has found interest among the public like no other discovery,'' said <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The technology carries implicitly in its use _ both in war and peace _ a threat for mankind,'' <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON> said. `` The well-founded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge to be aware of their responsibilities to society.'' West Germans have been sensitive to some of the end results of <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON>'s discovery: the stationing of nuclear rockets on their soil and the fallout from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident in 1986 in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` That day 50 years ago in <LOCATION> Dahlem </LOCATION> -LRB- the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> district where the discovery took place -RRB- must also be remembered along with the day of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> and the day of Chernobyl,'' <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON> told the news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON> added that the peaceful use of nuclear energy `` leaves open more problems than it solves.'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> found that bombarding the uranium atom with neutrons leads to its splitting. At first, they were unsure of what they had discovered. From her exile in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, Jewish colleague <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> and her partner, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, furnished the theoretical basis showing such a splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain reactions. The experiments took place in the middle of December, with the key test starting Dec. 16, 1938. In the years before his discovery, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> had worked closely with <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON>, who had been forced to emigrate in 1938 as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> stepped up their attacks on the Jews. `` It was unusual at that time to have a man and woman working together when they were n't married,'' said <PERSON> Jost </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmerich </PERSON>, chief organizer of the exhibition. When <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> won the prize, no mention was made of the work by <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> or <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> died in 1968 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. During Thursday's news conference, <PERSON> Lemmerich </PERSON> was asked why the exhibition stops in 1939, without covering the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' scientific research in World War II. `` We stopped there because the history is incomplete,'' he responded. `` We did n't have access to the documents.'' But he hinted another exhibition is possible to show the darker sides of <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s discovery. `` Could n't we, say in five years, have another exhibition about <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>?'' he asked rhetorically. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tagespiegel </ORGANIZATION> newspaper on Nov. 27 said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote in his diary of the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> attack that he had a clear conscience `` that neither during the discovery nor later did I want to work for the use of uranium fission as a war weapon.'' At the time, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and other top German atomic scientists were being detained in a British camp, according to the newspaper. <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s armaments minister and the Third <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>'s top architect, said that in 1942 he had heard of `` a group of scientists who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate whole cities, perhaps throw the island of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> out of the fight.'' He continued that two months later he visited with scientists in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to be briefed on `` atomic research,'' as the Nazi <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> struggled to find a way to win World War II. `` Along with scientists whose names I no longer recall, the subsequent Nobel Prize winners <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisenberg </PERSON> were present,'' <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> wrote in his memoirs, `` Inside the Third Reich.'' <PERSON> Heisenberg </PERSON> told <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> that building such a bomb was possible but it would take at least two years.

 The left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday secured the backing of half the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, enough to prevent a right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> government from coming to power but not enough to seat a government of its own. With the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> split between the left and right blocs, it remained unclear a full month after the elections who will govern for the next four years. In the Nov. 1 ballotting, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had an small edge over <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, with 40 seats to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 39. Each must woo smaller parties to form a majority, and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> planned to do so with the backing of right-wing and Orthodox religious parties. But the defection of an ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ally to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s ranks has thrown a wrench into the works Now Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has the backing of 60 members, limiting the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to 58. The two-man <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is undecided, possibly holding the key to forming the next government in its hands. If Torah Flag throws its support behind <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, the bloc would have a majority for a government, albeit a narrow one. Labor signed an agreement of mutual support with the Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> party Thursday, pulling five new seats into its camp. `` If -LRB- President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> asks <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to form the government, all the cards will change. Everything will be dealt anew,'' said <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, initially asked by <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> to form a government, has a Monday deadline. The deadlock could force rival Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> into compromising on another joint government, such as the one that has ruled <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for four years. The uneasy coalition was deeply divided on matters of war and peace and incapable of taking bold steps to revive the peace process. Labor on Wednesday turned down an offer from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to join a coalition under his leadership. But Labor could go along if <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> offered equal control of the government and a rotation in prime ministers, as was the case during the last government. The latest developments reflect, in part, the enormous influence of the international Jewish community. Jewish leaders from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have lobbied <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> not to go through with a coalition agreement with ultra-Orthodox parties if it involves controversial concessions on religious matters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had three of four Orthodox parties on his side until recently, but their support was contingent on a promise that he back passage of a law narrowing the definition of a Jew. The proposed `` Who is a Jew'' amendment to the Law of Return would deny automatic immigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to Jews not converted by Orthodox rabbis. The majority of Jews in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are Reform and Conservative, and they see the proposed change as a threat to their legitimacy. Labor did not make any clear-cut concessions to Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the agreement signed Thursday, but <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the proposal to amend the conversion law would be presented to the party's central committee. The religious bloc controls 18 seats in the parliament, with small leftist, right-wing and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> parties controlling the others.

 A new survey of high school students has found that many teen-agers are misinformed about AIDS and more than a few are at risk themselves for the deadly disease, a federal agency said Thursday. According to the survey, many high school students mistakenly believe AIDS can be transmitted by mosquito bites, toilets and giving blood. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and local school officials surveyed students in ninth through 12th grades last spring about their knowledge of AIDS and their own personal risks. The surveys were conducted in eight states as well as in seven big-city school systems. Some of the findings were surprising, said Dr. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Kann </PERSON>, a researcher with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. `` They clearly know the primary sources of HIV -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- transmission, but when it does come to things like blood donations ... mosquitoes and public toilets, there are a whole lot of misconceptions,'' she said. Findings did not differ greatly between locations, and misinformation was widespread. For example, more than 70 percent of the students responding in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> believed _ wrongly _ that someone can be infected with AIDS by giving blood. While some people have been infected through receiving blood tranfusions, particularly before the advent of testing blood for exposure to the AIDS virus, contracting AIDS while routinely giving blood is impossible since other people's blood does not come in contact with a blood donor. In another example, more than half the students responding in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> believed _ wrongly _ that AIDS can be contracted by using a public toilet. And more than 70 percent of those responding in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> mistakenly believed that AIDS is transmitted through insect bites. Health officials say toilets and insects are not vehicles of AIDS transmission. On the other hand, at least 84 percent of all the students responding knew that sharing drug needles can spread AIDS, and at least 88 percent knew they could get AIDS through sexual intercourse. Students in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and the states of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were asked about their personal experiences with injectable drugs and sexual intercourse. Drug use was relatively low, ranging from 3 percent of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> students to 6 percent of those in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Sexual intercourse was much more common, with the percentage of students who had ever had sex ranging from 29 percent in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to 76 percent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For male <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> students, 91 percent reported they'd had sex. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> urged education officials to `` implement programs to correct misperceptions about HIV transmission to reduce behaviors resulting in HIV infection.'' The student surveys were not an attempt at a national poll, but were spot surveys in selected cities and states with high incidence of AIDS. The surveys were conducted in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and the states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> cautioned that response rates differed between locations, so direct comparison of the findings from site to site, or attempts to add them into a general total, could be misleading. But in general, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted, AIDS-related `` beliefs, knowledge and behaviors among the adolescents surveyed ... are generally similar.''

 Four sailors have pleaded guilty to hiding an Irish stowaway aboard a destroyer in a trans-Atlantic voyage that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to tighten security aboard ships. An investigation showed <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, could not have hidden aboard the USS Conyngham during a 10-day trip to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> without inside help, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only thing that resulted from the incident was heightened security awareness for ships that are taking visitors aboard overseas,'' he said. Crewmen have been told to keep an eye on visitors to make sure they leave, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, 17, was discovered in a small storage compartment a day before the ship reached port. She was flown back to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> after the ship docked. Seaman Apprentice <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, who authorities said invited Ms. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> aboard ship and falsified a log to show she had left, pleaded guilty at a court-martial Monday to hiding an illegal alien and aiding her entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> was sentenced to the 70 days he had served in the brig. He also received a bad-conduct discharge, which was suspended contingent on his good behavior for 12 months. <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Apprentice </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> was sentenced on similar charges to 30 days in the brig and ordered to forfeit two-thirds of his pay for a month.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Thursday met with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> archbishop who had been punished by the Vatican for permitting homosexual gatherings and for other liberal practices objectionable to the Holy See. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunthausen </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to fulfill the requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years and report on their dioceses.

In 1985, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> removed <PERSON> Hunthausen </PERSON>'s authority in several major areas, after accusing him of being loose in granting marriage annulments and general absolution for sins as well as of allowing homosexuals to gather in church facilities. His authority was restored in 1987 and a coadjutor archbishop, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, was named. While the disciplinary action was in force, an auxiliary bishop, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuerl </PERSON>, was assigned to wield the authority in those areas.

<HEAD>Leading Index Inched Upward in October, But Sluggish Economy Seen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said the Index of Leading Indicators, the government's main gauge of future economic activity, edged up a slight 0.1 percent in October after falling the previous month, signaling some sluggishness in growth by the end of next year. But analysts said the moderation, which would be welcomed by financial markets worried about inflation, is n't evident yet. And they cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the index establishes a consistent pattern. The index now has declined in five of the past 12 months. It dropped a revised 0.3 percent in September, a bit more sharply than the previous estimate of minus 0.1 percent. It also fell in July and May, but rose in June and August. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the index since early 1987 has been underestimating future growth. Nevertheless, he said the economy probably will slow by next spring. Growth, as measured by the gross national product, averaged a 3 percent annual rate through the first nine months of this year, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from late March to early August pushed up interest rates, hoping to curb GNP expansion to a non-inflationary 2 percent to 2.5 percent. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been tightening in order to slow the rate of growth down,'' <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON> said. `` Many times in the past they have overshot and pushed the country into a recession, but this time they'll probably luck out.'' That would put the economy well into the middle of its seventh year of expansion, a peacetime record. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest economic figures `` continue to suggest slower but continued economic growth in the months ahead. ... It looks very good.'' However, at least for October, the latest month available, economic statistics portray stronger growth than desired by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Unemployment is at a 14-year low, use of factory capacity is at an 8 -LCB- - year high and personal income posted the biggest gain in a year In a separate report on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction activity climbed 0.9 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Economists and the markets are now awaiting the release Friday of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s employment survey for an indication about whether October's vigor continued into November. In October, four of nine available leading indicators were pointing to faster growth, while five were pointing to slower growth. The factors pushing the index up, in order of magnitude, were an increase in building permits, a rise in stock prices, a jump in new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial claims for state unemployment insurance. The negative factors, ordered from largest to smallest, were faster deliveries to companies, a sign of slackening demand; a drop in the price of industrial materials; a decline in the inflation-adjusted money supply; a shortening in the length of the average workweek; and a fall in orders for business equipment. The various changes left the index at 193.0 percent of its 1967 base of 100, up only 0.5 percent from October 1987, compared with a 6 percent gain during the previous 12-month period. <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the two strongest positive factors _ building permits and stock prices _ likely will turn negative when the government calculates the November index. `` There's nothing there that signals recession, but there's a lot that signals slower growth,'' he said. Economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row. It also has falsely predicted a recession four times. Preliminary estimates of the index often are revised substantially in later months. For instance, declines were reported initially for five consecutive months _ from September 1987 through January _ but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of the index, the department said Thursday it was dropping two of the indicators: changes in business and consumer credit, and changes in manufacturing and trade inventories. Effective with the report for January, it will add a survey of consumer expectations and changes in unfilled orders to durable goods manufacturers.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today ruled out a pre-trial pardon for Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, saying such a pardon would leave his former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide `` under a shadow of guilt.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his decision to suppress certain evidence in the case was vital to protect `` national security secrets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said earlier today that documents sought by <PERSON> North </PERSON> contain intelligence secrets that can not be divulged. It said it is `` up to the judge'' to decide whether to dismiss the charges against the Marine lieutenant colonel if the classified material is relevant to his defense. During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and special trade representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked to say why he was blocking the use of certain evidence in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. `` The things we're blocking are things that duty requires we block,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. `` These are things that are national security secrets.'' Asked whether this amounted to an attempt to, in effect, sabotage <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, he said, `` No, this is something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.'' Asked if he would be upset if the White House move had the effect of preventing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s prosecution, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` the law must take its course.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who told reporters last May that he thought both North and Rear Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> eventually would be found innocent, was asked if he still believes that. `` Well at this stage, I do n't think I should comment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind,'' he said. `` I think the law has got to take its course.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then was asked whether he was considering a pardon for North. `` From the very beginning, I have said that to consider a pardon ... even if I did that ... would leave them under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives,'' he said. `` I think we have to let the judicial process proceed.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the heads of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, acting under authority of a law giving them power to restrict classified material, notified Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> in July that the material could not be disclosed. He said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, made the unanimous determination. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> did not object to the determination and apparently believes his case can go forward with declassified information that has been provided him. He said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had been briefed on the information and had access to it in classified form. However, he said, `` these secrets which can not be disclosed have been identified ... as material to the defense and it is up to the judge to determine whether it is relevant.'' `` If it is, it is up to him to decide what happens to the various counts of the indictment.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, acting through the independent counsel, has offered to brief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, but has not received a response. He said the information involves `` secrets of the highest order'' involving intelligence `` activities and programs.'' `` We are talking about much more than the identities of countries, the identities of foreign leaders, although that information is also classified in many cases,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that a week and a half ago, when <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> made statements from the bench cautioning the White House that he would have little control over the flow of information once the trial began, possibly in late January, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials concluded that the judge was not aware of the actions they had taken in July. He said White House Counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> wrote a letter to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> during the last week and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed a pleading with the court outlining the administration's position. While <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has the power to say whether or not the trial may proceed on each of the counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the other defendants, the decision of what material may be used as evidence is up to the White House. The White House position was made known as closed hearings began on some of the classified documents in the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> conducted the hearing to consider the former presidential aide's objections to deleting sensitive references from 350 classified documents that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to use as evidence. North objects to virtually all of the proposed deletions, arguing the references to countries, foreign officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents are necessary to defend charges that he conspired to divert more than $ 14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who attended Wednesday's hearing with several associate prosecutors, contends that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide is trying to force authorities to scuttle the case rather than disclose some of the nation's best-kept intelligence secrets. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> earlier had received permission from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to use the 350 documents that contain 1,000 to 2,000 pages of classified material provided the sensitive references are deleted. <PERSON> North </PERSON> also wants permission to disclose 40,000 pages of classified material during the trial. Even if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refuses to allow disclosure of secrets <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> determines are needed by the defense, <PERSON> North </PERSON> could still be prosecuted on charges he made false statemnts to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and conspired to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the Contras. Those charges are less dependent on classified evidence, which <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to use to show he was acting with presidential authority when he covertly helped the Contras raise money and diverted proceeds from the arms-for-hostage deals in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to the rebels. Decisions on classified documents would have a direct impact, however, on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s ability to prosecute <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s co-defendants: former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. They are to be tried separately after <PERSON> North </PERSON>.

 The wrong man spent 11 years in prison for the murder of a police officer, his former accuser said as he recanted his testimony in a dramatic real-life epilogue to the documentary movie `` The Thin Blue Line.'' `` I feel like it's my responsibility to step forward _ to be a man _ and admit my part in it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who at age 16 testified in 1977 that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> killed <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, now a death row inmate in an unrelated killing, was the first witness to testify Wednesday in a state district court hearing in which <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is seeking a new trial. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was convicted of the Nov. 28, 1976, shooting death of <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life in prison. He has maintained his innocence, and `` The Thin Blue Line,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> production released to selected theaters this summer, questioned his conviction. In testimony today, a woman who told the trial judge that it was <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> she saw at the scene of the killing said she did n't understand the judge's question. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> was questioned by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' lawyer about the discrepancy between her testimony and her statement in the movie, when she said she failed to pick <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> out of a lineup. `` Did you lie to the judge?'' asked defense attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> replied, `` I guess I did n't understand the -LRB- judge's -RRB- question.'' But she also testified that filmmaker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> coached her in the movie. `` This man came into my house and told me he was going to make a movie about a police shooting in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. I said I do n't exactly remember how everything went down. He said, ` What the heck? It's just a movie Anything you do n't remember, I'll remember for you,''' Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who was in the courtroom, told reporters that Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> was not coached and that she `` has no credibility whatsoever.'' In his testimony Wednesday, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that he was alone in the car when the officer was killed, contradicting his original story that he and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> were in a car stopped by <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Turko </PERSON>. Although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said his finger was on the trigger of the .22 - caliber gun that killed Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> said based on the testimony, he would determine that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had admitted to committing the crime. `` As far as the court is concerned, he is telling me that he did,'' <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> could make a recommendation to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for a new trial after the hearing, which was expected to last several days. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> quickly got to the heart of the case, however, asking <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, `` Did <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> kill <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> replied, `` No, he did not. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> knew nothing about this offense and was not in the car at the time.'' Dressed in an orange jail suit and wearing handcuffs and shackles, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also denied assertions that he recanted to avoid a reputation among other inmates as a `` snitch.'' `` Someone might come up and stab me in the back tomorrow. So be it,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> why he started making stronger statements to reporters in the past two or three months about <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' innocence compared to what he said in a similar hearing for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in federal court in 1986. `` I felt like I needed to do something to push things forward because evidently what I told them was n't enough,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution when he implicated <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> at the trial. He said then-prosecutor <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> had promised `` to take care of'' other criminal charges pending against him in return for his testimony. After he testified against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, he was not prosecuted in those pending cases and did not have to continue reporting to his probation officer. In initial reports, <PERSON> Turko </PERSON>, the policewoman whose partner was slain, did not give a description of the gunman, but testified Wednesday that she later described him as having bushy hair. She acknowledged that she did not know where that description came from, and she may have gotten it from <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> asked if others in the police department were pushing to solve <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s murder. `` I wanted to see the man accused of killing my partner convicted,'' <PERSON> Turko </PERSON> said. Among spectators in the packed courtroom Wednesday was <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s younger sister, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, who said she wants to see the matter put to rest Ms. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said she believes <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has recanted for attention and to bide time for himself. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said: `` I'm concerned because I want <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to get out of jail. I care deeply about him and his family.''

In 1977, after a landslide victory in the last previous free election, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> ousted him in a coup. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was convicted of complicity in a political murder conspiracy and hanged in 1979. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was killed in plane crash Aug. 17 after the election date had been set.

<HEAD>Government Sues Over Nuclear Power Plant Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday sued <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to cancel a contract for a nuclear plant it says is unsafe and built after bribes were paid to an associate of ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Officials of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company said the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government is anti-nuclear and filed the suit for political reasons. Justice Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> announced the 75-page suit was filed in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, against <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the contractors, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to arbitrate the dispute as provided by the 1976 contract The $ 2.3 billion power plant, on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> peninsula about 60 miles west of the capital across <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, was completed three years ago in the final months of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. Closing the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> plant was one of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s campaign pledges during the 1986 presidential election against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> She charged the plant was unsafe and built on an earthquake fault. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who ousted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in a civilian-backed military uprising in February 1986, ordered the 620-megawatt plant closed before it went into operation. In a statement released Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the government decided to file suit because the contractors `` were not willing to agree to a fair commercial settlement.'' <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not decided whether to suspend interest payments on construction loans pending completion of litigation. The loans cost the debt-strapped government about $ 355,000 a day. A copy of the suit received by the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> stated <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> paid some $ 17.3 million in `` kickbacks'' or commissions to two companies owned by <PERSON> Herminio </PERSON> <PERSON> Disini </PERSON>, who is married to a cousin of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. It also alleged that sub-contracts for the building of the plant went to companies owned by <PERSON> Disini </PERSON>. Officials say they suspect some of the money went to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The suit is aimed at voiding the contract and forcing the giant American company to return at least part of the money the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> paid for the plant. `` The principal objective is to declare that there was bribery in contracting this project,'' <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said of the lawsuit. `` It is not a politically motivated move. It is one that is calculated to obtain release for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which has been victimized by an illegal transaction.'' The Pittsburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has denied impropriety in payments to <PERSON> Disini </PERSON>, saying the compensation complied with Philippine regulations. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> nuclear fuels unit, and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briskman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> deputy general counsel, said <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials have acknowledged during private talks that no matter how safe the plant is, they do n't intend to allow nuclear power production in the country. `` It has nothing to do with safety,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. `` What we're finding here are the results of a political policy that came to life when they were running for office,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said `` They now feel they have a political albatross around their neck and they're trying to blame us.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> will not be a scapegoat,'' he added. Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, who was involved in efforts to seek an out-of-court settlement, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was not named in the suit to avoid complicating cases pending in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against the former president. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, who live in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, were indicted by a federal grand jury in October on racketeering charges. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been named in 35 civil suits in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The results of the November television rating sweeps period indicates that, among the three networks, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> took the worst hit from the summer writers' strike. `` The strike really hurt <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing. `` We did n't have any big events to fill in'' such as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 18-hour miniseries `` War and Remembrance.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also had fewer established half-hour sitcoms than the competition. Those shows got back into production quicker than hour dramas. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was the only one of the three networks to show a rise in ratings this November compared to last November, when it came in third in the sweeps. Its `` Roseanne'' was the highest-rated new series in November. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> tied for second in terms of regular series programming, according to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> numbers. But <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had a three-point lead on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when it came to miniseries and movies. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with five of the top 10 series and the five top-rated movies, handily won the sweeps, one of four months a year when network affiliates' ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating local advertising rates. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average, prime-time rating of 15.4. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 14.0 and CBS 12.0. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. `` The Cosby Show'' was the highest-rated network show with a rating of 26.3, down from the 32.3 the show got in November 1987. In fact, all the top-rated series suffered ratings declines. Because of strike-caused production delays on its regular series, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> rushed to the air with the first part of its more than 30-hour `` War and Remembrance,'' a sequel to `` The Winds of War.'' Except for two two-part movies, `` War and Remembrance'' was the only miniseries of the November sweeps. It ended with a disappointing 18.6 rating and 29 share, but was good enough to save <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> from third place in the sweeps. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will run the remainder of the miniseries next May, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretemeyer </PERSON>. Sweeps programming brought more viewers to their sets. More households used television, but 3 percent fewer sets were tuned to networks. That was an improvement, though, on the season-to-date 6 percent decline in network viewing. And some of the November decline was attributable to low network viewing on election night. One of the most significant numbers was the increase in viewing of independent stations, which have become more aggressive during sweeps periods. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose affiliates are counted as independent stations, experienced a dramatic rise in ratings, an average 5.5 compared to 3.7 a year ago. Part of that increase was because <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> was running new episodes of its most popular programs, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' and `` Married ... With Children'' during the summer when the networks were in repeats Those shows apparently developed a following that stuck with them in the fall when the networks were struggling to get delayed shows on the air. But independent stations also did well by taking over what was previously a network source of programming _ theatrical release movies. The networks have all but abandoned theatrical movies as a source of ratings, <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, independent stations are able to garner competitive ratings by running such films as `` 48 Hours'' and `` The Godfather.'' Pay cable also experienced an increase in viewership during the sweeps. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> was up to an average rating of 8.3, compared to 6.9 a year ago. That was the first increase for <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> in the five years since the networks began analyzing pay cable performance during sweeps. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> predicted that January will be `` critical'' for the networks, because it will be their first chance in the strike-delayed season to recoup regular series viewers. `` We look to the future, not to the past,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Breaks Link Between Computer Systems After `Hacker'
Invades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> severed the electronic links between two of its computer networks early this week after an unknown `` hacker'' illegally gained entry to a contractor's computer, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data or information, but the links between the two were `` temporarily severed ... in order to provide a barrier to protect users,'' the department said in a statement. The connections between the Arpanet network, which links academic and corporate computer centers and which was attacked by a `` virus'' last month, and the so-called Milnet system, which links thousands of military computers, were severed Monday. The Pentagon said the connection was broken after `` an unidentified hacker penetrated a VAX computer belonging to a defense contractor on the night of Nov. 27-28, 1988.'' `` The hacker used a weakness in the end user's computer software. The ` fix' for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is available electronically to users of the software,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Amateur computer users who try to make unauthorized entry into computer systems or networks are known as hackers. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> did not identify the contractor, but a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mitre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, said one of the company's computers had been entered. The connections between Arpanet and Milnet were expected to be restored Thursday. The two networks are connected at seven electronic gateways around the country. `` The contractor's programmers have taken corrective measures to prevent any recurrence,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. Arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that was crippled last month when someone slipped a `` virus'' into the system _ an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. The virus, a self-copying program which can cripple computer operations by soaking up capacity or destroying data, jammed an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide. The virus attack caused at least $ 97 million in damage because of interrupted work and the need to cleanse the computers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities believe the virus program was created by <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, Md. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> last week subpoenaed three people at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was a computer science undergraduate until June. Two Harvard computer experts, graduate student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and computer programmer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suddeth </PERSON>, appeared before the grand jury Wednesday. <PERSON> Suddeth </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> called him in a panic for help in getting out a message to other computer operators after <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> realized what the virus was doing. The third person subpoenaed, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedell </PERSON>, an associate professor of computer science, was excused from testifying. He said he told prosecutors he knew nothing of the allegations of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' involvement with the virus <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has not been subpoenaed to appear before the panel, his lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Journal </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Guidoboni </LOCATION> so far has advised <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> not to talk with anyone about the virus, including <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. But the lawyer said an agreement may soon be reached in which an interview with agents would be arranged.

 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> officials have listed former <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casino executive <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Lefty'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> in the state's `` black book'' of people barred from casinos <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said he was n't surprised by the unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decision, but said he will fight it. Commission Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> ended an eight-hour hearing Wednesday by saying his main concern was <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>'s `` notorious and unsavory'' reputation over the years. During the hearing, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, 59, said politics rather than his reputation created problems for him in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> during the 1970s. `` I know people in the gaming industry today who make me look like a choir boy, frankly,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said another reason for his trouble with authorities over the years was his reputation as an expert bookmaker _ something that was viewed as `` less than desirable.'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> was an executive for <ORGANIZATION> Argent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which ran four <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casinos in the 1970s, before he left <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after an attempt on his life in October 1982. He since has lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1976 that he was unsuitable to work as a key employee with Argent because of alleged organized crime ties. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> challenged the ruling all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but the high court let the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> decision stand.

 Despite an apparent end to the jamming of most Western radio broadcasts, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still is not entitled to have a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` We will be looking for further Soviet movement on other issues,'' department spokesowman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The jamming of American-financed Radio Liberty and two other foreign radio stations ceased Wednesday. `` This is a positive development which, if it becomes permament, will further contribute to the improvement in East-West relations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. But, she said, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> were continuing to jam Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which broadcasts to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We urge those two nations to end this practice, which conflicts with their international obligations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The Soviets long have been eager to hold an international human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. One of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions was an end to jamming Russian-language broadcasts. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said `` the end to jamming enhances the prospects for a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting.'' But the Soviets must make other improvements in human rights and also provide `` credible guarantees'' that the meeting would be open to all Soviet citizens, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration also is demanding that curbs on emigration be eased further. On a related subject, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was concerned with developments in the troubled <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region where the Soviets on Wednesday reported 11 new deaths and there was a rising flood of refugees from ethnic violence. `` We deeply regret the loss of life there,'' she said. `` We hope and expect that Soviet authorities will continue making every effort to protect the lives and welfare of people in the region while seeking a just and peaceful resolution.''

 Construction spending rose 0.9 percent in October, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, with half of the gain coming in single-family homes, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said building activity rose $ 3.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion. Strength was widespread in most categories, but $ 1.9 billion of the gain came in single-family homes, which jumped 1.6 percent to $ 118.5 billion. Construction spending, which rose 0.7 percent in September and 0.2 percent in August, recently has bucked what has been a generally lackluster building trend over the past year. Even with the latest string of increases, building activity advanced only 2.1 percent in the past 12 months. Taking a 1.7 percent rise in construction costs into account, activity advanced a mere 0.4 percent over the period. For October, residential construction was up 1.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 198.9 billion. The gain in single-family home building more than made up for a 1.4 percent decrease in construction of multifamily units, which has been sluggish since federal tax laws were changed effective at the start of last year. `` A large portion of the single-family activity is in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` It's easy to see why when you look where people are moving to. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s population is growing at an annual rate of 400,000, and 300,000 people a year are moving to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects housing activity to taper off because interest rates are rising and because much of the pent-up demand from the early 1980s, when interest rates soared, has been filled. Non-residential construction rose 0.4 percent in October, climbing to an annual rate of $ 91.3 billion. While construction of shopping centers and other commercial projects was off by 8.0 percent, construction of industrial projects jumped 7.9 percent; hotels and motels, 6.9 percent; and office buildings, 3.0 percent. Construction of factories, despite a booming manufacturing sector, has held relatively steady over the past year. Manufacturers have preferred to invest in updated equipment, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` There is some reluctance to build new factories because of skepticism about how long the boom will last,'' he said. Government construction climbed 2.4 percent to an annual rate of $ 80.9 billion, reflecting increased spending for schools, sewers and roads. Highway construction, the largest government category, was up 7.9 percent in October to $ 25.9 billion. `` We're looking at a public highway system put together 25 to 30 years ago. Spending is going to have to stay strong because the darn things are falling apart,'' <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Wins Near Unanimous Approval of Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> won nearly unanimous approval Thursday of a more dynamic political structure from a parliament that voted its traditionally docile form out of existence. In a speech to the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also accepted blame for the lack of explanations that led to a remarkable public debate over the reform he considers crucial to his restructuring effort. Despite criticism from some of the 15 Soviet republics that the reforms make <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> too powerful, only five deputies voted against it. Still, the negative votes were a rarity in the parliament that for years has unanimously approved Kremlin directives. The first `` no'' votes came just more than a month ago. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told deputies that except for an emergency, `` this line-up of the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Supreme </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> is having its final session.'' Elections will be held March 26 for a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will choose from among its members a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet. `` We are creating a new, very authoritative representative body of power that will reflect all national, territorial and social interests of society,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The reform also creates a strong presidency in place of the largely ceremonial post <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed Oct. 1. Earlier in the week, he said that without the political reform, `` The drive for perestroika inevitably will begin to skid.'' He said in a speech Thursday concluding an extraordinary three-day session on his proposals to restructure the government that the revised constitution was temporary, and further changes would respond to demands for expanded power for republic and local governments. But he emphasized the rest of his reforms will be considered by the new lawmakers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also told the deputies that a storm of controversy over the reform package _ including 250,000 letters to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ could have been reduced, and he took the blame. `` We did not care about explaining the essence, the meaning'' of the changes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The center was just following the old practice, thinking, well, they would get used to it.'' `` That is why I reiterate all of us are now learning our lessons. All of us are in a school of democracy, and we should be good pupils in that school,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Newspapers first published the draft language of the complex revisions in 117 articles of the constitution and election law only five weeks ago. The changes were not explained at the time, nor was it clear who wrote them. `` Many elements were not understood right away,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged. The vote on the constitutional changes was 657 in favor, 3 against and 26 abstentions in the Soviet of Nationalities, and 687 in favor, 2 against and 1 abstention in the Soviet of Unions. A companion package providing for multiple-candidate elections was adopted unanimously by both houses. At least three of the negative votes on the constitutional package came from Estonians, who complain that it shifts power from the republics to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Baltic republic had been an object of controversy during the three-day Supreme Soviet session following its `` declaration of sovereignty'' in internal affairs two weeks ago. That action was rejected by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> as unconstitutional. It also establishes the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, with two-thirds of the representatives elected by the public and one-third by organizations including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions. That provision provoked complaints that citizens who are members of certain organizations will be able to vote more than once, and perhaps hold more than one seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The congress will elect the president and the Supreme Soviet, which changes from a part-time body summoned twice a year to ratify the actions of its Presidium into a working legislature meeting eight months a year. It will write laws and may veto the decisions of its presidium and the president. A lone attempt at a revision on the floor Thursday was rejected by a vote of 1,353 to 23. That was an amendment offered by a <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> Jemma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculme </PERSON>, which effectively would have given the republics veto power in the parliament. The leadership altered the reform package overnight Wednesday to incorporate some suggestions from lawmakers, but alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> offered only sketchy information on the changes before the vote was called. It was not clear if lawmakers had copies of the final set of constitutional amendments before they adopted them. The official press did not publish the amendments approved by the Presidium on Saturday on the basis of the five-week public debate, nor did it print the final amendments approved overnight Wednesday, leaving many questions about what the final version contained. The Baltic republics had complained the original draft eliminated their right to secede, and it was not clear whether this week's changes solved that objection

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his wife pleaded innocent Thursday to federal bribery and extortion charges stemming from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption scandal. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 55, his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 48, and a lawyer from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, were indicted last week for an alleged conspiracy to obtain $ 185,000 in cash, interest-free loans and jewelry from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment came just a few days after former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and four others were sentenced to prison for their conviction in a Wedtech-related racketeering trial. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor, grew from a small machine shop into a multimillion-dollar business through a series of no-bid government contracts obtained through a federal minority business program. But federal and state investigations uncovered a web of corruption involving <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> payoffs extending from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The seven-count indictment accused <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democrat, of using his official position to demand and obtain payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a congressman since 1978, is charged with extortion, conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. His wife faces similar charges. As they entered the courthouse, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told reporters: `` I'm innocent and when the moment comes, I'll be exonerated. `` We're innocent and we'll prove it,'' his wife added. The Garcias and <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON>, who was not present at the arraignment, face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of extortion. <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerson </PERSON>, said afterward that his client was in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with `` serious problems involving his throat.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> entered an innocent plea for <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> and released the <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION> without bail. `` I'm a congressman and will continue to be a congressman for the district where I was born and raised,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told reporters before going off with his wife to be fingerprinted and photographed by federal marshals. The case was assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sand, who set a trial date of June 1, 1989.

<TEXT>
 Groups pushing for greater efforts against AIDS urged President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday to help lead the fight and to champion federal anti-discrimination laws to protect victims of the deadly disease. The National Organization Responding to AIDS, a coalition of groups, criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who accepted only some of the recommendations of his presidential commission on AIDS, refusing in particular to embrace its call for anti-discrimination legislation. `` The silence from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and from the executive branch has been overwhelming, and I think all of us are looking to a dramatic change in that regard,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, head of the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference held on World AIDS day. His group is part of the coalition. During the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his support for legislation `` that would make it a crime to discriminate against AIDS patients and those infected with the virus.'' He also said AIDS test results must be kept `` appropriately confidential.'' The coalition issued recommendations for his incoming administration, including a call for greater funding of AIDS research and for reforms in the health care financing system, as well as anti-discrimination legislation and stronger leadership. `` The discussion about AIDS ... must be coming out of the mouth of the president and out of the voice of the executive office,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, chairman of the coalition. Members of the coalition met with the president-elect's transition team on Wednesday to discuss their report, `` A Call for Executive Action,'' and spoke briefly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was visiting his transition offices <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his support for the coalition's efforts, Ms. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. According to the coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had proposed $ 1.9 billion for AIDS research for fiscal 1990 but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has cut the request to $ 1.6 billion. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> referred questions about their budget request to the Office of Management and Budget, where spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said the agency could not confirm any budget figures in the midst of appeals. The coalition `` called on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to amend the budget,'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- the transition team -RRB- made clear that this was not their budget, but they also did not make any commitments as to whether or not they would be putting forward an amendment or making any changes,'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said. The coalition also urged the president-elect to support passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, a bill that would extend specific civil rights protections to all people with disabilities, including those with AIDS and those infected with HIV, the virus believed to cause AIDS. The coalition is comprised of more than 90 groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. It was formed in 1987 to develop `` comprehensive, humane and effective federal AIDS policy.'' As of Nov. 28, AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, had been diagnosed in 79,389 Americans, of whom more than half, or 44,590, had died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 Radio Liberty officials on Thursday rejoiced over an end to 35 years of Kremlin-ordered broadcast jamming as they examined how to take advantage of the newly cleared air waves to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` This is a great challenge for us,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Enders </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON>, director of the U.S.-owned network based in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. `` It's caused tremendous excitement around here, because they -LRB- radio employees -RRB- see an opportunity they've long waited for.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redlich </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> and its sister station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, which beams its signal to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries, said news that the jamming stopped was broadcast to listeners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` This was very much in our news. We gave it good play,'' <PERSON> Redlich </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> office. The end of Soviet jamming against <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> appears to be part of the glasnost, or `` openness,'' policy of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Soviets ceased jamming of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-operated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> service more than a year ago, and some East European countries dropped efforts to block Radio Free Europe broadcasts. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> continue to interrupt RFE service. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the end to jamming of Radio Liberty. `` This is a positive development which, if it becomes permanent, will further contribute to the improvement in East-West relations,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, deputy spokeswoman. She urged <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to end their jamming. The <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government panel set up in 1976 to monitor Soviet human rights, lauded the end to the jamming of German and Israeli radio as well as <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, whose signal was distorted since it went on the air in 1953. `` This demonstrates a new seriousness on the part of the Soviet regime in addressing its citizens' right to the freedom of information,'' said the group, formally known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Western broadcasts have kept Soviets and East Europeans informed on such important historical events as the failed 1956 Hungarian revolt, the 1968 Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON> said a listener from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> on Thursday and expressed astonishment the programming was coming through without the usual interference. `` He had just turned the radio on and could hear us,'' he said. <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON> plans to add more human interest stories to the broadcast. `` We're going to be reaching out for a younger audience and report on topical matters that would interest young people, such as AIDS, drug problems, relations between men and women _ the kind of fare that you would likely find on Western radio,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> plans to set up a call-in system to talk with its Soviet listeners and incorporate more music in its broadcasts. The Polish government this summer said that with new press freedom in parts of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> had no real purpose anymore. But network officials flatly reject those kinds of suggestions and contend their efforts helped pave the way for glasnost. `` The Soviet media have made great strides,'' <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON> said. `` But they are n't always saying everything, and there are a lot of issues they do n't treat at all.'' <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON> also said that only a small minority of urban Soviets see publications like <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News and <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, which have carried some of the most surprising and controversial articles in the age of glasnost. `` There is an enormous black hole in the countryside,'' <PERSON> Wimbush </PERSON> said, noting that Radio Liberty can now reach rural residents. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began using radio waves to try to block <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>'s signals the same day the station opened for business in March 1953, said <PERSON> Redlich </PERSON>. Despite efforts by officials to jam the broadcasts, some Soviet citizens were able to pick up the service on short wave radios. Jamming used to be concentrated on major cities, where most Soviet intellectuals and dissents live. The Soviets this week stopped jamming Russian-language broadcasts by <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION>, a West German broadcasting network. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, commented Thursday that the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> leadership hopes the Soviet end to jamming expresses `` a beginning of unhindered communication between East and West.''

<TEXT>
 A 32-year-old man who had drug and weapons charges against him dropped when a prosecutor heard he had drowned is not dead, and charges against him will be reinstated, officials said. The 9th Circuit Solicitor's office had received word that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> drowned in September in a <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> creek. Assistant Solicitor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said charges of possession of marijuana for distribution and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon were dismissed Nov. 3 because of the belief that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had died. The confusion arose when a 31-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> drowned while shrimping in September. Solicitor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said the mistake occurred because an employee in his office said she knew the man and that his name was listed on court dockets. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he asked the employee to confirm that by checking court files. But the description of both <ORGANIZATION> Wilsons </ORGANIZATION> was similar in year of birth, race and size, and both men had been charged with weapons offenses. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the staff believed that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was the man who drowned and the charges were dismissed. They learned their mistake when <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was stopped by police Nov. 25 and they found three bags of marijuana in his car. `` I never had anything like this happen,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. `` I'm grateful it was caught. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said he will begin asking defense lawyers to supply death certificates when their clients die before coming to trial. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he will attempt to indict <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on the April charges.

 The first World AIDS Day was marked Thursday by a concert in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a march through the streets of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and a speech by a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscan </LOCATION> who has had the deadly disease for six years and says his life was `` made richer'' because of it. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the event, aimed at encouraging people to talk about the virus that infects an estimated 5 million to 10 million people worldwide. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> sent messages to the opening ceremony at the agency's headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, calling for stepped-up efforts against the disease. `` It is the responsibility of each individual to learn about HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- and to treat those infected with HIV with respect and compassion. And it is the responsibility of infected individuals not to infect others,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his message, which was read by singer <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. The agency said 140 nations held special AIDS prevention activities Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s capital, more than 200 young men and women marched through the city center with placards saying, `` We have the power to stop the spread of AIDS.'' In <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, hundreds watched plays and films about the dangers of AIDS. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> held a nationally televised lecture on AIDS and a concert in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to benefit an AIDS foundation and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Groups distributed free condoms at <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, 2,000 scientists called for an end to discrimination against AIDS victims. About 200 posters bearing witness to the suffering of AIDS victims and their loved ones were displayed on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' esplanade of Human Rights at <LOCATION> Trocadero </LOCATION>. `` Thursday night, we will be there for you with your friends,'' one poster read. `` You fought until the end, we tried to help but we lost ... My dear, where are you? We hope is it better than here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> ... Love, Your Mama and Papa.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Times Square zipper flashed news messages about AIDS prevention and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> planted the first bulbs of a `` Hope Garden'' that authorities hope will grow a flower for each person with the disease. A rally was staged in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, a prayer breakfast was held in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and part of a quilt with 8,288 panels _ each stitched with the name of an AIDS victim _ was displayed in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> ceremony, another speaker called World AIDS Day `` the opening paragraph in a new chapter of our worldwide effort to stop AIDS.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, 32, said he has had the disease for six years, during which he says he has traveled to three continents to teach people about AIDS. `` I have gladly had my world turned upside down, and made richer'' through having the disease, he said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. There is no known cure. Officially, 142 countries have reported 129,385 cases of AIDS to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But the agency estimates that the true number is more than twice that, and that 5 million to 10 million people may be infected with the HIV virus. Once infected with the virus, victims have a 50 percent chance of developing AIDS within 10 years. The focus of the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS prevention program is education and information to fight the spread of the virus. It can be transmitted through blood, sexual intercourse or from an infected mother to her unborn or newborn child. People at high risk of infection include those with multiple sex partners and intravenous drug users who share needles. The pope's statement urged `` respect for all individuals'' and said AIDS victims `` meet with my affection and are the subject of my prayers.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, eight letters by people with AIDS were read at a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> ceremony. `` I ca n't tell you my name because my short life of only 20 years would be over very quickly,'' said one letter from an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> college student. `` I sit in classrooms and hear people discuss AIDS and what they think they know is right. Why ca n't I speak up and tell them they ca n't get it from just being in the same room? Why ca n't I tell them the truth?''

 A Lithuanian immigrant who the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claims helped murder Jews during World War II has agreed to surrender his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, but he will not be deported, an official said. Under an agreement signed this week, <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON>, 81, will provide evidence on other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary outfit known as the Lithuanian Shutzmannschaft, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. That information is being used in two cases in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and in the investigations of dozens of other members of <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON>' battalion, he said. In the court agreement, <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON> admitted serving in the fall of 1941 in the battalion, but did not admit taking part in what <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said were the persecutions of thousands of Jews and other unarmed civilians. He also did not admit misrepresenting or concealing facts about his past on his citizenship application. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided to drop its case because of <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON>' age and the length of time it might take for hearings and appeals to be conducted, <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. The agreement does not preclude <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON>' extradition to another country to stand trial for alleged war crimes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> signed the agreement Monday. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had earlier stripped <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON> of his citizenship because he refused to testify about his past, but he was overturned by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> last July and a second deportation hearing was ordered. That hearing was scheduled to begin Dec. 12. <PERSON> Klimavicius </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1949 via <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen five years later.

 Political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was waited upon hand-and-foot by employees who cooked for him, his wife and his dogs, bought his clothes, cleaned his house and performed concerts for him, a federal jury heard Thursday. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON>, a former employee of a LaRouche graphics company, testified at <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s conspiracy trial that she played the violin and sang at his <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, estate when he and his wife `` just wanted to hear some music.'' She also said she cooked for the LaRouches, helped clean the house and even prepared `` very special meals'' featuring boned chicken breasts for the couple's dogs. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s security chief, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> carried no money, and that he would buy suits, underwear, tobacco and even haircuts for his balding boss. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was living this upscale life in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s horse country while LaRouche-controlled organizations were failing to repay more than $ 30 million in loans from individuals. A federal grand jury has charged <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates on trial with him in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> with conspiring to defraud the lenders. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by failing to declare as income the household and personal services he received from his organizations. Ms. <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON>, who stopped working for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> in 1986 but still supports him politically, said that before 1984 <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> staffers were encouraged to attend and perform in cultural events. But she said the program suffered during <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign when a defendant in the case, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, took over fund-raising operations and made staffers work longer hours. Ms. <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON> said that when performers complained, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> replied, `` You have to understand that everything that Will does is under my directions. I make the policy and Will just carries it out.'' She said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> also commented that people in his organization `` had become more stupid.'' <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, who is responsible for safety at <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s house and for his personal security, said he usually acted on his own to make purchases for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and did not discuss them beforehand with his boss. Asked how he would know the size of items such as trousers, <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> said, `` I took an old pair of trousers hanging in the closet to the tailor and told him to make it the same length.'' Under cross-examination from defense lawyers <LOCATION> Magraw </LOCATION> _ testifying under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution _ described <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> as a workaholic who never told his security detail to buy any personal items. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, referring to his purchase of suits for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, said, `` I bought them at odd times when they were on sale.'' `` You were more concerned with his appearance than he was?'' asked <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Certainly more than he was,'' <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> added that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> spent 80 percent of his time at a typewriter or computer keyboard and `` when he got working on a political project he would work for 24 hours straight.'' <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe Mr. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has ever gone on a vacation'' and never takes days off. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization. Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines of $ 3.25 million for LaRouche. The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987. On trial with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> are his chief fund-raiser <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; his legal adviser, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and four fund-raisers: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

 A defense manufacturer is suing ABC News to regain what the company said were stolen documents used for a story on reputed parts overcharges for a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> vehicle. `` We do n't know how they got the documents,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brozowski </PERSON>, spokeswomen for <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based builder of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

<HEAD>Sports Bodies, Black Consumers Boycott White Town</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blacks announced a consumer boycott and a sit-in Thursday to protest reimposed apartheid measures in the industrial town of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, while major businesses and sports bodies threatened sanctions. <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, was the first to resegregate parks and other amenities since the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won control of dozens of municipalities in elections Oct. 26. Several other towns now want to bar blacks from facilities opened to all races in recent years. Blacks, who outnumber <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> whites by nearly 2-1, plan a sit-in Friday at <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a 37-acre park the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last week reserved for whites. `` It will be a white Christmas without the snow,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON>, head of the management committee in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s mixed-race Reiger Park township, said when he announced a black boycott of white-owned businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Derby-Lewis </PERSON> said the party `` is simply applying the laws which exist ... The whites generate this country's economy and the so-called black spending power is nothing more than the by-product of the white economy.'' About 300 <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> whites and a few blacks packed into a church hall Thursday night to plan a campaign against the council. Business and civic leaders distributed petitions denouncing resegregation and seeking a referendum. Several businessmen have signs in their windows that say `` All Races Welcome.'' The <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> council said blacks are welcome to shop _ they just can not own businesses there. Major department stores announced they will not build where renewed segregation threatens business, and 27 businesses signed a petition urging the council to retract. The giant clothing chain <ORGANIZATION> Edgars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> said it has withdrawn from negotiations to build a new store in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> because of the city's questionable economic future `` The fact that the questionable future in this instance is directly a consequence of a bad policy decision needs to be communicated very strongly,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Haupt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Edgars </ORGANIZATION> group general manager <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Beyers </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> retaliated, `` I'm here to fight to survive and I expect all the thunderbolts in hell to rain down on me.'' Cricket, golf, hockey and cycling federations said they will cancel tours, prohibit tournaments and withdraw subsidies and coaching from towns that resegregate. It is illegal under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 29-month state of emergency to call for boycotts or economic sanctions. But the government has made no attempt to stop such measures being used against <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed for 40 years, introduced the major apartheid legislation and segregates some facilities in cities it controls. Yet government officials have joined the chorus of condemnation. They say reimposing stricter apartheid will trigger a black backlash and give the country a bad name at a time when peace negotiations and reprieves for condemned black prisoners have boosted the government's international image. Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> defended apartheid laws Thursday, but said the government would stop the Conservatives. `` It will not be tolerated that we move backwards,'' he said. President <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> reaffirmed his government's commitment to `` the maintenance of own communities for every population group.''

<HEAD>Police Seeking Criminal Charges In 1985 Jumbo Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After three years investigating the worst single-plane crash in history, police on Thursday sought criminal charges against employees of the aircraft maker, airline and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Police said the crash that killed 520 people was caused by professional negligence of 20 people, including four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> employees and four from the transport ministry. They were responsible for aircraft repairs, maintenance and inspection. The Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer Thursday rejected the report and denied Japanese charges it hindered the investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Gunma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> handed results of the probe to the <ORGANIZATION> Maebashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which will decide whether to press charges for negligence, a criminal offense in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Police said they were unable to question the four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees. But they said documents confiscated from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> provided enough evidence to substantiate their involvement. The four reportedly supervised a faulty repair of the aircraft in 1978 but have refused repeated police requests for interviews. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 plowed into a mountain during a flight from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> on Aug. 12, 1985, killing all but four people aboard. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is one of a few countries in which criminal charges are sought against people responsible for airplane accidents, said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>, criminal law professor at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The most important thing in an accident like this is to pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute individuals,'' said <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>. `` But unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under Japanese criminal law corporations can not be charged for wrongdoing.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Air Lines President <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamachi </PERSON> said his company is taking the police report seriously. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, however, rejected it. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> does not believe that criminal acts were committed by anyone and hopes that the district prosecutor's office also will conclude that there was no criminal conduct,'' the company said in a statement. Company sources said it planned to respond to the police inquiry, but was unlikely to allow <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> police to question individual employees. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has disclosed that it performed faulty repairs on the aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 damaged the rear bulkhead, the metal partition that protects the pressurized cabin. The aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978 at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and underwent major repairs, according to <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>. A government report in 1987 concluded that improper repairs accelerated metal fatigue, which caused the bulkhead to burst, blowing off part of the plane's tail fin and sending the jumbo jet out of control. Police said the accident could have been avoided if <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had performed the repairs properly, if <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had checked repairs adequately, and if the transport ministry had inspected the aircraft properly. <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> said about 70 percent of compensation claims have been settled. The company and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> agreed to share compensation for victims' families and the four survivors.

<HEAD>Ag Secretary Unveils 1989 Rice Program With $6.50 Support Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on Thursday unveiled the government's 1989 program for rice farmers with a national average price-support level of $ 6.50 for each 100 pounds. That is down from a national average of $ 6.63 in 1988. Price support loans are paid by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to farmers who post their crops as collateral. Because producers are free to forfeit the crops and keep the cash, the system puts a floor under prices. Farmers must meet program requirements to qualify for federal subsidies. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced a required acreage reduction of 25 percent.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has changed its policy and now sends staff members to monitor conditions in Cambodian refugee camps run by the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman for the mission said Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had feared previously that an embassy presence in the camps, where human rights violations are widespread, would be used for political propaganda, sources reported. The Embassy said camp visits began in September. American policy still is to avoid substantive contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1975-78 and killed hundreds of thousands of people. It now is the largest guerrilla army fighting Vietnamese occupation forces. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> controls four U.N.-aided camps in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> near the Cambodian border housing tens of thousands of refugees. Documented abuses include forced military portering, relocation to dangerous areas, denial of access to medical treatment and at least two executions this year. `` We began these visits solely because of our humanitarian concern for the populations of these camps,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. `` We have made these visits only when representatives of international organizations are present. Our visits are solely to monitor conditions in the camps and are conducted by officers of the embassy's refugee section.'' <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> representatives had made about five visits. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> desk until last December, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` did n't make much of an effort'' before to find out about the camps. `` You did n't think about a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> because you were dealing with a stalemate,'' he said in an interview Thursday. `` As people became more convinced a settlement is possible ... the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> question is very critical. `` It is <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and Thai sovereignty involved. It's a Thai decision. We should encourage the Thais, though, to increasingly press for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are treated in a humanitarian way. `` I think it is in the Thai national interest to avoid a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON> is president of a <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a voluntary agency based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Nov. 25, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> condemned forced relocations of civilians from the Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> camp. International relief officials said about 7,000 refugees were moved from Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Khao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phlu </LOCATION>, a heavily mined, malarial jungle along the frontier, and thousands of others were moved out of O'Trao. Relief officials said the guerrillas apparently planned to use them to populate areas in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from which Vietnamese troops have withdrawn. The new sites have been shelled this month from inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, forcing 3,000-5 ,000 people back to <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luan </LOCATION> A relief official who visited the camp recently said many returned on foot, carrying their belongings in backpacks. `` They were all digging shelters at Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` They were afraid Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> also would come under attack.'' On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio denied relocating anyone by force and said it had not forced refugees to work as porters. It broadcast an `` open letter from a group of refugees'' in <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camps saying they were performing a voluntary patriotic duty to hlp liberate <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. People who escaped say all except elderly people and pregnant women were forced to fight or walk through mined forests carrying rice, weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the front lines inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Those who refused were jailed in harsh conditions, sometimes in underground prisons with little food and their ankles shackled to posts, they said in recent interviews with visiting reporters.

 Soviet authorities have notified at least 42 Jews who had been denied exit permits on grounds of state secrecy that the barrier to emigration is being removed, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry said Thursday. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifter </PERSON> said he heard of the barrier being lifted from Jewish sources after several conversations with Soviet officials. He said he had no official confirmation from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of American-financed Russian language broadcasts. Together, the two steps represent a major improvement in human rights by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before his meeting next week with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Jewish group announced, meanwhile, that 2,334 Soviet Jews had been granted exit permits in November _ the largest monthly total this year. Permits this year total 15,640, making the exodus the biggest since 1980. Among the `` refuseniks'' informed of the change was <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, who has been waiting for more than 17 years for permission to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He had been denied a visa for classified work he performed as an electronics engineer until 1968. <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and first applied for a permit in 1971, was also a strong human rights activist, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strober </PERSON>, public information officer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry. `` He was told his secrecy ban had been lifted and to submit papers to leave the country,'' <PERSON> Strober </PERSON> said. `` He expects to hear in a month.'' The official of the private group, which has lobbied in behalf of Soviet Jews since 1971, said OVIR, the Soviet emigration office, had told `` refusenik circles'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that a total of 120 people would have their secrecy restrictions lifted. <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, chairman of the conference, welcomed `` the lifting of secrecy imposed for many years on former prisoners of conscience and long-term refuseniks. We look forward to the speedy drafting of permission to emigrate to all those whose secrecy has been lifted.'' Also among those notified were <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> physicist who first applied for an exit permit in 1973, and <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> electrical engineer who has been trying to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1978. <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> was arrested in 1981 on charges of malicious hooliganism and served a three-year labor sentence. <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON> was arrested in 1985 on charges of defaming the state and served eight months. <PERSON> Strober </PERSON> said he knew of 42 Soviet Jews who had been notified the restriction was being lifted.

 willing to die to protect him,'' State Police Superintendent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> said of the governor Wednesday. `` When something like this happens, it hurts.'' Two men arrested on burglary charges in <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were found with stolen goods that included jewelry and other items from the mansion. State Police are responsible for guarding the mansion, a mission that for a time on Monday `` was not performed,'' <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> did n't see the intruder, but two or three mansion employees did before he slipped away, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> said. `` It would be an understatement to say that I'm extremely upset about it,'' <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> said. `` It's the type of thing that should n't happen. It's not in keeping with the tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> being very professional.'' The incident came a week after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> revealed that he was on the hit list of prominent people targeted by the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel for assassination. <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> said there's no connection between the intruder and the Colombian drug dealers. Security had been beefed up at the Executive Mansion after an October 1984 break-in, when silverware, a video recorder and other items were stolen while <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and his wife slept upstairs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said it was his understanding that one of the two men arrested this week had been able to get into the mansion Monday and move about freely by identifying himself as a repairman. <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Donalty </PERSON> said he believed the intruder did n't know he'd entered the governor's home at first. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> called the security breach `` disconcerting,'' but said he has his own personal security system. `` I have a 36-inch <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Slugger. No license, no nothing,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, referring to a brand of baseball bat. The governor is a former minor league baseball player.

 Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asked a judge Thursday for a new trial after a jury awarded $ 8.15 million to a woman who said the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused an infection that left her infertile. A new trial should be granted because jurors were prejudiced by information taken into the jury room by the jury foreman and other members of the jury, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON>, attorney for the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company. According to affidavits filed by three jurors, the jury foreman smuggled a newspaper story about the trial into the jury room and read it aloud, defying a court order. Jurors also talked about definitions from a medical dictionary, which also had been forbidden by Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>. `` Never has there been such evidence of extraneous prejudicial influence in any case,'' <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> said. The jury said <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s negligence in testing and its intentional misrepresentations in marketing the Copper-7 led to the plaintiff's sterility But jurors also determined that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> was not negligent in its design or manufacture of the Copper-7. During the trial, attorneys for the plaintiff, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, sought to establish that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew of potential health risks with the Copper-7, but did not adequately disclose those risks to doctors or the public. After hearing arguments, the judge took the case under advisement. It was the first time a jury awarded punitive damages against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for a Copper-7-related illness and it was the largest award. About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> won 14 of the previous 17 cases to be decided. Strain also argued that the jury was coerced into reaching a complete verdict after returning Sept. 9 with an incomplete jury form. Jurors, who had deliberated almost 10 days, answered only seven of the 17 questions and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON>, sitting in for <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, instructed them to return to the jury room to complete the form. The jurors completed the form and returned with the verdict a short time later. Strain said <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> did not have the legal authority to give jury instructions and said she coerced the jury into giving a verdict because she did not offer them the alternative of coming back as a hung jury. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiff, said the jury had already decided the case but inadvertently neglected to fill in 10 of the 17 answer blanks. He said <PERSON> Symchcych </PERSON>'s instructions fell within the `` administerial'' powers of her role as a replacement for <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>. The alleged jury misconduct came to light after jurors were questioned by <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> attorneys following the verdict. Three of the jurors wrote a letter to <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, saying they were ashamed to be associated with a verdict that did not represent their true feelings. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> lawyers also disputed arguments that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> be required to pay the attorney fees of Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. They said the fees of about $ 3 million were `` wildly outreaching.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> should be required to pay the fees under the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Consumers Protection Act. He said his <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> law firm took the case partly as a public service.

<HEAD>Commerce Reports to Reagan on Restricting Oil Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a secret recommendation on whether oil imports should be restricted. Some domestic energy producers organized as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> filed a petition with the department a year ago requesting an investigation of whether imported oil threatens national security. The report to the president is the outcome of the investigation. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has 90 days to decide what to do, which means he could leave the whole question to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The report is secret until the president makes a decision,'' said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. Under provisions of a 1962 law, the president may limit imports of items found to threaten national security. The crude oil price collapse of 1986 devastated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, who had gone all-out to find new oil following the price increases of the 1970s. From 48 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption in 1977, imported crude and refined products fell to 32 percent of consumption in 1985, but rose to 40 percent for all of last year. For the first 10 months of 1988, imports were 41 percent of consumption compared with 39 percent in the same 1987 period. October's imports were 43 percent vs. 41 percent in October 1987. Several government reports have warned that imports could reach 50 percent in the 1990s. `` At this rate we could hit 50 percent by 1990,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Enserch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, Recruit Depot, rejecting the advice of his legal adviser, granted clemency to a female corporal convicted of homosexual conduct, the corps said Thursday. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, in an order signed Wednesday but not released until late Thursday, ordered the one-year prison term handed Cpl. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> reduced to 226 days, said Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, a spokesman. He also ordered her dishonorable discharge upgraded to a bad conduct discharge, the spokesman said, but left untouched the portions of the sentence that reduced her in rank to private and required forfeiture of all pay and allowances. `` Combined with routine credit for good behavior, this effectively means she will be released from the brig on December 15,'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> added. `` I'm obviously extremely happy that Major General <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> saw fit to reduce her time so that she'll be out for Christmas,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Boss </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s defense attorneys. `` But this does not change the fact that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> has had to spend more than five months in prison as punishment for her sexual preferences,'' <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> had been urged by his staff judge advocate at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to deny a defense bid for clemency, even though <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> claimed to have been promised leniency by a prosecutor in exchange for her cooperation with investigators. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> denied the prosecuting attorney in the case had ever made a binding promise to the enlisted woman in soliciting her cooperation with investigators, but promised <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> would review all the arguments in the case. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was convicted at court martial last June and sentenced to a year in prison as part of a wide-ranging investigation of alleged lesbian conduct among <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> instructors. She is serving her sentence in a brig at the <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Marine Base. Last month, in a memorandum dated Nov. 8, the top staff lawyer at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> recommended <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> deny <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> any clemency. Col. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the staff judge advocate, noted briefly in his memo that the prosecutor in <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s case _ Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> _ had recommended a reduction in sentence because of her `` post-trial cooperation'' and because of `` corroboration'' of claims that she had been sexually abused as a child. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> recommended the general `` approve the sentence as adjudged.'' The only explanation <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> offered was a single sentence stating: `` No corrective action based upon trial error or the review procedure is appropriate.'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said Thursday he could not elaborate on <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s reasons for granting clemency despite that recommendation. `` The general took this action after reviewing all the facts and concluding that this sentence modification was in the best interest of good order and discipline in the corps and of Corporal Baum,'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Boss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with investigators after her conviction and spent 14 hours in interrogation. While no written agreement was ever signed, `` she had a clear understanding that in exchange for her cooperation, she would get clemency,'' <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> said. Boss also argued that over and beyond <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s decision to cooperate with investigators, the Marine should be released early from prison in order to seek psychological treatment. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> has testified she was sexually abused by several men while a child and now wants to obtain therapy, the defense attorney said. `` We do not intend to lay the matter to rest after she gets out of prison,'' <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We will continue to appeal the conviction on a variety of grounds.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should investigate allegations from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> workers who say inferior parts may have been used in building the B-1 bomber, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, R-Ohio and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, asked for the probe in letters to <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday refused to block the deportation of five Cubans held in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, clearing the way for the first repatriation of Mariel boat people since a 1987 agreement with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The detainees are scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> airport Friday morning. Announcement of the repatriation agreement sparked uprisings last year at two federal prisons where the Cubans were held. Two of the five detainees did not oppose deportation, and the other three lost their legal fight when <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, without comment, denied their emergency application for a stay of repatriation. The three previously were turned down by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The government had planned to fly the five to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on Thursday, but postponed the flight after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> asked for more time to prepare for their arrival. The five left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the 1980 boatlift from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but were placed in custody in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pending deportation because of their criminal records in this country. They have been imprisoned at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. Some of the 125,000 people in the illegal boatlift were convicts or mentally ill. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said deportation of the five would resume a repatriation program that began in 1984. The five are among 15 <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> inmates designated for return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after reviews by panels the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> set up a year ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge U.W. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> said he will decide by Monday whether to delay the return of the other 10. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as many as 2,500 Marielitos as `` excludable aliens,'' or those convicted of serious crimes in this country. Attorneys for the inmates argue they will be persecuted if they are sent home. The government sent back 201 Cubans several years ago, but <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> halted the repatriations in 1985 before agreeing last year to accept 2,746. That agreement resulted in riots by Cubans in federal prisons at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The detainees later were dispersed, and 114 are at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>. In asking <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> not to order a delay, attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the 13 had received full reviews of their cases. The attorneys accused the Cubans of using delaying tactics. The three who sought court intervention are <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beitia-Socarraz </PERSON>, 28, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary; <PERSON> Onel </PERSON> <PERSON> Calzado-Garlobo </PERSON>, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault charges involving a 13-year-old girl; and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurin-Oliva </PERSON>, 25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery.

 A swift-moving fire destroyed an oil-soaked pier early Thursday, killing one man and burning at least 11 boats and two cars, authorities said.

 Soviet officials informed 45 Jewish refuseniks who have been denied visas on the grounds of state secrecy that barriers to their leaving the country are being dropped, a refusenik spokesman said Thursday. The notification, made in telephone calls from the <ORGANIZATION> OVIR </ORGANIZATION> visa agency Wednesday and Thursday, did not amount to permission to emigrate, but was a signal that officials probably will let many of them leave in the near future. `` They told several people to expect permission in a month,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON>, a spokesman for Jews denied permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON>, a physicist who first applied to emigrate in 1973, and <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, who has been awaiting permission for 17 years, were among those who received telephone calls. <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON> had been denied a visa for classified work he performed as an electronics engineer until 1968. No reason was given, but in the past Soviet officials sometimes let promiment refuseniks go before a major international meeting. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leaves next week on a trip that will take him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Thursday's move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of American-financed Russian language broadcasts. Together, the two steps were seen as representing a major improvement in human rights by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before his meeting next week with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s more liberal policies, most prominent refuseniks were allowed to emigrate in late 1987 and early 1988. The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said 13,039 Jews were allowed to emigrate between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31, 1988. Many lesser-known refuseniks remain behind, and they complain that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> arbitrarily has used access to state secrets as a pretext for keeping them here. <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> said in some cases, refuseniks were told only a month or two ago that their cases could not be reconsidered before the mid or late 1990s. `` And now they called, and said the term had been removed,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a congressional commission set up to oversee implementation of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement on security and cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> welcomed the news from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` This development ... signals what we hope will be a trend toward sustained human rights improvement in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said commission chairman Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., and Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., in a <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strober </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON> was a strong human rights activist. `` He was told his secrecy ban had been lifted and to submit papers to leave the country,'' <PERSON> Strober </PERSON> said. `` He expects to hear in a month.'' <PERSON> Strober </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OVIR </ORGANIZATION> told `` refusenik circles'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that 120 people in all would have their secrecy restrictions lifted, including <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> electrical engineer <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, who has been trying to leave since 1978. The peak of Soviet Jewish emigration was 1979, when 51,330 people were allowed to leave. The number fell to about 1,000 in the mid-1980s when U.S.-Soviet relations deteriorated because of the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It began to climb again in 1986 and 1987. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 11,000 Soviets on a waiting list for interviews at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to see if they are eligible to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a senior diplomat said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Those on the list already have been granted permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The embassy has been inundated by applicants, most of them Armenians. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 66 percent of the 2,400 applications received in October were from Armenians and 26 percent from Soviet Jews. The <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>, an agency in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> helping in resettlement of Soviet Jews, said Thursday that 2,284 Jews were allowed to emigrate to the West in November. It said this year's exodus total of 16,572 is already more than double last year's 8,011 and that the 1988 outflow is certain to be the highest since 1980. Only 1,314 of this year's arrivals at an ICM transit center in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> have gone to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 The most recent surprise inspections of the nation's nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent did n't properly administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene, the government reported Thursday. In a 75-volume guide for consumers, federal officials released grades for each of the 15,000 nursing homes on 32 of the approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once a year in on-site inspections. Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories. But about 2,400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32 categories. The massive report, a compilation of material previously available only on a piece-meal basis through state regulatory agencies, amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for people looking for a nursing home. `` I think this is a landmark achievement, not because it an end to itself but because it will help people pose thoughtful, further questions in seeking out a nursing home,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that oversees <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid. But neither the nursing-home industry nor its severest critics greeted the report with enthusiasm. <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> `` should be embarrassed and ashamed to present these documents so proudly ... At best they provide a teaser to the consumers to try to obtain a copy of the full survey report of the facility.'' Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 9,000-memember <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the major nursing home trade group, called the report unreliable and `` In fact, the guide could be harmful to consumers who use it as a shortcut to selecting a nursing home.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> praised the report as a `` good start'' toward full disclosure of information about nursing home quality. `` We are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable information about the quality of nursing home care out of its computers and made it available to the individuals and families who need it most,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> acknowledged it should not be viewed as a one-stop guide, and conceded that a major shortcoming was that the 32 performance indicators were listed only as having been `` met'' or `` unmet,'' rather than showing the severity of failures. For example, a nursing home that needed 30 nurses on staff to meet patient-nurse ratios and had only 26 would receive the same `` unmet'' citation as if it only had 10 nurses. By law, the most recent and full report has to be available for inspection at each nursing home, giving more detail for what led to `` unmet'' citations. `` This document ... is not the ultimate report on nursing homes across the country but we present national statistics in order to be helpful in interpreting how a given nursing home compares to other nursing homes across the country,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said at a news conference. In addition to showing that 42.8 percent of the nursing homes received an `` unmet'' grade when measured against minimum federal standards for food storage, preparation and distribution, the report found these other `` unmet'' percentages: _ Daily personal hygiene standard for patients, 29.8 percent _ Proper and timely administration of prescribed drugs, 29 percent _ Isolation techniques to prevent spread of infection, 24.7 percent _ Rehabilitative care to promote maximum physicial functioning to prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move freely, 21.6 percent None of the other 27 categories registered an `` unmet'' percentage above 20 percent. At the A-plus end of the scale, the report shows that 99.7 percent meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients; 99.6 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others; 99.5 percent provide emergency medical services as necessary. <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, speaking for the industry, noted the report is based on the judgments of more than 3,000 inspectors, and that the most recent inspections included in the document occurred last summer. Some are 18 months old. `` Consumers must not consider the <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> report a substitute for visiting nursing homes during the slection process,'' said <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>. `` Visting and asking the right questions are essential.'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldbert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>, another trade group, said, `` The report renders high-quality care and substandard care nearly indistinguishable by its failure to separate serious, ongoing problems from minor, one-time infractions.'' But Ms. Holder of the non-profit reform coalition said: `` We think the national statistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''

 Sixty-one senators and eight senators-elect, including Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on Thursday endorsed the decision by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to deny a visa to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The 35 Republicans and 34 Democrats told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in a letter that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was associated with terrorism and has `` no place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Barring <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was entirely justified because <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which, they said, `` engages in terrorism.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has convincing evidence that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> elements have engaged in terrorism against Americans,'' the lawmakers told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` As you rightfully and lawfully concluded, such an individual has no place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he is against a pardon for former aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, but `` duty requires'' his administration to block release of secret documents that may be needed for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial on Iran-Contra charges. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented in response to reporters' questions after his spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said disclosure of documents sought by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers for use in his defense would reveal `` state secrets of the highest order.'' `` We have indicated there are categories of information included in these documents which can not be declassified at any point,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, questioned at the beginning of a meeting on trade issues in the Oval Office, said, `` The things we are blocking are the things that duty requires we block.'' `` These are things that are national security secrets,'' he said. `` This is something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.'' He denied that the move was an attempt to sabotage <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial and said, `` The law must take its course.'' Asked whether he still believed, as he stated earlier this year, that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> will ultimately be found innocent, the president said: `` At this stage, I do n't think I should comment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind.'' When asked whether this meant he would not grant pardons for <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, he replied, `` From the very beginning, I said that to consider a pardon would leave them under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives. I think we have to let the judicial process proceed.'' Last June 27, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to a question on the subject by saying, `` I believe in the innocence of the two men and I would like to see that established once and for all. `` <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has offered a briefing to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who is scheduled to preside over <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, but had not received a response He said it was `` up to the judge'' to decide whether the classified material is relevant to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense and, if it is, whether the indictments against him should be dismissed or he should be tried. `` This information involves sensitive methods and sources and exceedingly sensitive programs which are state secrets of the highest order,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> was advised of the administration position last week when <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> wrote to independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who is prosecuting the case, and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed a pleading with the court. The secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to the diversion _ conspiracy and theft of government property. However, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also could be tried on other charges, including allegations he made false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and conspired to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the Contras. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the decision not to release the documents was made in July by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman said the decision was unanimous. It was passed on to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said did not object to it and indicated he could pursue his case against <PERSON> North </PERSON> on the basis of unclassified material. Later, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys said they wanted to use some of this material in his defense. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> recently cautioned the White House that he would not be able to control the flow of information once <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial started, possibly in late January, and pointed out that the president has legal and constitutional means by which to do so. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he assumed the reference to constitutional means referred to the possibility of a pardon for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, which he said has not been considered. But he said the administration acted by legal means when the administration officials, following the Classified Procedures Act, made their decision in July. He said <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> after officials concluded, from what <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said, that the judge did not know of the July decision. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the decision was not reviewed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` These judgments were made by the security agencies involved and not by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and ... are not political in any fashion,'' he said. `` These state secrets are essential to the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and can not be disclosed in any form.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he was referring both to sensitive information deleted from 350 documents <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> plans to use as evidence and to the 40,000 pages of material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> contends are needed for his defense. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> earlier received administration approval to use the 350 documents as long as sensitive portions were blacked out or deleted. North is trying to persuade <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that the uncensored versions of the documents should be used in any trial. `` There is information in those documents that we know we can not declassify,'' he said. However, he said, `` these secrets which can not be discosed have been identified ... as material to the defense and it is up to the judge to determine whether it is relevant. If it is, it is up to him to decide what happens to the various counts of the indictment.'' Meantime Thursday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> presided for a second day at closed-door hearings on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s objections to deleting sensitive references from classified documents that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to use as evidence. North argues that the references to countries, foreign officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents are necessary to defend charges that he conspired to divert more than $ 14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 A man who said he recorded conversations of advisers to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> _ who said she was a victim of a racist sex attack but refused to cooperate with police _ but then produced only blank tapes has been indicted. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, 26, a self-described surveillance expert from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The indictment closely paralleled a criminal complaint filed against him last summer. The action comes a month after a state grand jury concluded that Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, a black teen-ager from upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had concocted her story of abduction and sexual assault by whites. <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, who has been free on $ 100,000 bond, will be arraigned Dec. 8, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Corley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count, if convicted. There was no telephone listing for McClease in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. His lawyer, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was not in his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office when called for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Wappingers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, touched off a nationwide controversy after claiming she had been abducted and sexually assaulted for several days by up to six white men, including one who flashed a police badge. Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family, however, refused to cooperate with state investigators on the advice of lawyers <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. In June, <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> told federal investigators and television reporters that he had bugged the conversations of Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers and could produce tapes that undermined her story <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> hired him to bug his home as well as <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s home and office. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> has vigorously denied McClease's claims. According to the indictment, <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> claimed he had 10 audio tapes of conversations among <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. But <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> could produce only blank tapes in reply to a grand jury subpoena. He signed an affidavit saying he could not produce the tapes.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told officials in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Thursday to restore order in their neighboring southern republics, where 28 people have been killed in recent ethnic violence. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders of the republics, and deputies to the Supreme Soviet, to a meeting after the national parliament issued an appeal for calm in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> at the end of a three-day session. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said the death toll in the past two weeks had reached 28, which brings to more than 60 the number of people killed since trouble began between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in February over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s population is predominantly ethnic Armenian but the territory does not have a common border with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. It was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and Armenians in the territory want it annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> have refused. In a report on Thursday's meeting, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said: `` It was emphasized that inter-ethnic conflicts, strikes on this basis and anti-social phenomena cause serious damage to the economy and are objectively directed against the democratic processes of renewal.'' Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership, the meeting called for `` the resolute rejection of the attempts to sow discord and enmity on national soil, and for the immediate establishment of close working contacts on settling the situation in the region.'' In a speech to the Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> representative in the troubled region said `` the two republics literally boil,'' and officials are finding it difficult to control the situation. `` Recent developments have shown most forcefuly that many levers are still in the hands of all kinds of clans in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> said, and the official press in both republics `` pour oil on the fire.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Katusev </PERSON>, deputy procurator-general, as saying prosecutors, investigators and other officials were being sent to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> from all parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman identified as <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> gave Pravda the new death toll and said, without explanation, that it included `` victims of circumstances not directly related to the situation.'' He said the deaths were caused by `` provocative incidents and even shooting.'' Authorities have confiscated homemade pistols, sawed-off rifles and explosives from young people in both <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, he said. Ethnic rioting began in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> at the end of February. At least 32 people were killed _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.

 A man who spent five days stranded in the Never Summer Mountains and watched his friend die in his arms said Thursday he `` never really panicked,'' but just concentrated on staying alive. `` Wondering what was going to happen next was the biggest thing,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>, 38, speaking from his hospital bed at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Granby </LOCATION>, where he was listed in good condition. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 66, last Friday embarked on what they expected would be a relaxing afternoon snowmobiling in the woods. They took a wrong turn and their snowmobiles got bogged down in a snow-choked gulch 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. The exertion of trying to climb out of the gulch caused <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> to have a heart attack, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. He died Sunday. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> waded out of the heavily wooded, snow-whipped mountains some 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Wednesday, exhausted and with his face blackened by campfire smoke, but otherwise in surprisingly good condition. `` Once <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> died, I knew that I was on my own,'' he said. `` It's hard when your best friend dies in your arms There was nothing I could do but let him lay where he died.'' Authorities recovered <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' body late Wednesday afternoon and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said Thursday his preliminary examination of <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' body `` indicates exactly what his partner said happened to him.'' He said an autopsy would be completed late Friday. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> suffered his first chest pains Friday, and that he took him down to the gulch and built a fire and makeshift shelter. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said he used gasoline and a sparkplug from the mired snowmobiles to light fires since he had no matches. `` We could n't get back up the way we came down,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. `` We went down a little further, hoping we'd come out on a trail ... but we did n't.'' On Saturday, the men slept a lot and ate the trail mix, salami, cheese, crackers and fruit they had brought with them, <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. On Sunday, they heard searchers' snowmobiles and an airplane and began burning green boughs in an effort to attract rescuers. But blinding snow and whiteout conditions made the smoke signal useless, and <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said he felt `` frustration that we did n't get their attention but elation knowing they were looking for us.'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said the men then decided to strike out on their own but the exertion proved too much for <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` He said, ` Let's go real slow,' but we did n't get more than 15 feet from the camp and he decided he was n't going,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. `` He's gone, but I have hopes of seeing him again,'' said <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>, who was an elder with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witnesses church in Federal Heights. During <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>'s five days in the woods, temperatures were below zero, and freezing winds sent wind-chill factors to minus 30 degrees. The search was called off Tuesday night. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> stayed with his friend's body until Wednesday, hoping rescuers would find him. He said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was the one familiar with the area, and he was lost once <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said he spent his time praying and thinking about the weather, the rescue effort and whether his contact lenses would hold out. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said he began walking about 7 a.m. Wednesday. He ran across snowmobile tracks indicating searchers had been less than two miles from his campfire. At about 2 p.m., he ran into logger <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. `` It felt just grand,'' <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> said Winter `` must have thought I was a ghost. I could n't hardly talk _ I had n't talked in two or three days I was trying to squeak out the words and he just said, ` C'mon around and get in the truck.'''

 Hundreds of police carried out raids Thursday as part of a U.S.-Italian crackdown on a drug ring that brought cocaine to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on banana boats and sold heroin through American pizza parlors, officials said. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the people named in Italian arrest warrants belonged to the <PERSON> Spatola </PERSON>, Gambino and <PERSON> Inzerillo </PERSON> crime families in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. State-run RAI-TV said several top Mafia figures were among those arrested, but gave no names. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statement released Thursday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said drug charges were filed against 208 people _ 75 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 133 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The arrests followed a joint investigation of Italian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. Hundreds of Italian police, some using helicopters and dogs, began the raids overnight in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cosenza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palermo </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> suburb <PERSON> Torretta </PERSON>. They said they 12 people had been arrested by late Thursday, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said 22 people had been taken into custody in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Italian news media said the government also asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extradite eight reputed Mafia members living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Italian authorities said the drug traffickers smuggled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine aboard banana boats to ports in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, then overland to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The cocaine, intended for sale in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was exchanged for heroin that was smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for sale throug pizzerias, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it also discovered cocaine was being sent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a laboratory 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, to be processed and sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal agents made arrests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>.

Italian investigators joined the undercover operation two years ago after the arrest of heroin couriers at airports in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said the women were paid about $ 7,800 for every kilogram _ 2.2 pounds _ of heroin they smuggled from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> inside money belts.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> got more than 100 telegrams of praise for his television debate with the government union chief, and a banner saying `` Bravo, Lech'' was hung on the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus Thursday. Solidarity supporters felt the founder of the outlawed free union won Wednesday night's contest with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, head of the official labor unions, and senior advisers celebrated into the night. The 43-minute debate was <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first appearance on Polish television in five years and his longest ever. He vigorously defended Solidarity's right to exist and said official unions should join it in `` creating freedom.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is a shipyard electrician and led a strike in the turbulent summer of 1980 that gave birth to Solidarity, the first free union in the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities initially recognized Solidarity, but then suppressed and outlawed it after martial law was declared in December 1981. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> complained of a touch of flu during and after debate and returned home to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on the early morning express train. A crowd of supporters greeted him when it pulled in at 10 a.m. Later in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said more than 100 telegrams of congratulation had arrived and the `` Bravo, Lech'' banner flew at the university for most of the day. Official media reported the debate prominently Thursday but avoided comment on who won. Newspapers carried photographs of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on their front pages for the first time in seven years, standing next to <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>. A commentator on Thursday's evening news said: `` Last night's television meeting of <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gathered a record audience This is a new notion in our political culture.

 The ex-girlfriend of a lawyer accused of fatally beating his illegally adopted daughter testified Thursday that she did not seek emergency help for the 6-year-old because she thought her lover had healing powers. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, fighting back sobs, got her first sight of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> since the two were arrested in the November 1987 death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is charged with second-degree murder. Charges against <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> have been dropped. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death gained national attention when it became known that teachers and friends of the family had noticed symptoms of abuse but failed to notify anybody. The state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has since passed the so-called `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> laws'' that make it a crime not to report such abuse. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that she was in the bathroom when <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> handed her the girl's limp body on the night of Nov. 1, 1987, after <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> allegedly beat her. `` You knew <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was not asleep, did n't you?'' asked Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> replied, closing her eyes. Her mouth quivered and she struggled to maintain her composure. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, had answered early questions in a steady, husky voice, but increasingly fought back sobs. While on the stand, she twice looked at <LOCATION> Steinberg </LOCATION> _ once, for a long moment, when she identified a photograph of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, and again when she spoke of her agreement to testify against him. After <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> left their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment to go to dinner, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said, `` I looked at the phone and I started thinking, should I call 911'' or the child's doctor. <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> asked her why she did n't. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> said he would take care of her, he'd get her up when he got back,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> replied. `` I did n't want to show disloyalty or distrust for him, so I did n't call.'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> asked what she expected <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to do. `` I expected him to get <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> up because I thought he was a healer,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified. The child died three days later. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. He has not been charged with beating <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, his live-in companion, who was bruised and had a broken nose when the couple was arrested. In earlier testimony about the night of Nov. 1, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had asked her and the girl whether they had drunk enough water that day. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she had n't, and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, apparently annoyed, took them into the kitchen. `` We went into the kitchen. He took a very hot pepper and cut a small piece for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and cut off a larger piece and gave it to me,'' she said. Asked why he did that, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said, `` It made us want to drink water. It made our mouths hot.'' She said she drank four or five glasses, as did <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. A short time later, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> said to me that her stomach hurt from drinking so much water.'' The girl then asked if she could go to dinner with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told her to go into the bedroom and ask <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, she testified. `` The next thing _ it's all hazy _ he came into the bathroom,'' she said. He was carrying the limp body of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, appearing on the brink of weeping, said she asked, `` What happened?'' According to <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> replied: `` What's the difference what happened? This is your child. Has n't this gone far enough?'' She said she tried various methods to resuscitate the child, moving her arms and pushing on her chest. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> did nothing to help, except to say, `` Relax _ go with her. Stay in harmony with her.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> then left and went to dinner with a friend. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attorney, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said after <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony: `` I think she was interesting, and parts of her testimony were moving, but I do n't think it was damaging. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> added, `` She's not filled in the gaps the district attorney needs filled in to make a case.'' Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> would be allowed to testify about alleged brutality at the hands of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, but not before she testifies about events the night <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was fatally injured. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said a mistrial would result if <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were to testify about alleged beatings and so-called `` uncharged crimes'' _ and then failed to testify about the events of Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, 1987. The prosecution compiled a list of 32 incidents of alleged physical abuse by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the past 10 years. The judge said he would allow the prosecution to ask <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> about five of them. The alleged incidents included two eye injuries, a `` life-threatening'' injury in 1981 that required the removal of her spleen and one attack in which he threw her on the ground. The most recent occurred within weeks of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, when he allegedly beat her with an exercise bar.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> have been invited to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after they leave the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to receive `` a national welcome'' from the Japanese people, officials said Thursday. During a White House visit Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> renewed an invitation to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to visit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after the president steps down in January. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed appreciation and said he hopes to travel in the future but has no firm plans, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity. Leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying he intends to maintain the close personal contact he developed in office with <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the previous and current Japanese prime ministers.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Figure Reported Killed in Plane Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An Israeli who was linked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Iran-Contra affair and who briefed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on arms deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently died in a plane crash while traveling under an assumed name, officials said Thursday. The man was tentatively identified by a passport found on his body as <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisker </PERSON>, a former adviser on counter-terrorism to two Israeli prime ministers, said a statement from the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state attorney general's office. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s former newspaper colleagues in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said Thursday his name was <PERSON> Nisker </PERSON> before he changed it to <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>. They gave his age as 38. The pilot of the Cessna T210 also was killed in the crash Wednesday in western <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state and two people were badly hurt, the Mexican statement said. It said engine failure may have been the cause. Officials and sources in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on a business trip, but would not disclose its nature. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to testimony heard by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional investigators. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s activities included trips to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was deeply involved in the transactions, suggested during congressional testimony that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> link _ diverting funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to Nicaraguan rebels _ was <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s idea. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denied it. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was sought for questioning by Special <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> be granted immunity from prosecution. The state attorney general's statement said <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s passport was issued in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and contained a Mexican visa issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Nov. 25. It said the passenger carrying the passport had registered as <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> for the flight, prompting authorities to pursue their investigations for a positive identification. The plane, belonging to the Aerotaxis of <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION> line, took off from <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon and crashed on a ranch near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, 30 minutes later, the statement said. <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> lies 110 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` According to preliminary reports, the plane crashed ... because of an engine failure, obliging the pilot to try an emergency landing,'' the statement said. It identified the dead pilot as <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, 34, and the injured as <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaonde </PERSON> <PERSON> Amezqua </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Ester </PERSON> <PERSON> Areaga </PERSON>, 23. Cmdr. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, an airport official in <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION>, said the flight plan showed the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> was bound for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Sources in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials were traveling from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the crash site for positive identification of Nir. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was a close associate of <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now foreign minister of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He rose to prominence after <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> became prime minister and named him adviser on counter-terrorism in 1985. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> remained on after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as prime minister in October 1986, and the Iran-Contra affair exploded that November. Israeli reports, however, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> deprived him of any tasks. According to news reports, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> resisted pressure to fire Nir last year, fearing such a move would be interpreted as an admission of wrongdoing in the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> weapons affair. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> resigned this year. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders admitted selling weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but insisted they acted only in cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also denied any knowledge of the Contra connection. The Iran-Contra case rocked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. One major issue was that officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration were secretly selling arms to the revolutionary government of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was criticizing other countries for selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Another issue was the disclosure that funds from the arms sales were diverted to the Contras despite congressional measures that barred military aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who was prime minister from 1984-86, assigned <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> in December 1985 to serve as liaison with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. In that capacity, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> met with North in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, discussing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contras. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> also traveled to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in May 1986 with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to discuss the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in return for the supply of anti-aircraft Hawk missiles. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the program involving selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at a meeting the two men had in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on July 27, 1986. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he does not remember much about the briefing, but his aide <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> also attended the meeting and took notes. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, now co-director of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office, was then the chief of staff for the vice president. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, who lost an eye in a car crash in his youth, was a journalist and military commentator before turning to politics and joining <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' 1984 campaign. He was married and had two children. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> intervened in the Iran-Contra affair in late 1985, squeezing out <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> arms dealers <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimrodi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwimmer </PERSON>. In January 1986, he met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, a national Security adviser, and proposed to renew arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. According to testimony taken by congressional investigators, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> became an important liaison in the arms deals to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and passed himself off on his trips abroad as an American named <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Until October 1986, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> controlled most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to the Iranians through Iranian-born middleman <PERSON> Manucher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON>. North then tried to push <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> to a `` supporting role.'' According to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> constantly insisted on overcharging the Iranians for U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> congratulated government officials Thursday for a `` courageous'' decision to let him speak uncensored on television, and said he hoped it bodes well for future talks. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> got dozens of phone calls and more than 100 congratulatory telegrams after his Wednesday night TV debate with the government union chief, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, Solidarity spokesmen said. A banner saying `` Bravo, Lech'' was hung on the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus Thursday. Supporters felt <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a founder of the outlawed free trade union movement, won the unprecedented debate and senior advisers celebrated into the night. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to foreign and official Polish journalists at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in his home city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> following his triumphant return. `` I do n't know who made the decision -LRB- to allow his appearance on state-controlled TV -RRB-, but I have to admit that this person was courageous,''. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, according to a TV videotape recording of his remarks by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Knowing what I represent, this is a heroic decision and can give cause for hope -LRB- for future talks. -RRB-. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, praised TV producers for an accurate program. `` I can say the television was honest and all right. This time television behaved as it should be in the world, and I am nicely surprised,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, wearing a red turtle neck sweater he said he needed to protect a sore throat. He appeared in an ebullient mood and briefly put on a boxing glove offered him by a Polish reporter. The 43-minute debate was <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first appearance on Polish TV in five years and his longest appearance ever. He vigorously defended Solidarity's right to exist and said the official trade unions should join Solidarity in `` creating freedom.'' Official mass media on Thursday prominently reported the debate, but avoided much discussion of its content or any comment on who won. However, Polish newspapers for apparently the first time in seven years ran photographs of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on their front pages, standing next to <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> at the TV studio. `` Last night's television meeting of <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gathered a record audience. ...

 Police dogs found a fifth body Thursday, apparently that of a woman, in a search along two highways in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that was prompted by the discovery of four women's bodies. The clothed and decomposed remains were found around 3:30 p.m. near <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>, off of Route 140, less than three miles from the site where the first body was discovered in July, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office. <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said authorities would continue the search. He said the officer who found the body told him that it was appeared to be a woman. No other details were available. District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has expressed fears that the deaths are related and linked to the disappearance of several women from the <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, known by police as a center for local drug trading and prostitution. `` There are things that are not coincidence, that are in common,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said after the fifth body was found. Authorities said the bodies of three women were found near the same Interstate 195 exit in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, and a fourth body was discovered near <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>, about 10 miles away. State Trooper <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsalves </PERSON> said one of the victims was strangled and the cause of death in the other four cases is not known. He and several other authorities discouraged early reports of a possible serial killer. But there were strong similarities in the cases, the county prosecutor said. `` I feel pretty confident they are connected somehow,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. Two bodies were discovered in July, one in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>. Last month, a third body was discovered near the Dartmouth interstate exit. A search for more bodies began Monday when <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> state police provided two dogs trained to search for bodies. On Tuesday, the dogs found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman along the interstate in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. None of the women has been positively identified. On Wednesday, a dog from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state police joined the search. Authorities are checking dental records of five women reported missing in recent months to see if they match any of the bodies. Three of the missing women were last seen or lived near or frequented the Weld Square area. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giammalvo </PERSON>, whose family has run a grocery store on Weld Square since 1922, said he had n't seen much change since the first body was found. `` They -LRB- prostitutes -RRB- come in and out of here all the time. It's business as usual,'' he said. After three days searching the <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> area, the searchers moved to along Route 140 in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION>, near where the body was found in July. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said he believes one person may have killed the three women whose bodies were found in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, and that the person was familiar with the area. `` I personally do n't believe it could have been someone traveling through,'' he said. `` It looks like it was someone who was more local, someone who knew the area, someone who felt confident enough that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave.''

 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> rejected on Thursday an Australian ultimatum to turn over a consulate guard accused of shooting and wounding a demonstrator in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, an official report said. The diplomatic wrangle arose after a 16-year-old was shot in the throat Sunday during a demonstration by about 1,500 Croatians outside the Yugoslav consulate. Consulate officials refused to surrender the guard accused of shooting the boy. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said Thursday the consulate will be closed down and its staff expelled if he was not turned over by Friday evening. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> summoned Australian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> on Thursday and asked <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to re-examine its ultimatum, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. If not, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will react `` with adequate measures,'' <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Tanjug </PERSON> did not say what these would be. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> defended the guard's action, saying he `` had no choice but, shooting into the air, to warn Australian authorities... lives and security of workers in the consulate and their families were directly imperiled. Yugoslav officials said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> failed to protect the consulate from the protesters, whom they called `` fascist pro-Utasha emigres.'' The Ustashas were Croatian fascists who teamed with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in opposing <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> resistance forces during World War II. Croatian extremists have been accused of killing at least two Yugoslav diplomats abroad and wounding others in attacks over the past 20 years.

Most were killed by <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> security forces, but 13 troops also died. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> expects Australian officials `` to identify and punish terrorist attackers.'' However, Australian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> says his government has enough evidence to prosecute the guard.

 A woman who testified against an accused police killer at his 1977 trial told a judge Thursday that a filmmaker coached her to make inaccurate statements in a documentary which questions the man's conviction. The filmmaker said the woman has `` no credibility.'' <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> testified Thursday in a hearing at which <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is asking a judge to recommend a retrial of his murder case. After hearing evidence, state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> will tell the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> whether he believes <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> deserves a new trial. Much of the material being presented in the retrial request was in the documentary `` The Thin Blue Line.'' `` This man came into my house and told me he was going to make a movie about a police shooting in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> said of filmmaker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` I said I do n't exactly remember how everything went down. He said ` What the heck? It's just a movie. Anything you do n't remember, I'll remember for you,''' Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> said. In the trial following the 1976 murder of policeman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> told the judge she identified <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in a lineup. The documentary, though, quoting investigators and interviewing Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON>, notes that she chose someone else in the lineup. `` Did you lie to the judge -LRB- during the murder trial -RRB-?'' defense attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> asked her Thursday. `` I guess I did n't understand the -LRB- judge's -RRB- question,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, during a recess in Thursday's testimony, told reporters that Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON>'s inability to identify <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in the police lineup would throw into doubt her identification of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> at his trial and her testimony. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> `` has no credibility whatsoever'' and said unedited filmed interviews show she was interviewed `` without coaching and without influence to say anything whatsoever.'' Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> also said she believed a lack of evidence, not any agreement with attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in the murder trial, led to dismissal of a robbery charge against her daughter. The charge was dropped five days after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was sentenced for the police shooting, <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON> said her daughter's case `` has nothing to do with this case. I do n't ask for favors.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danish </PERSON>, who represented Ms. <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON>'s daughter in the robbery case, acknowledged under questioning from <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> that, in his opinion, there was enough evidence for the robbery case to go to the jury and that he has seen people sentenced to prison with less evidence. `` I do n't believe <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> ... ever came out and told me she had a quid-pro-quo arrangement with <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> ... I can say she gave the impression this case I was working on was nothing to worry about,'' Danish said. On Wednesday, the first day of the hearing, prisoner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recanted his 1977 testimony that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was the only known witness to the slaying. Although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said his finger was on the trigger of the .22 - caliber gun that killed <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a death row inmate in connection with an unrelated killing, said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> `` knew nothing about this offense and was not in the car at the time -LRB- Wood was shot -RRB-.''

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ended a special session Thursday, ignoring a midnight deadline to enact legislation on an agreement for the state to buy and dismantle the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant should not be allowed to open because <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could n't be safely evacuated in the event of a serious nuclear accident. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents were concerned that their electrical rates might soar under the state plan. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members headed home before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s adjournment, apparently convinced that the upper chamber would refuse to deal with the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> agreement The leader of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Speaker <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said his members would n't approve any <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> bill that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had n't agreed to. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would n't back a <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> measure because nine senators from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, all Republicans, felt the agreement as written would be too generous to <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and raise rates for the utility's customers The takeover of the completed power plant was approved by stockholders of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lighting </LOCATION>, better known as <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, and the utility's board set a deadline for state approval in the middle of November. When that date passed, it was extended to Dec. 1. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said the utility's board of directors had called a meeting for Friday in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> to discuss `` our future course regarding the settlement.'' He would not speculate what options <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> might consider. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had said that if the deal died, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> could get an operating license from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as early as Dec. 12. The deal, worked out by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s aides in June, called for the state to buy the $ 5.3 billion power plant for $ 1 and dismantle it. In return, the utility would get guaranteed rate hikes over the next decade totaling more than 60 percent. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> customers would find their rates going up by 100 percent over the next decade if the agreement was n't approved and the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant went into operation. The state, through the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, would build non-nuclear power plants to provide <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> with the electricity it would lose without <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>, the deal stipulated.

 The wife of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mayor and another woman were killed Thursday when their one-car tourist train derailed high in the Andes and tumbled down an embankment, officials said. Eight people, including <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, were injured. Jersey City Councilman <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, who initially reported the derailment to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters he suffered only minor bruises. Police said they were investigating reports that the tracks may have been sabotaged in connection with a general labor strike that was affecting the nation Thursday. They said steel rods were found near the derailment site and might have been purposely placed on the tracks to cause an accident. The single-car train, a bus outfitted to travel over rails, derailed about six miles outside <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, a tourist mecca 355 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, police said. They said the vehicle derailed, traveled about 30 feet, went off a cliff and plunged 250 feet before coming to a stop. Killed were <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, about 60, and <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, 58, wife of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, local police said. Dr. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Cuzco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, who is about 65, was in stable condition with multiple bruises. He said <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> was in serious condition suffering from multiple fractures and internal bleeding. The conditions of the train driver and three policemen aboard were not immediately known. The train had left <ORGANIZATION> Cuzco </ORGANIZATION> 45 minutes earlier on a special sightseeing trip to the ancient <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> citadel of <LOCATION> Machu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picchu </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, police said. Police said some of the passengers apparently were able to escape from the vehicle before it went over the cliff. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said preliminary reports indicated Mrs. <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> died of skull fractures. An autopsy was scheduled for Friday. The Cuccis arrived in <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> on Thursday morning and planned to participate in a sister city celebration honoring <LOCATION> Jersy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>. A larger tourist train with several cars daily carries dozens of tourists, many from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Machu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picchu </LOCATION>. This was the first report of a serious accident involving the route since a bomb exploded on it in June 1986. Eight people were killed, including an American.

 Thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> children streamed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> elementary schools Thursday after the army lifted an order that shut down classes for most of 10 months. There were no reports of violence at the 612 private, state and U.N.-run schools attended by about 230,000 first-through-sixth graders. But elsewhere Thursday, a Palestinian teen-ager was killed and 15 Arabs were wounded when troops opened fire at rock-throwing demonstrators in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Jewish settlement of <PERSON> Pisgat </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> driver was attacked with stones, lost control of his car and crashed into an electricity pole, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. He was reported to suffer only slight injuries. The 17-year-old Palestinian was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kifin </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, when soldiers searching for protesters opened fire after they were attacked with stones and a fire bomb, an army statement said. The latest death raised to at least 317 the number of Palestinians killed since they launched their uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis also have died. Among the wounded was a 10-year-old boy from <LOCATION> Deir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balah </LOCATION> refugee camp south of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the hospital officials, who demanded anonymity. They said the boy, identified as <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, was in critical condition with a bullet wound in his chest and was transferred to <LOCATION> Barzilai </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for further treatment. The army confirmed that four Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the central market of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and said it was checking the other reports of wounded. The start of elementary school classes was the first step in the army's three-stage opening of 1,194 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools, closed for all but a few weeks since Feb. 3. Junior high schools will open Dec. 11 and high schools Dec. 18. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military administration, said there was no guarantee the schools would remain open. `` We have made the opening conditional on the schools being used for learning and not to create demonstrations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Erez </ORGANIZATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have no guarantees that everything will go smoothly.'' The army closed the schools in February after charging they were a breeding ground for anti-Israeli demonstrations. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> universities and colleges are to remain closed indefinitely. The 365 schools attended by 175,000 students in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been open, although there have been sporadic closures. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, nine miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, children greeted one another happily in the schoolyard of the Quaker-run <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> as it opened at 7:30 a.m. `` They were excited, perhaps more about meeting each other than about being back in class,'' principal <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said. Most fourth graders in an English class at the <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said they were glad to be back in school. `` I missed school because I did n't see my friends. I studied at home, but it was n't the same,'' said 9-year-old <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapenga </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Boshnah </PERSON>, also 9, said he had no difficulty getting up for school Thursday even though classes started half an hour earlier to compensate for school ending at noon instead of 1 p.m., in compliance with PLO-issued strike orders. `` At home, I played a lot and watched TV. But I do n't miss it. It got boring,'' <PERSON> Boshnah </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Awwad </PERSON>, 11, disagreed, glancing disparagingly at his sixth-grade science text. `` I'd rather be throwing rocks at the Jews,'' said <PERSON> Awwad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said school attendance Thursday was about 150 students, down considerably from last year's 200 elementary pupils. `` In the upper grades, the loss will be even greater,'' added <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON>. He said this year's class of graduating seniors would number just seven, compared to 33 before the school closure. The sharp drop in enrollment was due to Arab-American students leaving for schools in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and hundreds of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> students enrolling in schools in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> during the prolonged closure, <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said. Tourism Ministry officials, meanwhile, announced that religious Christmas celebrations would take place in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> as scheduled. The statement came after Palestinian municipal officials said earlier this week they were canceling city-run Christmas activities in solidarity with the Palestinian uprising. The Palestinian decision means there wo n't be an annual reception for Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> dignitaries, a Christmas eve Boy Scout parade or decorations in city streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> plans to stage its annual international choir festival and other events.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> imposed tighter guidelines for cockpit conduct Thursday and a federal panel probing the crash of Flight 1141 learned of occasional lapses in communication and procedure on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight decks. Delta officials said they had planned to issue the new guidelines before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began its public hearing this week into the Aug. 31 crash of the flight upon takeoff from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Fourteen of the 108 people on the plane died. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittman </PERSON>, who led a team that conducted a special safety audit of the Atlanta-based carrier in 1987, told the panel Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s policy a year ago was to give pilots `` maximum discretion'' in control of the cockpit. `` We were surprised at some of the things we found,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dittman </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s crew are -LRB- on the whole -RRB- either unprofessional or purposely negligent,'' the report said. `` Rather, it was observed that crew members are frequently acting as individuals rather than as members of smoothly running teams.'' The report cited some <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> captains' passive leadership, under which fellow flight officers often `` proceeded on the assumption that they knew what the captain wanted,'' and led to misunderstandings, oversights and errors. Ms. <PERSON> Dittman </PERSON> also told the board that a followup survey in November showed <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> was making `` great strides'' in tightening its regulations. The revised regulations will require crew members to call out items that have been cleared on a checklist. Earlier this week at the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Flight 1141 Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> testified he had used hand gestures to signal his progress through the checklist. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a flight instructor, told the panel Thursday that one major change on crew members' flight checklists will be to look at the wing flaps twice. `` We started deploying them -LRB- the flaps -RRB- as soon as we go so the public can see them and say they're down,'' he said. The wing flaps have been the focus of much of the panel's investigation Investigators have been puzzled that the plane's flap handle was found up, the retracted position, although some of the plane's flaps and slats were extended. A switch for a system that would have warned the pilots of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 that the jet's wing flaps were improperly set for takeoff had corroded, a veteran engineer told federal investigators Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials say the hearing is only for fact-gathering and that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public in six months. All three crew members agreed before the board that, to the best of their recollection, they made all necessary preflight preparations, including setting the flaps, although they may have bent several <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> regulations. One of their admitted technical violations was allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit during a long delay before takeoff.

 <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a defense manufacturer, knowingly shipped defective Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which accepted them even though it was warned about the problems, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday.

By last December, <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> had delivered about 3,100 Bradleys at a cost of $ 10 billion. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says the cost of the Bradley program has reached $ 11.3 billion. `` There was never a vehicle that left here that did n't have multiple defects on it,'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringstaff </PERSON>, one of the government inspectors who worked on the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ringstaff </PERSON>, asked by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> if the defects could have been dangerous to soldiers riding in the vehicle, said, `` Of course, it could.'' After <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> shipped the Bradleys to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a few were supposed to be tested. But the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> were not enthusiastic about performing the tests, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s key <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> tester at the time, told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` I had a three-star general tell me that we do n't want to test because we know it may blow up and then that will just cause a stink and so we really do n't want that to happen,'' he said. According to an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> engineer, workers installed flawed metal armor on certain Bradleys and in some cases the layered metal delaminated, the network reported. `` That is an extremely dangerous condition,'' he said. In another memo obtained by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, government inspectors found <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> had removed parts from <LOCATION> Bradleys </LOCATION> after they had passed inspection and then placed those parts on other Bradleys still to be inspected. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> on camera. Although <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> allegedly were unenthusiastic about testing the vehicle, eventually it was tested and flaws were uncovered. Last December, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent `` more survivable'' in battle. But <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reports that many flawed vehicles still remain in the field. It also reported that former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s senior staff now work for <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>. It said Gen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff at the time the first Bradleys came off the assembly line, took a position on <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors three months after he retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in June 1983. In 1986, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> was paid about $ 128,000 by <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported. He declined to talk to the network. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, who oversaw production of the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> plant, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and a few days later he went to work for the company, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported. He also declined to talk to the network. On Oct. 20, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> aired the story that quoted unidentified former <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> employees who accused the company of overcharging the government for spare parts on the vehicle. `` We do n't know how they got the documents,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brozowski </PERSON>, spokeswomen for <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>. An in-house investigation of the television story `` turned up the fact that the documents were missing from our files,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> also said it has told the government's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> it will cooperate with any investigation of prices charged on the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> parts, according to the statement.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed departing Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Thursday night as an indispensable conservative ally who fired `` solid gold bullets'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax-cut programs In remarks at a testimonial dinner for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman who is leaving office in January, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` one of the deputies'' who helped him institute supply-side economics when he came to power in 1981. He called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> an unstinting fighter for conservative values, and said President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will need only to `` sound the trumpet'' when he needs support and `` the great army of idealists and activists we have counted on will be ready to charge.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was a principal sponsor of the so-called Kemp-Roth bill to cut marginal tax rates by 30 percent, which was introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. He also said that `` our ideas were relegated to the fringe'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until the landmark legislation cutting tax rates was passed in 1981. `` When you talk about <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, one word comes to mind: the cause,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Wherever he is, he will fight for that cause, he will work for that cause, and what unites every single person in this room is our shared commitment to that cause.'' `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> is fond of saying that this administration gave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back to its future,'' the president said. `` If I can return the compliment, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, I would just like to say that your ideas helped fuel us to go further into the future than we ever dreamed possible.'' `` He helped to settle a tough frontier _ the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ loading his six-gun with solid gold bullets,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the former treasury secretary who is now Secretary of State-designate for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, told the dinner, `` What some of us thought might be ` voodoo economics' really turned out to be ` can-do economics.''' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager in 1980 when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged that the tax cuts favored by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> amounted to `` voodoo economics. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will head a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> after he leaves office.

 Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> arrived Thursday as his nation's first high-level envoy to the Soviet capital in 31 years. He will be meeting Soviet officials to seek agreement on the conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and prepare for a 1989 summit. The summit would be the first since 1959 when <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met Chinese leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-Tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit is the first by a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister since the visit of <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> in 1957. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> greeted him at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sheremetyevo </ORGANIZATION> 2 Airport. They are to conduct two days of talks, and the Chinese official said he also expected to meet with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as two great neighboring countries, must live in peace and neighborly relations,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said in an arrival statement distributed by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are glad that in recent years Chinese-Soviet relations gradually are improving,'' he was quoted as saying. Relations between the two communist powers soured in the early 1960s in a struggle over the direction of world communism. They reached a low point in 1969, when each side sent at least 1 million soldiers to the border and fought a short frontier war. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made several recent overtures to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, ordering a pullout of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, reducing Soviet troops on the Chinese border, and agreeing to direct talks on the Vietnamese presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In late October, officials announced that negotiators had reached agreement settling most Soviet-Chinese differences over the eastern part of their common boundary. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to use its influence to force Vietnamese soldiers out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where they have been fighting Chinese-backed rebels for the past decade. The dispute has been the main stumbling block to a Soviet-Chinese summit. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> spent much of their time in their first meeting Thursday dicussing that dispute. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> indicated the summit was a virtual certainty, regardless of progress on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the summit because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is 84 years old and rarely travels abroad. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told reporters earlier that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would make a return visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Three bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> early Friday a few hours before the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit this weekend on the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION>, police reported. No injures were reported. One blast was at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> office of the EEC.

All three offices were empty and nobody was hurt in the explosions, said a police spokesman who was not identified in keeping with Greek practice. No details were immediately available about the extent of damage. The spokesman said an anonymous caller telephoned two <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> left-wing newspapers with a warning 10 minutes before the blasts, which occurred between 1:15 a.m. and 1:35 a.m. No group immediately claimed responsibility. But the spokesman said police believe a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> carried out the bombings. ELA, as the leftist group is known, has claimed responsibility for more than 100 explosions since 1975, many at the premises of Greek public services.

<HEAD>Murder Trial For Three Polygamist Clan Members To Begin Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COALVILLE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for three polygamist clan members charged with killing a state law officer say their case will center on psychological stress from police floodlights and loudspeakers. An eight-member jury and two alternates were empaneled Thursday and opening arguments were to begin Friday in the trial of clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, and brother-in-law <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22. All are charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 28 death of Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. House was killed during a brief shootout that ended a standoff between the clan and 100 officers fearful of storming the rural compound because of the clan's nine children. The impasse had begun 13 days before when <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> bombed a nearby Mormon chapel. Prosecutors contend it was the wheelchair-bound Singer who fired the fatal shot, but he told officers later that he was aiming at dogs and never intended to harm anyone. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, said the defense would place `` more of an emphasis on the psychological state'' of the defendants. During much of the standoff authorities aimed floodlights and recordings of high-pitched sirens at the 15 clan members inside the compound. Prosecutors are expected to duplicate much of the evidence presented during a federal trial last spring in which the Swapp brothers, Singer and his mother, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, were convicted of bombing and related charges. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, an excommunicated <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON>, admitted planting 87 sticks of dynamite at the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was divinely inspired to bomb the chapel to signal the impending collapse of church and state and to trigger the return of <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s late husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. Before jury selection began, District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> issued a 25-page, 276-question survey asking the 250 potential jurors whether they were active members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, if they attended services at the Marion chapel and whether they associated with any organized polygamous group. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> agreed to allow attorneys to question prospective jurors about whether they believed in divine revelation. The judge said he would not reject members of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus-Christ </ORGANIZATION> of Latter-day Saints who believe their faith's president, <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, is a prophet who receives divine revelations The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, whose name is on the tax cut that was the heart of Reaganomics, says he's hoping President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will give him a platform to keep spreading the word. In an interview Thursday, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would welcome an appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the bipartisan panel charged with making recommendations for reducing the federal budget deficit. The 53-year-old Republican from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is leaving the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after 18 years, having given up his seat when he bid unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says he's looking forward to spending a couple of years working for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research organization and making $ 15,000 speeches. Bt, with an eye toward perhaps a future run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he also wants to stay active in public policy. `` I'm interested in being a trouble shooter for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to make his administration a success.'' `` I would be interested in helping <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prove his case for a flexible freeze and economic growth'' to reduce the deficit, as an alternative to tax increases, he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was being honored Thursday night at a dinner hosted by two conservative `` think tanks,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as a conservative torchbearer. `` Wherever he is, he will fight for that cause, he will work for that cause, and what unites every single person in this room is our shared commitment to that cause,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so far is n't saying if he wants <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as part of his team. Asked about an economic commission appointment on Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed the question aside. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was an author of the Kemp-Roth income tax cut of 1981, and his appointment to the commission would underline <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` read my lips'' pledge of no new taxes. But `` When we're busy reading lips these days, we'll do well to remember that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, his lips move first and they move fastest. And if I know him, they're going to keep on moving,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> during Thursday night's tribute. However, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appointment to the commission might deepen doubts in the financial community about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to take strong action to cut the deficit. Kemp-Roth was based on the theory that growth would propel the government out of its red ink, but the budget deficit has risen to record levels since the tax cut was passed. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is seeking appointment to the commission even though he said earlier this year that the effort should be `` routinely passed into the dustbin of history.'' `` I told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> about a week ago that I'd be willing to do anything they wanted me to do'' to help in the area of trade and economics, he said. A Cabinet appointment was not necessary, and he would n't take a federal appointment just so he'd still have a title once his term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ends in January, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to be frantic to try to keep some artificial visibility,'' he said. `` If I were worried, I'd be doing other things.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would n't mind being considered for jobs such as secretary of the treasury, secretary of defense or secretary of state, but he concedes such positions _ two of which are already filled _ were not likely. `` I'm not frankly anxious to go into the Cabinet,'' he said when asked about speculation he was being considered for secretary of housing and urban development. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has been out front among <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Republicans in pushing inner-city revitalization, and that makes some consider him an attractive candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> job. But others say he's an activist and an advocate, not a bureaucrat. `` He's not a detail man at all. He's interested in the big picture,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economist. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> friend <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The key thing, from my standpoint, is making sure <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> has an important role as a spokesman and policymaker.'' Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, R-Minn., a conservative ally, said that if <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> does not get a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> position the party needs to `` find another role for him to play so that he continues to provide us leadership. `` He's clearly the leading intellectual House Republican of my lifetime,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga. `` It's like losing <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ... He has inspired a whole generation of younger members.'' As for an administration appointment, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is a quarterback. He has to have the ball and run with the ball. If they're not going to offer him a job that's large enough for his energy or his drive or his intellect, I think he's better off being at Heritage.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is joining other Reaganites such as former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as a distinguished fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, and he has signed on with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> speakers' bureau to book him engagements. `` I'm going to continue to speak out, travel and lecture'' whether or not an official appointment comes around, he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s first career, before entering politics, was as a professional football quarterback. But he plays down talk that he'd like to head his career back in that direction and succeed <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> as commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> will probably be around another three or four years, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says, and besides, `` In 1992, there might be other things doing.'' `` If I got the opportuity to run again, I'd certainly jump at the opportunity,'' he said.

 Police tore down barricades of burning tires, fired tear gas and arrested hundreds of protesters Thursday during an illegal general strike against government austerity measures, officials said. Police reported arresting 265 people during the daylong strike that the government had banned. Strike leader <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> claimed police arrested more than 500 people, most of them when demonstrators tried to march from surrounding neighborhoods into downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Authorities said leftist guerrillas seized and burned a city bus. However, no injuries were reported during the strike. It was the fourth general work stoppage this year and the fifth against the 3-year-old government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The strike comes during growing unrest caused by <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most serious economic recession this century. Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> charged the strike was being manipulated by the Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path to destabilize and eventually topple the elected government. Labor leaders denied that. At one point, a column of 50 hooded Shining Path guerrillas marched rapidly across a downtown plaza filled with strikers and then dispersed in the crowds. Police exploded tear gas canisters and fired their guns into the air to scatter the protesters. <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> said 80 percent of unionized workers had joined the strike, but the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> claimed 90 percent of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s offices, factories and other businesses were functioning. The capital is still reeling from a five-day power outage caused by leftist guerrillas last week, as well as sporadic water shortages and growing shortages of basic foods. The country has also been hit with a paralyzing mining strike, that began Oct. 17 and has led to numerous clashes between strikers and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> police. Labor leaders said the strike was called to protest measures imposed by the government last week to slow inflation estimated to reach 2,000 percent this year. Gen. <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s top police official, told reporters `` several subversives'' seized and burned a city bus after forcing passengers out. Authorities said 8,000 police maintained order, arresting 78 strikers as they set up roadblocks of burning tires and rubble. Police quickly tore down the barricades. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> rush hour traffic was lighter than normal with bus transportation down about 30 percent. Many stores and shops downtown opened late. <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> said demonstrations were held in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>. Radio stations reported disturbances in those cities, but it was unclear how effective the strike was outside <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Labor is seeking further pay increases following the austerity measures. The measures raised the minimum monthly wage from 15,000 to 24,000 intis, equivalent to about $ 50, but more than doubled food prices and devalued currency 50 percent.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the new Democratic leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that he will take the lead in proposing ways to pare the huge federal budge deficit. Faced with calls from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and other top Democrats to make the first move on deficit reduction, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` That is exactly what I intend to do'' once he becomes president. `` I am confident that we can work together,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> faced reporters on the White House driveway after breakfast together, the latest in a series of culinary goodwill gestures toward congressional leaders. `` I'm not naive about it, nor is he, and there will be different approaches on some of these major problems facing this country,'' said the vice president. He said he will take the lead on the deficit `` and then there will be, I'm sure, active discussion ... negotiation with whoever he designates to try to solve these problems.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he wo n't be rushed into making Cabinet appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be troubling to prospects such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator keeping a long vigil for the Pentagon opening. `` We're trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to back up appointments at all levels,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked about reports of internal strife within his camp over whether to give the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post to Tower, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman now a paid consultant to several major defense contractors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to somebody it concerns me no matter who it is. Senator Tower's a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while to go forward.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss taxes or any budget-cutting specifics, but he called the vice president `` keenly aware of the seriousness of the -LRB- deficit -RRB- situation.'' The senator called the discussion `` cordial and productive. ... He understands that it is his responsibility to proceed first and he will do so.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deserves time to get his economic team in place and settle upon a deficit-reduction stratgy. The vice president had lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and joined him at a meeting with Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to discuss next week's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> both spoke Thursday night at a testimonial dinner for retiring Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In his tribute to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, his first rival for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We're all of us in your debt and I for one will never forget it.'' `` When we're busy reading lips these days, we'll do well to remember that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, his lips move first and they move fastest. And if I know him, they're going to keep on moving,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a reference to his own campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside a question about whether he would give <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> the appointment <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> wants to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to fight any proposals to raise taxes. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had said before the election the panel's work should be `` routinely passed into the dustbin of history.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with another former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in the morning before laying out the welcome mat at his home for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the defeated Democratic presidential nominee, in the afternoon. Later Friday, he will receive Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose inauguration he attended five years ago. The president-elect said he still has not decided whether he will send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a completely revised version of the fiscal 1990 budget that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> must propose by Jan. 9. He said his choice for budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, `` has already begun crunching some of the numbers. As soon as we have our whole economic team in place ... we'll be in a better position to answer how I will proceed.'' But faced with pointed warnings from <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and other top Democrats that he should not try to lay the burden of deficit-reduction on them, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will stick his neck out first. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also discussed the vice president's role in next week's meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with visiting Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They did not discuss the future of aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, a constant source of friction between congressional Democrats and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` We all owe to the president-elect the simple courtesy ... to wait until he has a chance to get his team together and make his plan,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said a failed uprising at an army garrison and looting of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> arsenal Thursday reflected military discontent over prosecution of officers for human rights abuses. `` Apparently, by their simultaneity, they were linked,'' defense spokesman <PERSON> Faustino </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It was not over -LRB- low -RRB- pay. It was a question of ideology.'' Fifty-three members of an elite <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit tied up three guards at their base in <LOCATION> Olivos </LOCATION>, nine miles north of the capital, and drove off in three trucks. They took with them four machine guns, 200 rifles, 30 handguns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, officials said. <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> police helicopters searched the main roads, but by 11 p.m. the whereabouts of the raiders still were unknown. At the 3rd Infantry Regiment in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tablada </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, Capt. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>, son of imprisoned former President <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>, tried to rally soldiers to take over the garrison, <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said. The attempt was quelled and <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> arrested. A similar incident occurred at an army communications facility in <LOCATION> Citybell </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the capital, and that, too, was put down, he said. President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> commented earlier Thursday that `` all is under control'' in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and `` This is a bunch of rubbish, just a little problem that took place and is not that important.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> spoke to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was there for the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> rejected speculation that the motive was low pay. In recent months soldiers have been grumbling that their pay does n't keep up with 331 percent annual inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit shouted `` Viva Rico!'' as they left their base in the early hours Thursday, <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said. Cashiered Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> led short-lived garrison uprisings against the army command in April 1987 and January 1988 over the prosecution of military men in civilian courts for human rights abuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship. `` It does n't mean he organized it, but it shows they identified with him,'' <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said. At least 9,000 Argentines `` disappeared'' and were presumed killed during the military's crackdown on suspected leftist subversives, a commission appointed by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> reported in 1985. <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> is in military prison in <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION>, 43 miles south of the capital, as is <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>, the former commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In December 1985, a civilian court convicted <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>; former President Gen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> and three other former junta members for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder. Human rights trials against other officers are resuming after a lapse of about a year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to a $ 1 billion cleanup of a uranium processing plant that has dumped thousands of pounds of radioactive waste into the environment, state and federal officials said Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, state Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> declined to release details of the agreement on the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. Formal announcement of the deal was scheduled Friday, the officials said. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said Wednesday he would not accept any agreement in which the federal government would not pay the complete cost of the Fernald cleanup, estimated at $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, a DOE spokesman in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said it was reasonable to assume that the federal government will pay for all of the cleanup. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Grone </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, operations, said the agreement would be a consent decree subject to federal court approval. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Grone </PERSON> said the government will have already spent $ 355 million by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and workplace safety efforts already under way. The 37-year-old plant processes and molds uranium for use in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s production of nuclear weapons. which are made at other locations. Production was halted by a strike Oct. 7. State and DOE officials had been working toward a cleanup agreement prior to lawsuits the state filed against the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and 1987. The talks continued after the lawsuits were filed. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> wants a settlement that would give the state authority to oversee the cleanup. The state blames the DOE for alleged contamination of air and water at the 1,050-acre plant, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The plant sits above the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer, a water source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted the plant has emitted at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere during three decades of operation. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer and create a major health hazard. Water sampling has not revealed evidence of notable contamination in regional public water supplies, but monitoring will continue, <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> told reporters. Neighbors have sued the department and its former operator, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, accusing the plant of polluting the environment with radioactive materials, creating a health hazard and ruining property values. The lawsuit also is pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government can sue former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> for allegedly stealing huge sums from the country before fleeing. The court also maintained a freeze on the couple's suspected multibillion-dollar worldwide holdings. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' position as a former foreign leader did not protect him from lawsuits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. The `` act of state'' doctrine, which prohibits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judicial review of sovereign acts by another nation, `` is not a promise to the ruler of any foreign country that his conduct, if challenged by his own country after his fall, may not become the subject of scrutiny in our courts,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>. `` The doctrine is meant to facilitate the foreign relations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not to furnish the equivalent of sovereign immunity to a deposed leader.'' <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said the lawsuit filed by the new <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has `` a fair chance of succeeding.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, fled <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986 after a military-civilian revolt ended his 20-year rule. The couple has been living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since then. They were indicted Oct. 21 on criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' treasury and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and was released on $ 5 million bail. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who is reportedly in poor health, has not appeared in court. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Aquino government, called the decision to continue a freeze on the Marcoses' holdings `` a critically important affirmation of the courageous ruling ... which hopefully has held in place the monies that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has secreted away.'' The lawsuit on behalf of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people contends the couple used the proceeds of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' alleged looting to invest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property, both before and after he was deposed. In addition, the lawsuit claims the couple hid other stolen assets in Swiss banks and elsewhere _ at least $ 1.5 billion and perhaps as much as $ 20 billion, according to a lawyer for the Aquino government. Claiming violations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> racketeering laws, as well as bribes, theft, extortion, conspiracy and other violations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the lawsuit seeks return of the property plus $ 50 billion in punitive damages. Lawyers for the Marcoses have contended the civil lawsuit belongs in <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> courts. They also argue that the lawsuit raises essentially political questions requiring a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court to decide the legality of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule, issues beyond the competence of judges. <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said the lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that a court can evaluate. `` Bribetaking, theft, embezzlement, extortion, fraud and conspiracy to do these things are all acts susceptible of concrete proofs that need not involve political questions,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts are capable of interpreting <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> law and `` have had no difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposed ruler from his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law,'' the judge said.

 A doctor charged with killing his terminally ill wife with a drug overdose after she unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide was cleared of all charges Thursday in a case sparked by a TV interview. Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, who said he wanted to end his wife's suffering from cancer, was found innocent of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy. The state charged that Rosier obtained Seconal sedatives for his wife to commit suicide, administered morphine when the Seconal only left her comatose, and eventually manipulated her stepfather and brothers into finishing the job by smothering her. Rosier, a Fort Myers pathologist who faced up to life in prison, jumped to his feet and wept when the verdict was read. Then he hugged his children. Later, he said all he felt was `` relief. The pain of this trial was over. ... The love of my life was vindicated.'' Rosier later said, `` If anything good has come out of this it is perhaps that people in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will start to look at the terminally ill and the rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible tragedy that befell <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> and the rest of our family.'' The charges were brought after Rosier appeared on a television interview and described administering the drug overdoses to his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, who was 43 when she died Jan. 15, 1986. Prosecutors contended he hoped to profit from her death with a book about it. The <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated slightly more than three hours after hearing four weeks of testimony. An alternate juror who was excused when deliberations began said that while he was opposed to mercy killing, he did n't think the state proved premeditated murder. `` I could n't specifically find him guilty of first-degree murder myself. Maybe attempted. Maybe conspiracy,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 29, a savings and loan security guard. `` From the evidence, I just do n't think he met the key elements in ending the life I think that's what the Almighty God is supposed to do. The prosecution charged that <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 47, pained by his wife's fast-spreading cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to take and administered morphine injections and suppositories when she did n't die from the After she lingered for 12 hours in a comatose state, her stepfather, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, testified he decided `` enough's enough,'' went into her bedroom and smothered her while his two sons watched <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> and his sons <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> received immunity from prosecution in return for their testimony before prosecutors knew of their role in her death. Prosecutors said they had no choice but to give them immunity because the body was cremated and there were no other witnesses. Prosecutors maintained that <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> used his medical expertise to engineer his wife's death in conspiracy with the <LOCATION> Delmans </LOCATION> and manipulated them into committing the final act. But the defense portrayed <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> as a loving husband of 22 years who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful end. Neither side disputed that Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> wanted to commit suicide when she learned cancer had spread from her lungs to her brain and adrenal glands. `` He was a skilled and conscientious pathologist, this man they're trying to paint as ` killer doc,''' defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said in closing arguments Wednesday. `` It's not ` killer doc.' It's a good, decent man who made serious mistakes in his life, who made self-destructive mistakes. `` The state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bought a pig in a poke _ three times,'' said <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, who did not call any witnesses. `` The three <PERSON> Delmans </PERSON> who ended <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>'s life _ they walk _ and a loving husband of 22 years is put on trial for murder.''

A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said the three employees _ two Afghans and a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbeau </PERSON> _ were detained by an unknown group and released Monday He said they were in a 17-truck convoy delivering grain to areas outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> said the convoy was the first to try delivering food to outlying areas under the U.N.-sponsored program. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said members of <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group blocked a road in <LOCATION> Parwan </LOCATION> province, central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and looted 10 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trucks.

 A Holocaust survivor splashed acid in the face of a lawyer for convicted Nazi war criminal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> at a funeral Thursday for another <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> attorney who committed suicide. The injured lawyer, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON>, was reported in satisfactory condition at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s eye unit, where he was transferred for treatment after the incident. The attorney complained of blurred vision and pain in his left eye and will be kept under observation for several days, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON>, a Hadassah spokeswoman. A woman standing near <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> suffered a minor eye injury from the acid. Police identified the assailant as 70-year-old <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON>, who was detained after the attack at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Sanhedria Cemetery He was seen being led away with his hands cupped over his face. The national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted the assailant as telling police interrogators that all his family were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and that `` these killers are not worthy of defense.'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the attack, announced it was canceling the scheduled broadcast of a documentary film on the <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> trial. Police officials who insisted on anonymity said <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON> lived in a home for the elderly in the working-class <LOCATION> Katamon </LOCATION> quarter of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He was employed as a guard at the Education Ministry, they said. Divorced and the father of three children, <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON> was believed to be from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, they said. Reporters who covered the 14-month <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> trial said <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON> was a frequent spectator. The police officials said <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON> apparently was upset about the suicide of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, who was buried Thursday. They quoted him as telling neighbors: `` I wanted to speak to <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, and now I have nobody to talk to.'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a 53-year-old former district judge, died Tuesday after jumping from a 15th floor hotel window in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police said the death was a suicide. Itim quoted an unidentified witness as saying the assailant shouted `` <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> died because of you!'' before hurling the acid. The injured woman, identified as <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, was released after treatment, hospital officials said. Ms. <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that she heard <PERSON> Yehezkieli </PERSON> shout `` Everything is because of you!'' then felt the acid strike her face. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>'s death has delayed <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal of a death sentence until May 4. The appeal had been scheduled to begin Monday. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a 68-year-old retired autoworker from suburban <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, was sentenced to death in April for committing crimes against humanity and the Jewish people as an operator of gas chambers at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews perished during World War II. He has consistently denied he was `` Ivan the Terrible'' of the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> camp. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> that the family was saddened by the acid-throwing incident. `` It shows there is very much emotion surrounding this trial,'' he said. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said the attack on <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> could hamper the family's efforts to find an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> lawyer to replace <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> in the case `` This is going to make it even more difficult to find another attorney,'' he said.

The board went into executive session at 8:45 p.m. for about 50 minutes before postponing the decision to review testimony and examine evidence. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had said the special <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> school board meeting probably would end his 20-year association with Point Pleasant High, where his daughter is the student body president. `` I expect to be fired,'' he said. About 80 people crammed into the meeting room before the board went into executive session. The controversy began in August when the board said male instructors would have to wear ties, a change from contracts teachers signed last spring. Three teachers followed normal grievance procedures and lost. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, farmer who teaches high-level math at Point Pleasant High, ignored the order and was suspended three times. The board changed its policy again Nov. 21 and allowed male employees to go tieless, but still prohibits jeans and denim. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> is opposed to any change in his contract. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> told the board Thursday night that a decision to fire <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> would have repercussions. `` It will certainly be reversed by the courts, and that will embarrass the school board. You're taking a cannon to shoot down a mosquito,'' <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> said. School Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said `` non-verbal behavior is much more believable than verbal behavior.'' He said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s fight was disruptive in the classroom and set a bad example for his 122 students. `` Teachers are adult role models for their students. The habits and behavior patterns of students are influenced by what they observe in their teachers,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON>, said the 15 charges that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> cited in his opening address were moot because the board has changed its policy. <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s refusal was not insubordination but simply civil disobedience. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> originally was suspended for four days with pay in early October, then for 11 days without pay later in the month. On Halloween, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> for up to 30 days without pay. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> has an appeal of the 11-day suspension pending with a state hearing examiner, who must reach a decision by Dec. 15. Before Thursday's hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> offered <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> a final chance to give up wearing jeans to class and to drop his state appeal, which includes an attempt to recover 41 days of pay. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> rejected the offer.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> took office Thursday and promised to push for political and economic modernization, as opponents protested his inauguration in congress and in the streets. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a 40-year-old economist, succeeds President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> for a six-year term. He inherits an economy threatened by both recession and inflation, growth squeezed by a $ 102 billion foreign debt, and a population impatient after six years of austerity that reduced earnings about 50 percent. `` I take office in a complex hour. ... It is a singular moment in our history, heavy with risks but rich in opportunity,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said in his inaugural address. He said he would govern `` for all Mexicans'' and promised `` nationalist, democratic and popular'' reforms. He said efforts to reduce <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt would begin immediately. About 140 delegates from the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> walked out of the Legislative Palace just before <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was inaugurated, and members of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held up signs declaring `` Fraud.'' `` We are walking out because we do n't want to endorse with our presence the legitimacy of the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> government,'' said delegate <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. The opposition maintains that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> cheated to win the July 6 presidential election and that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was the real victor Outside, thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> supporters threw rocks at police. Many in the crowd carried sticks. Several police and demonstrators were injured. Police used tear gas to disperse about 1,500 demonstrators in the Zocalo, the central square in front of the National Palace where a post-inauguration parade was held. One woman held up two dead rats and said they symbolized <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> paramedic <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said about 150 people were injured, including police and soldiers, and treated at the scene. A police spokeswoman said many arrests were made. Scattered demonstrations persisted through the day. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> invited the opposition to a political dialogue that would include `` perfecting'' the electoral process, but said political change is not enough. Unless the economic crisis is overcome, he said, `` stagnation will wilt democracy, political competition will turn into social conflict and frustrate aims for social justice.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said negotiations will begin at once on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt, aimed at cutting debt payments to a level that will leave the country with enough money to invest in development and growth. `` We will look for new equilibriums with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an area of opportunities and delicate differences,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had an afternoon meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and praised his inaugural address. He told reporters <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> felt `` good chemistry'' existed between himself and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In an unusual arrangement, opposition leaders were permitted to make televised speeches questioning <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' election before the inauguration. In return, they agreed not to disrupt the actual ceremony. Although the speeches were televised, walkouts and protest signs were not shown. Cameras also avoided showing the brief violence in the Zocalo. The new president outlined a vision of modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in keeping with his free market ideas, in which a paternalistic state would give way to a partnership of political parties, business, labor, citizens' groups and the church. Democratic Front delegate <PERSON> Marcela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON> said in her speech that Mexicans had actually voted for a `` radically different program.'' In his campaign, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> called for increased government control of the economy and a moratorium on debt payments. According to official figures, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won barely more than 50 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won 31 percent and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, 17 percent. During his speech <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> introduced heads of government attending. The biggest rounds of applause went to presidents <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Also there were presidents <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation included <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Mexican-American wife, <PERSON> Columba </PERSON>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused a request by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to issue a visa to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> so the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman can speak to the world body on the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> issue, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday. Arab diplomats said they would introduce a resolution Friday morning to move the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. A ranking <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said a vote to move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> could be taken Monday and approval was certain. `` The secretary-general has received from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a reply to the resolution adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to review and rescind its decision not to issue a visa to Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` This reply from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is negative, and will be contained in a report by the secretary-general to come out tomorrow morning,'' he added. The letter of refusal was `` extremely negative,'' said a diplomatic source who saw the note. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wanted to speak Thursday, the original opening day of the assembly debate on Palestinian issues. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied the visa last Saturday on grounds the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was an accessory to terrorism. Earlier Thursday, a rally outside <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters intended to welcome <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> became a protest by about 400 people at which Palestinians and a few dozen anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews denounced the refusal of a visa. Demostrators waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and pictures of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chanting `` Long Live the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>!'' Most of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> wore checked head scarves, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s trademark. Standing among them holding anti-Zionist banners were ultra-Orthodox Jews, in long black coats and wide brimmed hats, who belong to the Orthodox Jews Against Zionism -LRB- <PERSON> Neturei </PERSON> <PERSON> Karta </PERSON> -RRB- group and oppose the concept of a Jewish state. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for refusing to let <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> address it, giving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until midnight Thursday to provide a visa. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the resolution, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wants to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> about the declaration of an independent Palestinian state Nov. 15 and a political statement that implicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the Secretariat was making plans to move the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where the session is expected to reconvene in mid-December. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it does not oppose a move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and would participate in the debate there. If the meeting goes to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, it would be the first time the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has transferred a meeting out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in protest. The resolution authorizing the move must be heard by a 16-member budgetary advisory committee Friday because of the expense involved, then would go to the General Assembly's finance committee before reaching a vote in the assembly itself. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has had a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission since 1975 and holds non-voting observer status. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> considers it the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and invites it to speak in debates concerning Palestinians and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

 The most recent surprise inspections of the nation's nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent did n't properly administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene, the government reported Thursday. In a 75-volume guide for consumers, federal officials released grades for each of the 15,000 nursing homes on 32 of the approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once a year in on-site inspections. Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories. But about 2,400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32 categories. The massive report, a compilation of material previously available only on a piece-meal basis through state regulatory agencies, amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for people looking for a nursing home.

<TEXT>
 In the central highlands of this island nation, health officials are using <ORGANIZATION> DTT </ORGANIZATION>, banned in other parts of the world, to combat a disease that once was under control _ malaria. Specially trained teams are spraying the inner walls of thousands of homes with the powerful insecticide because it is deemed the most effective and practical way for <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, a nation struggling with economic problems. A resurgence of malaria in the central highlands has already claimed thousands of lives in the last two years, and a government report said malaria could claim 100,000 to 250,000 lives in the next six months if emergency measures were not taken. Malaria had largely disappeared from the central highlands, a strip up to 170 miles wide running nearly 850 miles north to south, after <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colonial authorities used DDT in antimalarial campaigns and drugs to treat those who got the disease. But the spraying stopped after independence in 1960, and in the economic decline that followed a Socialist revolution in 1975, antimalarial drugs, which had to be imported, were not available. At the same time, the highlanders lost the moderate immunity people of hyperendemic malarious areas usually develop. `` When it started coming back, people did n't know what it was,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakotojoelinadrasana </PERSON>, who directs two <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> clinics. `` They thought it was a new disease and they named it ` Bemangovitra,' which means the ` big chills'.'' Even if people had recognized it as the old <LOCATION> Tazomoka </LOCATION> -LRB- mosquito fever -RRB- there were virtually no drugs available to combat it. The country had no foreign exchange to import drugs, and people would n't have been able to afford to buy them in a country where income has been falling for 20 years and wages average the equivalent of a dollar a day or less `` The nutritional status had fallen so much it made it much more severe than in a healthy population,'' said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaiffier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. No reliable figures are available on how many people have died of malaria in recent years, as any fever is usually diagnosed as malaria. Few facilities are available for blood tests, and many people have no access to any health care. Health Minister <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative, Dr. <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakizimana </PERSON>, said published reports of 100,000 deaths were exaggerated. World Bank specialists said the toll was probably more in the range of 30,000 and Dr. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulanges </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pasteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> here, said the toll could be as high as 50,000 and in some villages 20 percent of the residents had died. The plan to combat the malaria threat includes two controversial elements. The first is the use of DDT, banned in developed countries after it was found to be entering the food chain. <PERSON> Hakizimana </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had approved DDT as a one-time measure because of the grave threat <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> faced, and it will only be used inside houses, not on crops. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaiffier </PERSON> said DDT has acquired such a bad name that it was n't easy to find the 50 to 80 tons needed in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> It is preferred because it remains effective for six months or more, through the rainy season on the 226,658-square-mile island of 11 million people. Spraying on the walls will be effective because the malarial mosquitoes rest on walls after biting their victims, said <PERSON> Rakotojoelinadrasana </PERSON>. The second controversy involves the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of providing drugs for treatment after people are infected rather than distributing them for prophylaxsis, or prevention Health Minister <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> said the government will make drugs available for prophylaxsis only for children up to age 6 and pregnant women. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> recommends against use of drugs for prophylaxsis in hyperendemic areas because of the cost, fears that it will facilitate the spread of resistance and concerns about the side effects. `` The WHO recommendation is logical on theoretical grounds,'' <PERSON> Rakotojoelinadrasana </PERSON> said. `` But the problem is that people who get malaria may die from it. As medical doctors we are hesitating to advise people to get malaria and then come to us.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaiffier </PERSON> said scientists are very worried about the increasing prevalance of malaria in higher elevations. It is `` following economic development up the mountain where there are new population reservoirs with no immunity,'' he added. Farmers are using every piece of land they can find, including steep hillsides, to grow rice and other crops. Rice is heavily consumed in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and rice fields are perfect breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes.

 Reports of a spate of witchcraft rituals troubled one <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community so much they became a priority to the police, and investigators soon turned to a rarely tapped source: the library. In a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> parish, the police chief wanted the names of those who had checked out library materials on the occult, not because there was a problem `` but just in case there might be one in the future.'' Increasingly librarians resist requests for records of what books, films or other materials their patrons check out. They say the borrowings could be misinterpreted, placing innocent people under false suspicion. Further, said <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>: `` If people really understood what they could get about other people ... by tapping their library records, we'd be out of the library business.'' In this state, where an Open Records law does not exempt library records from public scrutiny, librarians have proposed legislation to make the records confidential. Thirty-eight states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> already have such a statute, requiring a court order to release the records. `` We're not obstructionists,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Krug </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We just want to be sure the police or anybody else just ca n't walk in half-cocked for no good reason.'' Ms. <PERSON> Krug </PERSON> said the organization has fought since 1970 against releasing records. She cited the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> case, calling the police chief's request `` absolutely ridiculous,'' and she recalled a librarian at <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who spent 15 days in jail in the early 1970s for refusing federal investigators' demand for the records of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war protesters <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>. The case was one of the factors that led to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s decision to pass a confidentiality law, she said Besides <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the states that do not have library confidentiality laws are <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, although attorneys general in the latter two states have issued opinions favoring confidentiality. In the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> battle over the Open Records law, law enforcement lobbyists say library records are a valuable if rarely used investigative tool they will not relinquish. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, however, calls public access to the records a loophole in the law and an assault on the First Amendment. The difference of opinion has forced many of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 250 public libraries to adopt policies that contradict the law. In 1983, one librarian nearly landed in jail for his defiance. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, with 4,100 members between them, drafted legislation that would make patron records confidential, permitting their release to police only under a court order. The measure cleared the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but has been stalled by opposition in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee _ and now Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said amendments have changed the bill so much the library groups no longer support it. The amendments, backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecuting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, would, among other things, eliminate the court-order requirement. The OLA plans to re-introduce its bill next year. A survey conducted by the association earlier this year found that six of 40 libraries questioned had received requests from local and state police for information about patrons and what they had borrowed. Eighteen reported that patrons had inquired about fellow patrons. In all of the instances, including the case of the alleged witchcraft rituals in <LOCATION> Defiance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the requests were rejected under library policies that forbid release of such information without a court order. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also is interested in the reading habits of library patrons and has tried to recruit library personnel around the country to watch their patrons, according to recently released federal records. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent visited the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> library </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and again in 1986 to check the reading lists of two Soviet citizens, said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Both times, the agent's request was rejected by head librarian <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> Librarians would prefer that none of the patron-related information they guard be made public, but realize a need to help the authorities in legitimate cases, Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` We're not refusing to help. In fact, we want to,'' she said. `` But we will not allow fishing expeditions, and we will not allow innocent people to be put under suspicion simply because they use a library.'' `` We're trying to protect people's rights here,'' she said. Librarians also fear they will be held liable if information they release results in harm to the patron, although an amendment proposed by law enforcement groups would relieve a librarian of criminal or civil liability. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said another amendment was crucial: `` The OLA wants the police to testify about what they're looking for at a hearing before they get a court order. That hearing, which would probably be public, defeats the whole purpose of an investigation. You do n't want the person you're looking for to know you're looking for them `` That could put innocent people in a bad light.'' The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> thinks even requiring a court order would be insufficient protection. `` None of this should be made public,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>. `` Opening these records to the police or the courts would suddenly and improperly make someone a suspect merely because they like to read.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON>, executive librarian of the <LOCATION> Akron-Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION>, was threatened with jail for refusing to comply with a subpoena seeking a list of reading material requested by a jail inmate who was suspected in attacks on several women. The attacker had quoted French writer <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Villon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said the subpoena, seeking a list of everything the man checked out, was too broad. But after prosecutors agreed to rewrite it to specify release only of information related to <PERSON> Villon </PERSON>'s works, the library complied. The inmate, who had indeed checked out <PERSON> Villon </PERSON>, was convicted. He had also been identified in a lineup. Librarians say their policies protect the confidentiality of more than patron reading lists. Several libraries reported they have refused solitications from companies asking to buy a list of patrons' names, addresses and telephone numbers, and from collection agencies looking for delinquent consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> this year launched an effort to pass federal confidentiality legislation that would have covered library records and other services, including video rentals. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had sought access to library information without a court order in cases involving national security. The bill died when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned. Said Ms. <PERSON> Krug </PERSON>, `` We're going to try again, and probably again.''

<TEXT>
 The most irritating thing about Sunday's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Tenth Man,'' is how self-consciously Important it is. Based on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s intriguing story of a French lawyer imprisoned by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> -RRB- who trades his wealth for his life, `` The Tenth Man'' is tedious and overwrought, as exemplified by the cloyingly romantic music overwhelming almost every scene. It's composed by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Holdridge </PERSON>, who wrote the theme for `` Beauty and the Beast.'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> can be effecting in the right role, but here he is merely irritating, employing varying degrees of one emotion: dumbfounded. There is some hope when the flamboyant <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> bursts on the scene late in the drama to add the final plot twist, but by then it's snoozing time. The movie was shot on location in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Why? Most of the scenes are interiors. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavel </PERSON>, a successful attorney with an estate outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who is accidentally picked up in a Nazi sweep of innocent citizenry.

 This is a tale of two people who opened a pizza parlor, and learned to their chagrin that a mandated benefit is really a tax. It is a story related by Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who is also dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, in an effort to make clear that taxes and mandated benefits carry similar burdens. The term `` mandated benefits'' is one of those euphemisms used to avoid the stigma of the terrible `` T'' word, and that suggests it could get a workout during an administration pledged to no tax increases. The partners scrape together $ 20,000 and enough other financing to get into operation. They employ 20 people the first year and manage to take home $ 15,000 each, enough to stay in business rather than working for someone else. Since there are a large number of pizza places, it soon becomes clear they can not make much more than $ 15,000 each because of the competition. So, each year they settle for $ 15,000 each. Then, suddenly, they are required to provide health insurance for the 20 workers, most of whom are young and already covered by family insurance. This costs $ 500 a year for each employee, or a total of $ 10,000 a year. At the end of the year, therefore, the two partners have earned only $ 10,000 each to support their families. Something must be done; a conference is held. They consider closing shop and working for someone else, but that would mean firing 20 employees. They could be content with $ 10,000 each, though they could make $ 15,000 elsewhere. They could cut wages. They could raise prices. They decide to raise prices. So do their competitors, who are faced with the same situation. However, it becomes clear that at higher prices people buy less pizza. They are forced to fire an employee. Their competitors do likewise. As a result, at the end of the year they are nearly able to restore their $ 15,000 salaries. In effect, their customers and the employees who lost their jobs paid for the mandated benefits. Somebody had to. Ultimately, it might have worked out differently. As an alternative, the market might have reduced the cash pay of all pizza workers so that the cash, plus the new health benefits, would have equaled the old wages. If that were the eventuality, those receiving the benefits would have paid directly. But they might have rebelled, especially since most did not want the coverage. Even worse, those that did, might have gotten them cheaper elsewhere. Now, says <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, substitute `` profit tax'' or `` minimum wage'' or `` mandatory child care'' or any other mandated government program. You would get the same results as were obtained from the mandated medical insurance. Now, the professor suggests, consider this: Many people receive so-called benefits they do not want. Many who receive benefits are not members of the target groups that government is trying to help. In such ways, says <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, we lay waste our tax money. And the waste is worsened by the medium of distribution, which is the small company. Small companies, he observes, are not efficient administrators of social programs. What small companies do well _ and 90 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers have 20 or fewer employees _ is produce goods and services. When we divert them from what they do well, says <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, the entire economy suffers. He says these programs can mean higher prices for poor and rich alike, maybe lower wages, inefficient distribution of services, layoffs, and perhaps fewer businesses. Many people will be forced to pay for and receive services they do not want. Even worse, most of the benefits will be received by consumers who do not belong to the target groups that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> desires to help. Mandated benefits? `` It's a terrible idea, and it is time we recognized it as such,'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dutch Farmers Told to Keep Cows in Barn to Protect Water Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIERLINGSBEEK, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have ordered an 8 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew from spring to fall for cows in the pastures of this small Dutch farming community. The new measure requires farmers to put their cattle in barns at night and keep their droppings outdoors from polluting the area's drinking water The curfew, which takes effect Jan. 1, 1990, has farmers irate. For as long as anyone can remember they have left their cattle in the pastures at night during the warm months, saving the expense and time of moving them in and out of barns every day. But environmentalists claim the cows' nights out are causing a serious pollution threat to the water supplies of tens of thousands of people in the southeastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` The measure is part of a package to curb the contamination of our drinking water supplies with nitrates,'' said <PERSON> Henk </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loon </PERSON>, a spokesman for Noord-Brabant, the southern province that includes this town of 7,800 people, 70 miles southeast from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, the provincial environmental agency established that in the Vierlingsbeek reservoirs, which supplies drinking water to 25,000 households in the area, the levels of nitrates, which are components of animal excrement, were three times as high as the 200 milligrams per gallon allowed under Dutch law. The human body converts nitrates into nitrites, which can damage the adrenal glands, especially in infants. `` It was time to do something drastic,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loon </PERSON> said. Two-thirds of Dutch households get their drinking water from deposits such as those in <LOCATION> Vierlingsbeek </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vierlingsbeek </PERSON>'s farmers plan a campaign to protest the measure, which their spokesman, <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuenen </PERSON>, claims will cost them `` fortunes.'' He explained that herding the cattle to and from pastures every day _ instead of letting them out and keeping them out from April to November _ will mean higher labor costs for farmers. `` It will take hours to get the animals into the pastures and back,'' <PERSON> Kuenen </PERSON> said. `` We're being singled out while there are many more sources of nitrate pollution.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures indicate that the main source of ground water pollution is the 90,000 tons of manure produced annually by 5 million cows, 14 million pigs, and 92 million chickens. Pigs and chickens are put indoors at night year-round, but their droppings are often disposed of outdoors. `` The only way out was to ban animals from the land for part of the day,'' said provincial spokesman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loon </PERSON>. Under the provincial bylaw creating the curfew, cattle breeders face stiff fines if they let their cattle graze at night. The curfew covers 1,771 acres of grazing land covering water holdings in <LOCATION> Vierlingsbeek </LOCATION> and neighboring <PERSON> Boxmeer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loon </PERSON> said. The measure also strictly limits the nitrate content of fertilizers used by the area's corn growers, he said. Farmers contend they are n't the only culprits. The Rhine and the Meuse rivers, which together provide some 30 percent of the drinking water needs of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' 11 million people, are heavily contaminated with pesticides and herbicides dumped by West German and Swiss chemical companies, according to <LOCATION> Jur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lieffering </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that Dutch produce growers also were contributing to the crisis via herbicide and insecticide use.

<HEAD>Chicken Pox Keeps Mick Jones Off the Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A case of chicken pox made <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> cancel this fall's `` Big Audio Dynamite'' tour. But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> vows to come back. `` Tighten Up Vol. 88'' is the band's latest album and `` Just Play Music,'' the first single, is receiving radio play in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. With the group planning to resume touring after the new year, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is anxious to regain its previous momentum. `` I think it's a growing thing, a matter of getting people to listen, changing the way they think. I just want to communicate and play music,'' said the 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter, who recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable,'' he said, before canceling the tour. `` We were ravaged by the critics, but the music was n't for them. It was for more _ it was music with a reason, with something to say. You can put us on page 13 of your paper, but you ca n't ignore us because the other stuff is going to whither and die.'' That touch of drama should be no surprise coming from <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who help lead the British punk movement with the Clash a decade ago. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1955. A fan of such groups as the Animals and the Kinks, he considered rock' n' roll `` the most exciting thing around.'' But in the 1970s, he and many other fans grew disillusioned with the direction of rock. Punk groups began to appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of mainstream rock and society in general. Like the Sex Pistols, the Clash were crude, loud, angry and threatening. In short everything they thought rock' n' roll should be. `` It needed to happen,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` We needed it at that time.'' <PERSON> Punk </PERSON> was n't simply a kind of music, it was an attitude. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, like many who grew up in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the'60s and'70s, felt that the more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans. `` The music's just as much about the fans,'' he said. `` They're very important They do n't want go to the show and just have their wallet emptied. They've got T-shirts, but they're not anywhere. You need to take it to the next place.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonon </PERSON> were in the punk group <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> SS before forming the Clash in 1976 with singer-guitarist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON>, previously a member of the 101ers. `` At the time I was just expressing myself the only way I could,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We looked at it as if we had a foot in the door and we were going to go in that door. There has never been anything like it since.'' Their self-titled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some of the most ferocious music ever recorded. As one reviewer noted, it was music that `` never stops snarling. It's always threatening to blow up in your face.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected letter bombs, readily agreed with that assessment. `` It was quite a rush,'' he said. `` It sounded beautiful to us. Music should explode, it should n't be contained and well behaved and do what it's told.'' Although the Clash went on to record classic albums such as `` Give ` Em Enough Rope'' and `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Calling,'' the members of the band started feuding and by 1984, the group had broken up. `` In the end, we ended up writing our own things and sort of handing them over. It was n't as much fun.'' So <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> decided to start fresh. He was n't interested in forming a `` <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> Project''; he wanted prospective bandmates to think of themselves as equals. `` ` Ideas' was the main word. I wanted to have people with good ideas and fresh ideas,'' he said. `` I was a good enough musician by that time. I looked for people who had personality. I did n't want it to just be me.'' But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> could n't deny who would emerge as the band's leader. `` It's a dictatorship,'' he said, smiling, `` but a benevolent dictatorahip. I wanted to make it a more democratic thing. I try and listen to the others.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> pieced together a new group, starting with his friend and ex-Clash video director <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Letts </PERSON> -LRB- credited with `` FX and Vocals'' -RRB-. He added bassist <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> `` E-Zee Kill'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Drummer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was hired through a newspaper ad, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> then brought in keyboardist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> who originally came to photograph the band. The group was named Big Audio Dynamite -LRB- B.A.D. -RRB-, and drew on a variety of musical styles, notably reggae. The first record, `` This Is Big Audio Dynamite,'' was released in 1985, and eventually went gold in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON> briefly reunited with <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to co-write and co-produce B.A.D.'s next record, `` No. 10 Upping Street,'' with its hit single, `` <LOCATION> Badrock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Atlantic City Offers Novelists The Right ``Glitter And Sleaze''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drawn by the bright and dazzling lights of casinos and the bleak squalor of the urban area beyond the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has become a popular setting for filmmakers and novelists crafting tales of organized crime, drugs, prostitution, gambling and murder. `` An ugly mixture of glitter and sleaze,'' is how novelist <PERSON> Ovid </PERSON> <PERSON> Demaris </PERSON> sees the city in his upcoming work, `` Ricochet.'' In `` Under the Boardwalk,'' author <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s characters are portrayed in a `` universe of dazzle and slime.'' TV viewers got glimpses of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> recently with a movie based on <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s 1985 novel, `` Glitz,'' starring <PERSON> Markie </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>. In his book, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> talks about the glittery casinos thriving on bus tours that `` dropped the suckers off for six hours to lose their paychecks.'' He also describes the city's <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> neighborhood as an area that `` looked as though it had been fought over in a war, house to house, and half the people had packed up and left.'' All the attention gets mixed reviews from city fathers who take pride in the allure of their town but worry that it's being typecast. `` We do look like a perfect stage set,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have a beautiful stage set along the beachfront with the giant casinos ... but the rundown neighborhoods also seem to be an easy target.'' Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> accuses some writers of `` yellow journalism''' when it concerns <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` But that's what sells papers and books,'' he said. `` I do n't know of any Mafia in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. You know, these authors could say it took place in <LOCATION> Mayville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, but what would that mean to people? <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is one of the most designated city names in the country.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed movie, `` <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, marked the start of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s revival as a setting for moviedom and novels. That was nine years ago, barely a year after legalized gambling began. Now barely a month passes without <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> featured in some TV show, movie or book. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> has shot scenes in one casino for a story about three nightclub entertainers. The comedy-magic team of <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Teller was in the resort last spring to film `` <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Teller Get Killed.'' `` <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Weekend: A Romantic Adventure,'' was released this fall. Characters in the book by <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mourtos </PERSON> include an entrepreneur `` on the outside of society,'' a casino dealer and a mysterious nightclub dancer. Previews described the novel as `` offering insiders a view of life in the world of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s casinos ... about the temptations beneath the casinos' bright lights.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> does n't think the visions of a sleazy <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have driven away business or visitors. `` I ca n't throw rocks at the movie writers and novelists because they happen to choose us as their setting,'' he said. `` I do n't think anybody except a travel writer goes out of their way to write something positive about any particular city. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> worries more about how trade publications portray the city. `` They prefer to look at the business side of things,'' he said. `` They are more important to us, the marketers.'' <PERSON> Demaris </PERSON> said it was the lure of gambling, the big hotels and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s history as a resort that enticed him to choose it as the setting for `` Ricochet,'' a novel that promises to take `` readers straight to the heart of a world of greed, political corruption, organized crime and murder.'' Could his novel have worked in another city? `` No,'' said <PERSON> Demaris </PERSON>, `` because casino gambling is a part of it. `` I needed that atmosphere ... and I needed a kind of Mafia family like you have down there. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Mafia has gotten sort of small, it has kind of quieted down.'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> does n't think that kind of allure is bad for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` What makes <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> interesting to writers is the incredible clash of extremes. You can actually see the fortunes of people going up and down,'' he said. `` The city is far more than multimillion-dollar casinos and run-down neighborhoods. It's complicated, politically, economically and mostly historically.

<TEXT>
 The best news for fans of animated movies came with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for `` The Land Before Time'' and `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company.'' Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently, though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first weekend `` The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with $ 7.5 million in 1,395 theaters -LRB- $ 5,395 average -RRB-, and `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with $ 4 million -LRB- $ 4,226 average -RRB-. Those are big numbers, and they're likely to grow through the holiday season. That's encouraging for the animation trade, which has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but the nature of the audience. `` A large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission price,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON>, who produced `` The Land before Time.'' `` If we make a boffo with a picture, it's because we sold more tickets.'' <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON>, who formerly worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, cautiously predicts a renaissance of animation. <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, which produced `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company,'' has pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional facility at the Disney-MGM studio tour in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, is largely responsible for the revival. Four years ago when <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> helped create a new management at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, the outlook was dismal. `` Animation was dying around here,'' he said in an interview at his studio office. `` There had been 10 years of a kind of lack of faith in it, and a lack of direction to it. There were an awful lot of discouraged artists working here. `` We were finishing up ` The Black Cauldron,' which had been an enormous seven-year effort, with the kind of strange idea of doing an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of what the story was. There were a lot of people who thought we just were n't going forward with the animation department. There was even talk of getting out of the movie business entirely.'' Disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads, who were trained in live-action films, to the uniqueness of the animation process. `` First of all, it's a matter of time; ` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>,' for example, took four years to complete,'' he said. His campaign was aided by having `` The Great Mouse Detective'' in good story form. When the movie proved a hit, all doubts were erased. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company'' resulted from a `` Gong Show'' session in which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas. Most were shot down, but an updated `` Oliver Twist'' survived. Members of <PERSON> Fagin </PERSON>'s gang became dogs, as was the newcomer, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. But during story development <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> became a kitten. The young animators worked at a fast clip, inspired by the casting of the voices, including <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>. Many of the new artists have come from the Disney-endowed <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art. The studio wo n't reveal the cost of `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company,'' but <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said it was in the middle range for an animated feature -LRB- estimate: $ 18 million -RRB-. Computers will increasingly relieve some of the tedium of inking and painting, he said, helping to bring down expenses. `` But the animation of a character, hand-drawn in pencil I think will never change,'' he said. <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON>, who produced `` The Land Before Time'' for $ 12 million, found a way to reduce animation expense: He moved his entire studio to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> because of the labor cost of animation. The Irish government offered a 10-year commitment for tax breaks, grants for <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> artists who would be trained and access to bank loans, he said. `` It was like <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> leading the children of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON>. `` The artists had to pull up all their stakes; many of them sold their homes. `` Many of them have bought homes there, they all have Irish accents, some have joined the Catholic church. It's a conversion to another way of life. I do n't think many plan to stay there forever. But they have embraced the Irish society.'' <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> led an earlier exodus of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> animators during the studio's low period and produced `` The Secret of <ORGANIZATION> NIMH </ORGANIZATION>,'' a failure. Then he combined with <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> on `` An American Tail,'' a rousing success. `` The Land Before Time'' also resulted from a Spielberg idea. `` ` I ca n't understand why no one has made a film about dinosaurs,''' <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> telling him. `` ` It's a natural. There is a great interest in dinosaurs. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times, but we did n't want to do it with puppets; we tried that and it did n't work.' With <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> as executive producers, <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> could hardly miss. He admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs, but he said <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> told him: `` ` You can learn.''' <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating dinosaurs: `` For instance, the brontosaurus with the long neck. It has a little head, like a ball on a stick. It does n't have the shoulders and the hands to give you gestures. It all has to be done with facial expressions.'' But how to make the beasts move? <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> and company reasoned that the prehistoric creatures were reptiles, and birds evolved from reptilian forms. So the artists copied moves from films of chickens and turkeys. After the opening of `` The Land Before Time,'' <PERSON> Bluth </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> studio where production is under way on the next feature, `` All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' which takes place in the hereafter.

<HEAD>Male Incest Victims Just Beginning to Talk About Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At first, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s secret was small and shameful. Then it festered and grew and took on a life of its own, tormenting its keeper until it controlled his every waking hour. One day, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s secret became so ugly and overwhelming he could no longer contain it. It came out at last: how <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> had been sexually molested by an older brother who climbed into bed with him at age 9 and kept coming back for 10 years. But as terrible as it was, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s secret was only one piece of a truth far more horrifying. It was like a pebble tossed in the deep, silent pool that was his family, causing ever-widening ripples and revelations. `` About 50 of my relatives have been abused. At least, those are the ones I know about,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, 23, who asked that his full name not be used. `` It gets passed from generation to generation, and nobody talks about it, and it so it never stops.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s oldest brother, who had molested <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, had himself been molested by a favorite uncle. A female cousin had been molested by her father. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s mother had been molested by a male relative. Other cousins had been molested by their siblings, or other relatives. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was not alone as a male survivor of incest in his own family, and he is not alone in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey found that one of every 15 adult males reported having been sexually abused before the age of 18. An estimate of 15 million abused men is conservative, said therapist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>, who works with male survivors of incest at his Next Step Counseling and <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` That does n't include men who do n't remember the abuse, that does n't include men who at this point are n't able to talk about it yet, who are feeling too ashamed or too frightened,'' said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>, author of `` Victims No Longer,'' a book about recovery for male incest survivors. `` It's just beginning to be safe enough to talk about it.'' Women were the first to talk about incestuous abuse, partly because it is easier for society to accept the idea of women as victims, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> said. `` Men are n't supposed to be victims,'' he said. `` Men are supposed to be able to handle everything, to be strong, to be dominant. We do n't know what to do with a man or boy who's been victimized. We either define him as something other than a man or something less than a man, or we deny the reality of the problem.'' <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>'s personal denial lasted 25 years, until the day he discovered that the same uncle who had abused him for 12 years also had tried to molest one of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s nephews. `` I got this nephew to tell me what had happened,'' said <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, 32. `` To do that, I had to share my own experience, which was very difficult. But I did n't want him to go through what I did.'' His sister, the boy's mother, reported the uncle to the authorities, but because the abuse had merely been attempted and because it was the boy's word against the uncle's, no charges were filed. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> told his own story of abuse, which began at age 4 and lasted until he was 16, but the statute of limitations had run out. `` It was a blatant denial by the system to let this man go,'' <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> said. `` They're just waiting for him to do it again.'' When <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> went looking for support services for himself, `` to show I was not the evil one for bringing all this out,'' he found none; the only services available were for perpetrators. Two years ago, he started PLEA _ for Prevention, <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION>, Education and Assistance _ a Los Angeles-based group that offers support and information to adult male survivors of abuse who are not abusers themselves. A common misconception is that men who are sexually abused as children always become perpetrators themselves, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> said. In fact, many male incest survivors become protectors of other people. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, for example, works with the retarded. `` Many of the men who come for therapy come when they've become parents or when their children reach the age they were at when they were abused,'' <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> said. `` They come in determined that this is not going to happen to their children. They've heard the mythology that men who have been abused automatically become child abusers, and they want to make sure they wo n't abuse children.'' For many abused men, the idea of victimizing someone else is horrifying. They know firsthand the terror, guilt and pain of being a victim. They know how an abuser who is often someone a little boy mosts trusts and loves _ father, mother, brother or uncle _ can turn those emotions against the victim, filling him with guilt and self-loathing. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> tried to commit suicide twice. He used food as an escape; in his sophomore year of high school, he weighed 310 pounds. `` The biggest reason I ate so much was hoping I could become ugly to turn my brother off so he would n't touch me,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said. `` It did n't work. It just added to my problems.'' At 19, the abuse had become too much. `` I could n't stand the feeling of guilt, of shame, of hating myself for what was going on. I knew it had to stop, and I was the only one to stop it,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said. `` I got a gun illegally and kept it in my nightstand, and I swore if he touched me, I would kill him.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> has since told his parents about what happened and has confronted his brother, who denies having a problem. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>'s uncle, now in his 60s, still lives with his relatives and has access to dozens of children That makes it imperative for male incest survivors to tell their stories, <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> believes. Unless society knows that boys, too, can be incest victims, it always will be difficult for future victims to summon the courage to tell anyone about what is happening to them. Break the silence: break the cycle of abuse. `` Most of the men who call and write me say, ` I always thought I was alone.' They're in so much pain themselves, they never thought about their abuser doing it again, to someone else,'' <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> said. `` It may have happened to you, and it's in the past. But it does n't stop there.

<HEAD>San Diego Utility Accepts SoCal Edison's $2.5 Billion Buyout Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 The parent of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> entered `` the crown jewel of service territories'' when <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accepted its $ 2.5 billion buyout bid, utility officials said. The stock-swap deal approved Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E directors creates the nation's biggest public utility, and will result in lower electricity rates for customers and higher dividends for shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` We have concluded that there will be savings passed on to customers, and that this combined institution will be stronger and better able to serve customer needs,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, also chief executive of <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s unregulated parent, <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>, which serves most of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We would n't be going into this if we did n't think we could produce better consumer value than each -LRB- utility -RRB- could on its own.'' Customers of the surviving utility also will benefit from its increased financial strength through greater market competitiveness and more efficient energy transmission, <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> also has pledged to file a request for a 10 percent rate reduction for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> customers with the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> within six months of the deal's completion. The deal is expected to be consummated in late 1989 or early 1990 pending stockholder ratification and approval by federal and state regulators, principally the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> will trade 1.3 shares of its common stock for each of the 55.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E common stock. That works out to about $ 2.4 billion when calculated on <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s closing price Wednesday of $ 33 a share in composite trading. Additionally, swaps of several classes of preferred stock would add about $ 155 million to the deal, according to Rosemead-based <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s reckoning. `` What we're banking on ... is that our stock will go up in value and the dilution of <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> shareholders' -LRB- ownership in the merged company -RRB- will be made back by a higher market price-earnings ratio over time,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E's main building in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.. The deal would boost <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> past <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's biggest public utility. It would have 4.8 million customers, a service area of 54,000 square miles stretching from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> to the Mexican border, and with $ 17.7 billion in assets. Page will be named vice president of a new <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>, and he and three others from the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> utility will join the board of <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts called the offer a good one for stockholders and customers of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> company, as <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> promises the deal will boost stock dividends by 24 percent and earnings per share by 29 percent. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirello </PERSON>, who tracks the utility business for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, estimated the merged company would save $ 100 million a year in operating and maintenance costs by cutting duplication. Additionally, because the combined company would use <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>'s excess capacity <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E would not have to undertake some $ 350 million in construction to meet growing demand, he said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudakas </PERSON>, a utility analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, cautioned that the benefit to <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> stockholders was uncertain until state regulators decide how to apportion any cost savings due to operating efficiency. But <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> consumers would be almost certain winners, he said. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> made its first unsolicited bid for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> utility July 26. The price, raised twice since then, was 1.15 shares of <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> common stock for each share of <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> company initially refused to negotiate with its huge suitor, preferring to pursue a previously announced merger with <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell in early European trading today as the market waited for Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for November, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices rose. November's unemployment rate is expected to remain at about 5.3 percent. `` If it's a slightly better number, the dollar may rise a bit,'' said a dealer at a large <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. But a dealer in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said worse-than-expected figures would hurt the dollar and would indicate that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is overheating and that the threat of inflation was strong. Dealers said the dollar's weakness is partly due to the strength of the British pound. One pound cost $ 1.8542 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at midmorning, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.8480. `` The -LRB- British -RRB- government's high-interest-rate policy is clear,'' the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer said. `` Demand for the pound is there.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 121.57. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 121.65 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7318 West German marks, down from 1.7375; 1.4513 Swiss francs, down from 1.4548; 5.9135 French francs, down from 5.9327; 1.9552 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9590; 1,278.65 Italian lire, down from 1,284.97; 1.1857 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1872 Gold prices rose on the heels of higher platinum prices, bullion dealers said. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 424.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 423.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 425.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 425.00, up from $ 422.30 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold spurted ahead $ 2.90 to close at a bid $ 425.52. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.18 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $ 6.14.

 The dollar and stock prices closed lower in cautious trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today as participants awaited the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures, traders said. The dollar opened lower at 121.28 yen, then rose slightly during the day. It finished trading at 121.57 yen, down 0.28 yen from Wednesday's closing, after ranging between 121.28 and 121.60 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's decline in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed an overnight drop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> sold dollars in an attempt to keep the British pound from rising against the West German mark, dealers said. Many market players in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> remained on the sidelines ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate for November, scheduled for Friday, dealers said. The dollar rose in the afternoon after some trading companies bought the currency, but was not affected strongly, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Dollar-yen trading is likely to remain inactive in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> until at least Monday,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Monday is the first day that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> traders will be able to respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> fell back 37.44 points or 0.13 percent to 29,541.46. The index gained 94.26 points during the morning to end the early session at a record-high 29,673.16, but reversed direction in the afternoon. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index closed at a record high of 29,578.90 after gaining 260.60 points. `` Share prices began to fall as market players became increasingly cautious and directionless before the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the most immediate concern of investors was whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would raise interest rates. `` Today's directionless market was easily influenced whenever participants spread rumors, including one that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates were likely to rise,'' he added. Volume on the market's first section was an estimated 1.5 billion shares.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations may come to naught, but it has become the best sounding board around for people fed up with the seven-year deadlock over the federal budget deficit A variety of officials representing corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, labor unions and various special interest groups have paraded before the commission to raise alarms about the deficit and insist that the new administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do something. Government officials, past and present, also have lent their voices to the clamor, with many pointing to skittish financial markets as the best reason for quick action next year. On Wednesday, former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> echoed concerns raised two weeks earlier by his successor at the central bank, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said a failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence by foreigners in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments which could topple the country into a severe recession. `` We are, entirely unnecessarily in my view, undercutting the economic foundation of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> world leadership,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the commission that the need to deal with the deficit is becoming ever more urgent because the huge tide of red ink has begun to `` eat away at the foundations of our economic strength.'' Another government official, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the advisory panel Wednesday that just holding the growth of spending to the level of inflation, as has been suggested by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would not be enough to get the deficit under control. He said consideration will have to be given to raising taxes, something <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed he will not do, to go along with further cuts in government spending. `` There are no painless ways to cut spending or increase revenues,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. `` When the long-term health of our nation's economy is at stake, everything must be negotiable, including defense spending, entitlements and taxes.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> told the panel that he favors boosting the gasoline tax, saying that even if the tax were raised 50 cents per gallon over the next several years, Americans would still be paying far less for fuel than residents of most other countries. A boost in the gasoline tax was also proposed Wednesday by the Council on Competitiveness, composed of 157 chief executives from business, organized labor and higher education. The group said a combination of tax increases and spending cuts should be used to slash the deficit by $ 120 billion by 1993. The deficit in the just-completed fiscal year was $ 155.1 billion. `` The budget deficit is the nation's No. 1 economic problem,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, chairman of the council and head of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are concerned that the stability of global financial markets will continue to be shaken by a belief that the deficit is a politically intractable problem.'' The 12-member economic commission is still awaiting word on the names of the two persons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will appoint to the panel. Officials say those appointments will indicate whether the president-elect intends to use the advisory group in a serious effort to reduce the budget deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will make the appointments some time in December but he has sidestepped questions about how seriously he will take any report the panel adopts. While the group by law is scheduled to develop a deficit reduction plan by March 1, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the power to postpone the report until Sept. 1. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the panel Wednesday that he hoped it would be allowed to complete its work by March 1 so that it would have a major impact on the congressional budget deliberations. He also urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to submit his own budget plan by mid-February, incorporating any changes he considers necessary to the document <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9. `` We do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` The problems wo n't wait indefinitely while people try to read our lips or read our minds.''

 `` We have enjoyed _ are still enjoying _ an unprecedented period of economic expansion in peacetime. At the same time, there can be no dodging the facts of anemic savings, extraordinarily high current consumption, rapidly growing indebtedness internally and externally, slack growth in productivity, a depreciating currency and renewed inflation. `` Taken together, those factors undermine prospects for longterm growth and aggravate more immediate economic risks, but they also undercut public and congressional support for sustaining our military strength, maintaining open markets and free flows of international investment, and for efforts to encourage development of much poorer nations.''

 `` Another example of failing to reflect costs is the defense budget.

The simple fact is that our defense plans do not yet reflect the limits on what is affordable. `` Closely related to this is the problem of our aging nuclear weapons complex. We estimate that it will cost $ 100 billion to $ 130 billion over a number of years to clean up and modernize these environmentally hazardous plants.''

 `` If a formula for substantial deficit-reduction on the spending side alone remains as elusive to the administration, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as it has to us, then we expect all parties will consider revenue increases. `` As a group concerned about capital formation and private sector investment, we agree that it is important to pay for federal spending through revenues rather than borrowing.

 The government should spend $ 30 billion next year to close the nation's 100 worst savings institutions and stop more than $ 1 billion a month in losses, a top bank regulator says. `` We need to close the worst first,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said in a speech Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> `` Once these 100 or so worst institutions are liquidated, the other problem institutions can be dealt with over a somewhat longer period,'' he said, outlining the conclusions of an <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> study that will be published within two weeks. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> joins former presidents <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in arguing that it will be cheaper in the long run to spend heavily now to close failing savings and loan institutions. His recommendation is an implicit criticism of the approach taken so far by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is technically insolvent and lacks the cash to pay off depositors or make good on all S & amp; L losses. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has `` resolved'' the cases of 147 S & amp; Ls, most through rescues put together with guarantees and promissory notes committing money it does not have now but expects to receive over the next 30 years. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency insures deposits in commercial banks, not S & amp; Ls, said he does not oppose allowing an institution to remain open if it is economically viable, but that the losses should be cleaned up immediately and not allowed to continue. `` He's saying that they should have had more money and they should have closed more institutions,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, said, `` All we can do is play with the hand we've been dealt and that hand provides us with certain resources. ... This Congress and this administration have to determine where we go from here.'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> did not directly call for a taxpayer bailout, but said `` government resources'' must be used because even the first $ 30 billion of what is estimated to be a $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion problem is beyond the capacity of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry to pay. However, he said several methods could be used to keep most of the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> rescue `` off budget,'' providing a large sum quickly but spreading the fiscal drain over several years. One method involves selling bonds and having the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> pay the interest. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the largest industry lobby group, said even if the bank board received $ 30 billion next year, it would be difficult to spend it efficiently. `` I have a question as to whether they can move that quickly,'' he said. `` It would be wonderful if they could, but I'm not convinced.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> also examined the broader issue of deposit insurance. Both the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> guarantee deposits up to $ 100,000. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said deposit insurance is needed because it prevents bank runs that could bring down the entire financial system. Suggestions from academics that deposit insurance be scrapped or reduced are impractical, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, but he offered several ideas to keep the government's liabilities from mounting: _ Taking deposit insurance agencies out of the federal budget so they are less subject to political pressure _ Giving the insurance funds the power to raise the fee charged to member institutions after bad years and, eventually, perhaps the power to charge individual institutions different fees based on their records _ Speeding up the process for revoking an institution's insurance from two years to six months _ Making solvent banks owned by holding companies responsible for the losses of other banks held by the same parent _ Establishing regional committees of regulators and bankers to evaluate whether institutions are overly exposed to risk in one region or one sector of the economy, such as oil drilling

<TEXT>
 Local telephone rates are going up today, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance prices are going down, soon to be followed by those of rivals <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. This script has been replayed several times in recent years as part of an effort by federal regulators to shift the costs of the local phone network to local customers. For about half of all customers, long-distance price cuts of 38 percent since 1984 have more than offset the rise in local rates, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Those in the other half, however, do n't call long-distance enough to benefit. Instead, their overall bill is higher. Beginning today, customers will see another 60 cents added to their monthly local phone bill, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will drop its basic interstate long-distance rates an average of 3.8 percent. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> said it will drop its rates Jan. 1 an average 3.85 percent, about the same for business as for residential customers. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> expects to announce details of a price cut next month. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is able to make its $ 697 million annual reduction, and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> theirs, because costs of connecting to the local network are being reduced by the corresponding increase in customers' monthly bills. With today's 60-cent increase, the subscriber line charge has risen to $ 3.20. The federal charge, imposed in 1985, is designed to reduce the subsidy long-distance companies pay to maintain the local network. A customer who makes about $ 5.20 per month in direct-dialed long-distance calls saves enough to offset the effects of the line charge, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lande </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s industry analysis division, `` About half the people are at least breaking even,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> will cut its basic long-distance rates for calls traveling more than 124 miles by 3.8 percent. It will make smaller cuts in rates for interstate calls of shorter distances, which account for about one-quarter of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T interstate calls. The largest among the price cuts will go to large volume users, both residential and business. Rates for Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s long-distance calling plan for residential customers, will be cut 4.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> rates will drop 4 percent and the company will restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and distance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This price reduction is to take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the others. Rates for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's three <ORGANIZATION> PRO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> calling plans for business customers will be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates will drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates will go down 4.5 percent. Basic <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T 800 service prices will go down 3.6 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rates will see an overall reduction of 6.2 percent.

<HEAD>Illinois Dealer Argues Jury Was `Hostile' To Odometer Tampering</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> auto dealer who turned back the mileage of used cars he sold was the victim `` of the jury's hostility toward odometer tampering,'' his lawyer told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in arguing that the dealer's mail fraud conviction was excessive `` The only fraud here was odometer tampering,'' attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told the court Wednesday, saying that dealer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuck </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, should have been convicted of misdemeanor rather than felony counts. <PERSON> Schmuck </PERSON>, who did business as <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was accused in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> of altering the mileage readings of the cars to increase their value. The charges stemmed from cars sold wholesale to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> auto dealers. Courts have held that mail fraud charges can be brought in cases where the mail is necessary to the success of odometer tampering schemes. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who practices in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, also said a federal district judge in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> erred by refusing to advise jurors they could have considered finding Schmuck guilty of a lesser offense. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said his client should have been found guilty of odometer tampering, a misdemeanor punishable by a $ 50,000 fine and a year in prison. Instead he was convicted in December 1983 of 12 counts of mail fraud, a federal felony carrying a maximum penalty of a $ 1,000 fine, five years' imprisonment or both, and later was sentenced to 90 days in jail and four years' probation. `` We were the victims of the jury's hostility toward odometer tampering,'' he said. `` The feeling was: ` He's certainly guilty. We have to convict him of something.''' `` We would have been happy to take 12 counts of odometer tampering,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` It's a misdemeanor. The fine is $ 50,000. That's 50 times worse than mail fraud, but it's only a year in prison.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said his client did not use the mails, and instead hand-delivered paperwork making false mileage statements on the cars he sold to unsuspecting auto dealers. Retail customers who bought the cars from the dealerships then would mail title and registration papers to the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, and the lawyer said it was sending those documents which constituted fraudulent use of the mails. `` Is every person who tampers with an odometer going to be guilty of mail fraud when someone on down the line mails in a registration?'' he asked. `` You have to be able to point out how the mailing contributed to the success of the scheme,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise you open the flood gate for prosecutions.'' Attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an assistant to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Solicitor General, argued that <PERSON> Schmuck </PERSON> could not operate a fraudulent business successfully for two years without using the mails, since his customers would not buy cars unless they could be registered. `` The sale can not be made without the title being sent to the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> transportation </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` The sale was made. The dealers came back for more.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to rule on the case sometime next year.

<HEAD>Dual Pipeline Plan For Pumping Canadian Natural Gas To Northeast

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal official says he approved plans to build two major pipelines to deliver Canadian natural gas throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> because of `` an urgent and necessary requirement'' for the additional energy supplies. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief administrative law judge at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also said Wednesday that timing was critical because the Canadian gas would be lost to other markets if the projects were delayed. The plan calls for the construction of a 369.4-mile pipeline from the U.S.-Canadian border near <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and ending at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where it will be connected with existing pipeline from the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Another section of the Iroquois project would be a 53.2-mile pipeline loop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and a third section near <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The second project, the Champlain pipeline, would be a 339.3-mile stretch from the Canadian border near <LOCATION> Philipsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, through <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, ending near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Medway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The settlement ... is clearly in the public interest,'' he wrote `` There is an urgent and necessary requirement for additional supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of individuals and the economy in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> areas at the earliest possible date.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> recommended the full commission approve the plan, which involves eight companies. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-Allen </PERSON> said the earliest vote would be Jan. 11. Eight companies are involved in the projects.

<HEAD>MIT Moves To Commercialize New Superconductors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> has won an early heat in a race to commercialize new superconductors that many scientists believe will eventually be used to probe the brain, detect submarines and help find oil. But researchers at other university and corporate laboratories said Wednesday the race, which could bring huge financial gains to the winner, is far from over. <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> received a `` notice of allowability'' from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> last week for the first major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent in the field of high-temperature superconductors, materials that conduct electricity with virtually no resistance. MIT officials said the notice is a strong signal that the institute will receive a patent within a few months for a process developed by two professors, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurek </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sande </PERSON>, to make ceramic superconductors more flexible by mixing them with metals like gold or silver. Researchers around the world have been competing to develop and apply ceramic superconductors since they were discovered in January 1986 by two scientists at an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> scientists, <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednorz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, won the 1987 Nobel Prize in physics for their discovery that certain ceramics become superconductive when cooled with liquid nitrogen to about 300 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Previous superconductors had operated only at minus 418 degrees or below, requiring cooling in liquid helium, which is more costly and difficult to maintain than liquid nitrogen. One problem with the ceramics is that they are brittle. <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> says its process greatly increases flexibility, allowing the materials to be made into wire and wound into coils for small motors. Several other applications for patents related to ceramic superconductors are pending, but none have been granted, said <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Maston </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION> and other companies and universities are working on processes similar to <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON>, director of physical research at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> technique is significant in that it's one of the earliest,'' <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON> said, `` but it's still too early to tell which, if any, of these processes is going to result in a commercial application. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, manager of exploratory cryogenics at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s research center in <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said researchers can easily foresee using the new superconductors in devices to measure brainwaves, locate submarines deep under the sea, detect oil reserves and process radar signals But those uses are probably at least five years away, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, and many problems with superconductors will have to be solved first. Among them, he said, are limits to the amount of current the new materials can carry. <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> said it has licensed exclusive rights to its patent to a company founded last year by four of the institute's faculty members. <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to disclose the terms of the licensing agreement with the company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>China Delays Opening of First Futures Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will delay for a year the opening of the socialist world's first futures market, an official daily said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said a futures market will be launched on a trial basis in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province by the end of next year. In May, plans were announced to open a market in the southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> by the end of 1988, but the daily said an investigative group under the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, decided to put off the starting date. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, senior researcher in the group, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wanted more time to learn from experts in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and become better prepared. A futures market, formerly regarded in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a form of capitalist speculation, allows traders and producers of raw materials to negotiate a set price for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future date. The producer is guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent fluctuations in the market. The need for futures markets has arisen with the decontrol of prices for many commodities that has resulted in sharp price fluctuations. Produce markets in particular have been plagued by gluts and shortages caused by farmers' inability to forecast the market. The daily said the market in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, a major agriculture center, will deal in wheat and other grains. About 150 people, mostly from <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, recently gathered in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a 10-day training course in futures markets, it said. The <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> market will only open prices to trading twice a week because of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backward telecommunications system, it said. If it is a success, markets will be opened in <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> in the northeast for corn, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in the west for pigs and <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> in the south and north for raw materials. It said the investigative group is studying whether foreign businessmen will be allowed to participate in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s futures markets. Initially, only Chinese will be able to take part, it said.

<NOTE>EDs: Subs 17th graf, The leading, to reflect revisions for earlier

<TEXT>
 The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in October after falling a month earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators had previously been estimated as falling only 0.1 percent in September, but today's report revised that downturn to minus 0.3 percent. Economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing to slower growth, but they have been hard-pressed to find much sign of it yet. Other statistics for October, the latest available, all look very strong. Unemployment is at a 14-year low, factories are using more of their capacity than at any time in 8 -LCB- years and personal income posted its steepest increase in a year. `` The message is clear that the fourth quarter is starting out very well. ... There are no particular imbalances ... -LRB- and -RRB- that suggests the economy should keep on expanding nicely for another six to nine months,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. However, the leading index is `` clearly signaling a slowdown'' in the second half of next year, he said in advance of today's report. Over the last 12 months, it's risen only 0.5 percent, compared with a gain of 6.0 percent for the previous 12-month period. It was the smallest October-to-October increase since 1979-80, beore the last recession. In October, four of nine available indicators were pointing to faster growth, while five were pointing to slower growth. The factors pushing the index up, in order of magnitude, were an increase in building permits, a rise in stock prices, a jump in new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial claims for state unemployment insurance. The negative factors, ordered from largest to smallest, were faster deliveries to companies, a sign of slackening demand; a drop in the price of industrial materials; a decline in the inflation-adjusted money supply; a shortening in the length of the average workweek, and a fall in orders for business equipment. The various changes left the index at 193.0 percent of its 1967 base of 100. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the index's prediction of slower growth is not necessarily false. Some sort of moderation, given the current bouyancy, is not unlikely in the last half of 1989, he said. `` However, I would not leap to the conclusion that a recession is coming,'' he said. Given current economic conditions, a significant slowdown or recession wo n't occur until the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> pushes interest rates sharply higher, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, fearing that too-strong demand will push prices higher, has been trying to slow expansion of the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, to a non-inflationary 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The GNP grew at a moderate 2.6 percent annual pace in the third quarter, down from a 3.2 percent pace in the first half of 1988. However, most analysts were expecting it to pick up again in the first three months of next year when the negative effects from the summer drought are no longer acting as a drag. That would put the economy well into the middle of its seventh year of expansion, a peacetime record. The leading index, before falling in September, rose 0.5 percent in August and fell 0.8 percent in July. It rose 1.6 percent in June and dropped 0.7 percent in May. Economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row. However, it has also falsely predicted a recession four times. Preliminary estimates of the index are often revised substantially in later months. For instance, declines were initially reported for five consecutive months _ from September 1987 through January _ but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops.

<HEAD>Philippine Lawsuit A Smokescreen, Westinghouse Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says safety concerns raised by the Aquino government over a nuclear reactor in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> amount to a smokescreen to disguise political opposition to the project begun by former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they expected the lawsuit over the $ 2.3 billion plant, for which the company has been paid $ 680 million as prime contractor. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> claims it is due another $ 20 million to $ 30 million. The government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> announced early today that it had sued <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to cancel the contract for the 620-megawatt plant, which was finished three years ago but was never started. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said today it petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to arbitrate the dispute as provided by the 1976 contract. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> nuclear fuels unit, and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> Deputy General Counsel <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briskman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials have acknowledged during private talks that no matter how safe the plant is, they do n't intend to allow nuclear power production in the country. `` It has nothing to do with safety,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. The government says the plant, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> province, is unsafe partly because of its design and its location on an earthquake fault and near a volcano. The reactor's opponents also allege bribes were paid over the awarding of the prime contract for the plant. `` What we're finding here are the results of a political policy that came to life when they were running for office,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. `` They now feel they have a political albatross around their neck and they're trying to blame us.'' President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s legal adviser, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, said in late October that the suit was ready and likely would be filed within a month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In addition, a standstill agreement barring either the government or the company from taking legal action expired today. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials said the 10-year-old controversy is an unfounded attack on the company's international standing as a designer and builder of nuclear power plants. `` All over the world we have built plants, and we have n't had this problem. If they do n't want to operate this plant, that's their decision, but do n't make <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> a scapegoat,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> will not be a scapegoat.'' The company cites investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which produced no evidence to warrant charges. A safety study commissioned by the Aquino government _ a draft of which was published by a trade journal _ concluded the plant is safe, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said. But the government says the final report concludes otherwise, although <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials have refused to release the document. Communist rebels have bombed the transmission towers leading from the plant, and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap, <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> said. The plant's corps of operators has largely disbanded, and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has only a handful of employees still in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, he said. Furthermore, the cost of the plant continues rising, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said. Interest on the loans the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government took to build the plant cost an estimated $ 300,000 per day.

 Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits owner <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> today extended the deadline on his offer for <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saying he did so to get time to put out a court-ordered statement. He also said that, since announcing his buyout plans, he has been offered 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the 35.97 million shares outstanding. He already owned 3.2 percent of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio-based </LOCATION> company's stock, so the stock tendered by Nov. 30 would give him nearly 44 percent, said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepardson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> The previous deadline for the takeover bid had been midnight EST on Wednesday, but <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement today that it had put off the deadline until midnight EST on Dec. 16. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> has forbidden Popeyes to buy Church's stock until 10 working days after it reveals information on which its buyout offer is made. He also ordered Popeyes on Tuesday to stop using, at least for now, any confidential Church's information it may have Church's claims its former chief financial officer took confidential files with him when he went to work for <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. Church's announced Tuesday that it was starting preliminary negotiations with third parties that it did not identify. `` We do not understand how you can adequately explore alternatives available to Church's without allowing us to participate in such discussions on equal footing with all other interested parties,'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> wrote the board late Wednesday. The letter said that so far, Church's has said it will talk to <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and let him see the documents he wants only if he signs a standstill agreement. Such agreements bind the potential buyer to a promise not to pursue the takeover attempt for a specific period, usually years. Such an agreement is unnecessary, <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s letter said, because he is willing to sign a confidentiality agreement requiring that any further purchases of stock be made pursuant to the tender offer. The letter also said <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> plans to go forward with his offer after complying with <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>' order. And he repeated that he is willing to raise his $ 290 million, $ 8-per-share bid, if the nonpublic information he wants justifies a higher price.

 The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takeover war ended in stunning triumph for buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose record $ 24.53 billion agreement derailed a fatter rival bid by the management group that triggered the corporate free-for-all more than a month ago. The $ 109-a-share offer approved by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors late Wednesday capped a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left the unprecedented auction for the nation's 19th largest industrial company in utter confusion. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 81 in cash, $ 18 in stock and additional securities worth $ 10 beat out a last-minute offer valued at $ 112 a share, or $ 25.2 billion, by chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s management group. Although the face value of the management offer looked higher, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stated that its board of directors concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer was worth substantially the same. `` The Board of Directors of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, by unanimous vote of all directors present, adopted the <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> offer as being in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was pleased with the decision that ended the biggest takeover brawl in history. The value of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was nearly double that of the previous record, a $ 13.4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in March 1984. `` We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so that the employees of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, its consumers and suppliers and the communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return to normal and stability will be restored,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two principals, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s triumph raised the prospect that at least some businesses in one of the biggest consumer product companies might be sold to help the investment firm pay for the acquisition. It gave no indication what, if any, of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide operations might be for sale. But there was speculation that possible candidates included some or even all of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s food segments, which would return the company to the tobacco business roots that still account for about 40 percent of its sales. Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer products companies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. It makes well-known brands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal to Life Savers candy. The size and complexity of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> deal has raised major questions about the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and other debt-financed restructurings that are transforming much of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and whether it has gone too far. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 12.6 billion Still pending are multibillion-dollar battles over <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest poultry processor; and textile maker <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> deal also signaled a spectacular defeat by its chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose management group began the takeover struggle Oct. 20 with a $ 75 a share offer that was later raised five times. His tenure at the company remained uncertain. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> would install <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s former chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sticht </PERSON>, in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition. The newspaper said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> would move the company's corporate headquarters back to <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. It also was n't clear as of late Wednesday whether <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a scrappy, daring adversary, would try to reopen what already has proven to be an extremely unpredictable battle. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted him in today's editions as saying, `` I am proud of the fact that we put the best bid on the table the first time and this time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s key financial partners, said in a statemet today, `` From what we know, our bid was the best. We are mystified about the process and the standards that the board used to reach its decision. We are going to continue to keep our options open.'' Earlier in the day Wednesday, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group made an effort to raise its bid after a company-decreed deadline for all offers had expired. The move temporarily upended a $ 106-a-share, $ 23.8 billion <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer that the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> board was about to approve. That development made the already unwieldy auction even more chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were getting equal treatment. It also sent <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock $ 2.25 higher Wednesday in frenzied <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading to $ 93 a share, on the possibility the auction would be prolonged. In early trading today, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> was off 75 cents to $ 92.25 a share. Sources familiar with the bidding said the offer of a third contender, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was rejected as too tentative, although the bidder valued it as high as $ 115 a share or $ 25.87 billion. A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash eang homes, said the report `` is misleading _ it is going to confuse the public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard. But <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Nursing Home Reform, said: `` We think the national statistics are misleading Conditions are worse.''

<HEAD>Leading Index Up Slightly In October</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to update with construction spending
report; picks up 2nd graf pvs, ``The Commerce...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending rose 0.9 percent, its heftiest increase in three months, with widespread gains reported in housing, government and commercial building, the government reported today. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity rose a tiny 0.1 percent in October after falling a month earlier. Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion in October following a 0.7 percent increase in September and a 0.2 percent rise in August. It was the best showing since a 1.5 percent jump in July. But despite the recent increases, construction activity has been modest this year, advancing 2.1 percent in the past 12 months. Taking a 1.7 percent rise in construction costs into account, activity increased only 0.4 percent over the past 12 months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators had previously been estimated as falling only 0.1 percent in September, but today's report revised that downturn to minus 0.3 percent. The leading index, before edging down in September, rose 0.5 percent in August and fell 0.7 percent in July after dropping in May. Economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing to slower growth, but they have been hard-pressed to find much sign of it lately. Other statistics for October, the latest available, have been strong, including one showing unemployment at a 14-year low. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that personal income increased 1.8 percent, the biggest rise since October 1987, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.18 trillion last month. The gain followed modest increases of 0.5 percent in September and 0.4 percent in August. The numbers raised some concerns about inflation, but a separate report to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> indicated the economy was slowing down. In a review of the economy based on assessments from the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported `` an apparently slower pace'' of growth, moderate wage increases and slightly eased price pressures in several manufacturing industries. Financial markets rallied, interpreting the report as a signal that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> members were less worried about inflation than previously thought, and therefore less likely to boost interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 12.98 to 2,114.51, giving the well-known barometer a gain of nearly 40 points over the past three sessions. The government attributed about half of last month's increase in income to farm subsidy payments and bonuses to auto workers. However, excluding those factors, income still would have risen a hefty 0.9 percent. `` This throws cold water on the view the economy slowed down much,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` It may have taken a bit of a pause in August and September, but it came roaring back in October.'' The concern in financial markets has been that growth is too strong. High levels of employment will lead to higher wages, and strong consumer demand will lead to higher prices, they fear. Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, was up a robust 0.8 percent to an annual rate of $ 3.30 trillion following a weak 0.1 percent rise in September. The biggest spending increase last month was for services, up 1.4 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for non-durable goods. Spending on durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, fell 0.6 percent. With income rising faster than spending, Americans saved more than in any month since October 1987. The personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 5.2 percent, up from 4.2 percent in September. Disposable, or after-tax income, was up 1.9 percent last month, also the largest increase in a year, after rising 0.6 percent a month earlier.

<TEXT>
 Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today extended for a second time its $ 1.4 billion tender offer for Georgia-based <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The offer was to expire at midnight Wednesday, but a <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> statement said it was being extended by one week to midnight EST Dec. 7. The company also announced that a preliminary count showed about 11.4 million shares of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s common stock had been tendered by stockholders as of the close of business Wednesday. With the shares <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> already owns, that would give the company about 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, it said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> officials have declined to say how much of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> company's stock they hope to acquire. `` We are pleased with the results of the tender offer to date, and believe they reflect the shareholders' increasing interest and confidence in our proposal to acquire <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman of the Chicago-based company. `` We are confident our offer will succeed, despite the efforts by <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> management to impede it.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s stock was up $ 1.12 -LCB- a share to $ 40 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, the Chicago-based maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear, originally set Nov. 21 as the deadline for its $ 48-per-share offer for the textile company based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. The deadline was extended to midnight Wednesday as <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> attempted to overcome some of the anti-takeover obstacles set up by <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> have done battle in court over <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan, designed to thwart hostile takeovers Last week, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s motion to reinstate certain key provisions of the plan, which were thrown out earlier by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. The appeals court scheduled a hearing the week of Jan. 9 to determine the final fate of the `` poison pill'' plan. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer is contingent on getting the plan overturned. Also being argued in the courts is the constitutionality of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statute, which <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> is seeking to overturn. That issue is now in the hands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who has not set a hearing date. If the law is upheld, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s bid can not go through.

 The `` Miracle on 34th Street'' is more than just a movie to postal workers who have borrowed the slogan to describe how thousands of people are helped each year when they write to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. `` Over the past years, we've had a number of startling successes,'' said Postmaster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, noting that families have been reunited through the letters and one person received an eye operation. `` Every year, we kind of have a miracle on 34th Street here.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s main post office is a massive neo-classical building on Eighth Avenue with its north side on 34th Street. The post office kicked off this year's campaign Wednesday, although 4,000 of an expected 18,000 letters to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> from the less fortunate around the world have already been received. Last year, more than 16,000 letters to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> from about 10 countries, many addressed to the North Pole and bearing a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> zip code, ended up at the main post office's dead letter unit. Good Samaritans answered about 14,000 of them, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> postal employees, with the public's help, have been granting Christmas wishes for 60 years. `` I do n't believe in you, but my teacher says I have to write you a letter anyway,'' confessed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, who lives in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> welfare hotel. `` For Christmas, could you please bring my mother a coat? ... My teacher gave her one, but it did n't fit.'' `` My husband is a junkie and he left us with nothing,'' wrote a mother of three in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` So I left him and moved in with my mom and dad. It's embarrassing enough that I ca n't afford to get my kids anything.'' `` I budget for one meal a day,'' said a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> woman who is raising three children and a grandchild on a salary of $ 2.35 an hour. `` It drives me crazy sometimes and I feel like the world wants to come down.'' `` We do n't vouch for the exact accuracy or need,'' said <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, but he feels most of the letters are legitimate. About 25 grade-school children, many of them welfare hotel residents, chatted with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> during a news conference to launch the volunteer drive. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 9, said she wanted `` a baby girl'' for Christmas. `` Santa does n't give baby girls. We can give you a baby doll, though,'' he replied jovially. `` Lose some weight,'' advised <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 8, but <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> said he could n't make such a promise. Volunteers can get letters to answer by calling, writing or going to the main post office. The 1947 film `` Miracle on 34th Street'' tells the story of a lawyer who proves the existence of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> using as evidence the bags and bags of letters the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> delivered to him. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> in question worked at <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> department store, which also is on 34th Street in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened modestly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with most of the selling due to technical factors, analysts said. `` The market seems to be pretty fickle right now,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But some observers also linked the decline to recurring rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may delay offering subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviets have agreed to purchase 9 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain, including 4 million tons of wheat, this year and next year under an agreement signed Monday. The Soviets have purchased no wheat for delivery in the current marketing year and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not offered them wheat since the signing of the grain deal, as the agency had been expected to do. In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.20 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $ 2.60 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.94 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 5 \ cents lower with January at $ 7.60 a Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent higher with January at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 40.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 44.75 cents a pound. Cattle futures closed mostly lower on Wednesday while pork futures were mostly higher.

 The stock market drifted mostly lower today as investors awaited the November employment statistics due to be released Friday for an indication of the strength of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, was down 4.27 at 2,110.24 at noon on Wall Street. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 5 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 528 up, 752 down and 504 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 59.89 million shares at noontime compared with 60.78 million shares at the same point in Wednesday's session The market rallied in the previous session on indications that the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace. That presumably would mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher interest rates to restrain growth and inflation. But the market was looking toward Friday's report on November employment for confirmation of economic growth trends. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said today's decline in prices reflected `` some precautionary selling on the part of traders who do n't want to be caught long if the employment figures are negative. He said the consensus estimate calls for payroll growth of about 250,000 and said that a number above 275,000 `` would be disappointing'' because it would increase pressure on the central bank to encourage higher interest rates. Rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields on fixed-income investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills relatively more attractive compared with the riskier returns on stocks. In a new report today, the government said its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in October after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in September. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 \ at 91 -RCB- and was the most active stock this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> The company said late Wednesday it had accepted an offer of $ 109 a share in cash and securities from buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, spurning a competing offer from a management group. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was also active.

 <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay nearly $ 15 million to settle two lawsuits filed by shareholders against the $ 3.6 billion management buyout of the company, according to documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

 More than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness, according to the federal government's first consumer guide to nursing homes, released today. The survey also found that more than one-fourth of the nursing homes do not administer drugs properly. However, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that compiled and released the statistics, cautioned against reading more into the figures than is warranted. `` This is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around the country,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> told reporters. He said the `` met-unmet'' criteria for each of the 32 categories included in the state-by-state reports contains no measure of severity and represented a one-time `` snapshot'' of conditions at the nursing home's most recent unannounced inspection. To some degree, he said, it relied on the subjective judgment of the inspector. At the same time, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> defended release of the report against industry criticism that it would mislead consumers. One complaint was, for example, that a nursing home might be given an `` unmet'' mark on proper administration of medication if one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine. `` If one person was five minutes late, I'm sure they would not have been dinged in the survey,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said. `` What we're looking at, what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time. `` We are not in the business of making arbitrary, bureaucratic judgments. We are trying to evaluate what is really happening to people in that nursing home.'' He added: `` What we are looking for ... is not nursing home providers that barely scrape by. We're looking for people who are good providers, consistently, over time, 365 days a year. And I have to believe that if that's where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home, they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial point.'' The 75-volume guide shows how each of the 15,000 nursing homes fared on 32 health, safety and care standards based on periodic inspections by state agencies. About 2,400 of the 15,000 received passing marks in all 32 categories. The report had been scheduled for release next week, but copies were distributed earlier to various state and local agencies, as well as to consumer groups. When the embargo was broken, <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> issued the massive guide immediately. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said all the information had been available at the state level if people had `` been willing to work hard enough to get it'' but that <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> felt it was worthwile to compile it in a single report. According to the survey, nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to meet sanitary standards for food. Almost 30 percent failed to meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness and 29 percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors' orders. However, the report also said that only a small percentage of the nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories. Overall among skilled homes, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in only 10 categories. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 9,000 nursing homes, said the report `` is misleading _ it is going to confuse the public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard. But <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Nursing Home Reform, said: `` We think the national statistics are misleading Conditions are worse.''

<TEXT>
 The British upper-classes got a tart reminder the other day of how far they've fallen on the ladder of national priorities. It came in a speech by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, environment secretary in the Conservative government, and concerned one of the very pillars of British aristocracy _ the stately home. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 22, <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> delivered a blunt message on these lines: if you ca n't afford the upkeep of your stately home, do n't ask the government for help; sell it to the `` nouveaux riches.'' The speech, which brought ripples of reproach from the landed gentry, was another sign of how the old <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been transformed. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, once topheavy with squires and knights of the shires, today is peopled with the likes of <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, a civil engineer, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the daughter of a chemist and a grocer. Things have changed drastically since 1938, when <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> wrote: `` The stately homes of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> How beautiful they stand To prove the upper classes Still have the upper hand.'' The post-World War II <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government, intent on fostering socialist egalitarianism, imposed massive taxation on inherited wealth, forcing many owners to turn their stately homes over to the public. The homes became museums, while the owners moved into small corners of the estate. By one estimate, the number of major stately homes occupied by one family shrank from 10,000 to 2,000. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> recalled the days when governments, to preserve historic mansions for the nation, had to pay `` simply to keep roofs on and walls standing.'' But after a decade of Thatcherism, he said, `` Things have changed. Everywhere we see the new prosperity. Millionaires abound and there are many more budding ones called yuppies.'' Yet he was still hearing `` cries from some quarters for more, rather than less state help.'' That, he said, was out. `` There have to be some opportunities for today's nouveaux riches, so I am not impressed by the case of the anciens pauvres,'' he said. Nor was he impressed by noble lineages. `` Many families who pride themselves on having always lived in a house in fact married into it, bought it or stole it at some point in their murky history, when they were robber barons, property speculators or simply won the pools.'' <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>'s blunt talk drew some testy responses. Right-wing commentator <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruton </PERSON> suggested that as the second son of noble family, <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, 59, suffered from the British affliction of `` younger son syndrome'' _ a resentment born of primogeniture, whereby the first-born inherits the title and estate, while the others must fend for themselves. In the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees-Milne </PERSON> called <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>'s remarks `` totally unwarranted,'' arguing that stately families were doing a service to conservation by staying on their land. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery-Massingberd </PERSON>, author of a guide to British country houses, says the problem is not with the larger homes, which can easily be turned into money-spinning public attractions, but the smaller homes, whose owners are hard-pressed to survive. `` The families that are still in their homes have a lot of influence and do a lot of good,'' he said in an interview. They feel greater responsibility for their tenant farmers and hold unpaid public posts like high sheriff and justice of the peace. `` I wonder whether the nouveaux riches, who use these places as weekend pads to impress their friends, would be willing to take on these responsibilities,'' he said. Also, he said, the attraction of country homes is their valuable furnishings, historic collections that risk being broken up and sold off by new owners lacking a sense of heritage. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Empson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> spoke, said homeowners had already proved ingenious at fending for themselves, turning their estates into conference centers, safari parks and even `` war games parks'' for adventurous executives. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>'s exhortations might apply to smaller homes within commuting distance of the cities, he said in an interview. `` But if you have a historic home on a palatial scale deep in the countryside, I do n't see millionaire yuppies queuing round the block to buy it. The market just is n't there.''

 His name is not as familiar as chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> or buyout specialist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, but as the key decisionmaker in history's largest corporate takeover, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> held the fate of both dealmakers in his hands. The 60-year-old <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> is chairman and chief executive officer of his own $ 3 billion company, <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>. But he also serves as non-executive chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and head of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s five-member special directors' committee In the latter role, he was responsible for choosing a winner in the nation's biggest and wildest corporate bidding war, which produced an apparent triumph for <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and his buyout firm, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday. <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>'s much-revised bid of $ 24.53 billion for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was chosen over a competing offer from a Johnson-led management group. In the eye of the hurricane whipped up by the bidding stood the unassuming <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>, who is described by those who know him as an innovative businessman who quietly tackles goals that some will only talk about. For instance, he was one of the first American businessmen to negotiate a major deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In June, Combustion Engineering announced it had reached an agreement to help build and manage a multibillion-dollar petrochemical complex in two Western Siberian cities. It was the company's second deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in six months. <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> also has previous experience in the merger and acquisition wars as a director of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, Conn.-based financial services giant sold earlier this year to <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $ 1.65 billion. A former executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and former president of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> was regarded as neutral in the <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> battle because he is `` non-executive chairman,'' which means he is not an employee of the company. When he took the <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> post, he became the only Fortune 500 company chairman also serving as chief executive officer and chairman of another major firm. The role of his special committee was critical to the future of the Atlanta-based food and tobacco conglomerate. The committee was criticized by some on Wall Street for adding to the confusion of the bidding process by extending the deadline for bids to Nov. 29. And even then, the deadline proved meaningless, since both principal bidders upped their offers well after the time limit. But for <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> and the committee it was a finely calculated risk. By extending the bidding, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> hoped to maximize the offers for the company _ and the return to shareholders. While deadlines were abused, the extensions may have spared the company some future litigation from shareholders complaining they did n't get the best deal possible. Still, the one goal that eluded <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> was orderliness. The auction was confused and rife with personality clashes to the end. And in a final, cruel twist of fate, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> and the committee decided to spurn their own management team, led by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, in favor of the outside buyout specialists. Raised by a single mother during the Depression, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> served a stint in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and started at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> as a student engineer. He said teamwork is a key part of his management philosophy. `` I worked at AT & amp; T for 30 years and at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, you learn how to delegate to good people and how to build teamwork,'' he said in a recent interview. A business associate said he is sure <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>'s experience was an asset at the negotiating table while the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> deal was being worked out. `` He is a very practical businessman and a hard worker,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` If he has a goal he gets it. ... <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> was the first in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with this size contract with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He was very persistent and he finally got it.'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> is `` straightforward,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said. `` If he says something, you can bank on it.'' Several Wall Street analysts declined to talk about <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> during the RJR negotiations. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was critical of <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>'s management of Combustion Engineering. `` He's running CE into the ground,'' the analyst said. `` The costs are out of sight. He's getting his comeuppance. `` I think he ought to stay in CE more,'' he said. `` It's tough enough to run one company well. ... He's spending his time handling <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>.'' Combustion Engineering _ which builds and services power-generating systems for utilities, supplies equipment to chemical and refining industries and operates waste-to-energy plants _ recently announced a loss of $ 62.9 million in its revised nine-month results. The company said the results were due to increases in estimated costs to complete its waste-to-energy plants, cost overruns and repair costs. Despite those problems, some analysts predict improvement in the company's fortunes next year. Combustion Engineering is in the process of selling off $ 285 million in assets and will be able to use the cash to reduce its debt and interest expenses. With low demand for new power plants, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> has steered the company in the direction of maintenance and service, where revenues are expected to grow. <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> has been upbeat about his business decisions in the past. In the 1987 annual report, he told <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> shareholders that the company had `` made considerable progress'' toward becoming a `` new and different'' company. <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> is also a member of the boards of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the board of trustees of <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, his alma mater.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ When $ 2 billion from the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hits <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, the people who sell jewels, cars and houses for a living hope to be busy. Analysts estimate that 9,000 people in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, former headquarters of the food and tobacco giant, own $ 1 billion worth of stock in the company, and that local trusts, foundations and retirement plans own another $ 1 billion. The estimates are based on a stock price of $ 100 a share. The company was auctioned off Wednesday to buyout specialists <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal worth about $ 109 a share to stockholders in cash and securities. When local shareholders receive their share of the proceeds, it could make for a very merry Christmas for area merchants. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Winstead </PERSON>, the general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Hanes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION>, said that unlike retailers in other parts of the country, merchants at his mall have seen strong sales so far in the Christmas shopping season. Money from the buyout could only make it better. `` The merchants of <LOCATION> Hanes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, as well as other retailers in this area, are prepared to serve with whatever the stockholders need,'' <PERSON> Winstead </PERSON> said. `` Do I sound reserved enough?'' <PERSON> Winstead </PERSON> said the people who have seen their stock climb by $ 37 a share over the past six weeks might well wish to make `` celebration-type purchases'' of luxury items when their checks arrive. At <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelers </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said she has already noticed an influx of customers who do n't look like the usual clientele for expensive jewelry. `` These are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be pricing our emeralds and diamonds,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. She said she assumes the prospective customers are scouting out purchases they could make with the proceeds from the sale of their <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock. The company moved its headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last year but maintains the core of its tobacco operations here. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, sales manager at a Mercedes dealership, said he has n't yet seen any customers who are eager to put down their RJR profits on a new Mercedes. But he added: `` I hope we do see some increase in traffic due to that.'' Two local realtors _ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> _ said some <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> investors may put their proceeds into new homes. `` What I see happening is what anyone would see if you have a rich uncle die,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. `` I think a lot of people will take awhile, but they'll eventually look at upgrading their living standards.'' But economists at two local universities said the windfall probably wo n't spawn a huge spending spree in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said many investors _ and especially large institutions _ will probably just reinvest their money. `` Most people are n't going to confuse it with income,'' he said. `` They would say, ` These are assets that I worked to create, so I'm not going to go out and blow it on a vacation.' He said employees of subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who are worried about the future of their jobs will probably be careful about how they use the money from the sale of their company. `` Not all of that spending will take place immediately, and not all of it will take place in <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jud </PERSON>, a professor of finance at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Analysts Expect Asset Auction, Less New Product Spending</HEAD>

 Some of the world's best-known food brands may ultimately be sold and spending on marketing and new product development may be cut as a result of the $ 24.5 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said Thursday. But the analysts said they can not predict whether retail prices will go up or consumers will find it harder to locate their favorite snacks until it becomes clear who winds up with specific products. Many analysts expect the apparent winner in the buyout battle, a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will be forced to sell chunks of the company to meet interest payments on the huge debt that will be incur in making the purchase. `` I've got to assume they will sell a lot of the foods operations,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, the food and tobacco analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Interstate-Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> probably would keep the tobacco company because of the strong cash flow it generated and then sell stock to the public later to raise money. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> could not be reached for comment on their plans for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman speaking on condition that she not be identified said the firm had said repeatedly it wanted `` to keep the company as intact as possible'' and avoid `` massive selling of all the food operations.'' But <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> and other analysts said the debt costs would make it all but certain that the new owners would be forced to sell some key operations, such as <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s cookie and cracker business, its candy, cereal and snack foods interests or its Del Monte canned vegetable and tropical fruits divisions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, the food and tobacco analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the new owners could get $ 8 billion for either the Nabisco foods business or the <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> tobacco business, $ 4 billion to $ 7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> and $ 800 million to $ 1.2 billion for the Planters nuts and Life Savers candy business. The list of buyers who analysts cite as potential buyers of parts of the Nabisco operations include the biggest names in consumer products _ <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ralston-Purina </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Borden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, food and tobacco analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, might be keenly interested in <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s ready-to-eat cookie business. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s cookie brands include Oreo, Chips Ahoy and <PERSON> Fig </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and it also owns Ritz crackers. He said <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> or Quaker might be interested in adding <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s Shredded Wheat to their line of cereals, while <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> might want Planters nuts to expand their own snack food operations Whether or not major assets are sold, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said, the new owners will have to cut corners to meet debt payments. `` You could see some modest reductions in advertising and other marketing tools such as couponing and consumer promotions,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was for fifth largest national advertiser in 1987, spending nearly $ 840 million in support of both its food and tobacco businesses last year, according to the trade journal Advertising Age. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> expects a sharp decline in new product introductions because `` you just do n't have the latitude for loss that you had as an ongoing company.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s New Product News, said less than 1 percent of the 11,000 new food and drug products this year will produce the level of national sales that major companies generally consider a success. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stibel </PERSON>, a partner in the marketing firm <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said the prospects for any given line of food products rests entirely with the group that ultimately ends up owning them. Companies that buy a product line to expand their existing share of markets generally spend heavily to promote them and may raise prices, he said. But companies that buy a product line in hopes of selling it later for a profit may be more apt to cut promotional spending and try to live off the line's reputation as long as possible, he said. The fallout from the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> buyout would no necessarily be limited to the food operations, <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the buyout could mean an early end to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s two-month test of its smokeless cigarette, Premier, which delivers nicotine like a cigarette without much of the smoke `` The Premier appeared to be a dead product to begin with. Consumer aceptanmce of the product has been dismal. Health authorities have been rallying against it,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. He said the new owners might decide to spare themselves the legal costs that might be needed to defend the product against legal challenges. `` Premier will become the Edsel of 1988,'' he predicted, referring to the automobile that proved a costly failure.

 The stock market drifted mostly lower today in subdued trading as investors awaited new evidence on the strength of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, was down 5.34 at 2,109.17 with one hour left in the session. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 4 to 3 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 613 up, 785 down and 521 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 103.29 million shares at 3 p.m. on Wall Street compared with 130.18 million shares at the same point in Wednesday's session.

That presumably would mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher interest rates to restrain growth and inflation. But investors were looking toward Friday's report on November employment for confirmation of economic growth trends. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said today's decline in prices reflected `` some precautionary selling on the part of traders who do n't want to be caught long if the employment figures are negative.

 As this week's deadline for final bids approached, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told a reporter for Time magazine: `` If I fail, I'm on the hook.'' That worst-case scenario nows faces the once-confident chief executive, whose management team launched a bidding war six weeks ago in hopes of taking the nation's 19th largest industrial company private. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group apparently lost out to buyout specialists <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday after running up the price tag for the food and tobacco company to more than $ 24 billion. For <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, it was a stunning defeat that contrasts sharply to his quick rise to the top of the food and tobacco conglomerate. Also at stake were immense financial rewards _ under his initial bid, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> stood to make $ 100 million. What's worse, a corporate takeover by outsiders can mean unemployment for a target company's top management, and a <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> makes it unlikely <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will stay there for long. But the turmoil that generally accompanies takeovers has n't stopped the 56-year-old <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> before on his path from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s prairies to the riches and celebrity that accompany leadership in the upper echelons of corporate As the youngest chairman and chief executive officer ever to head <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> made the packaged-goods company an enticing target for a 1981 takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He got the top post at the newly-created company three years later, when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaerberle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s chief executive officer, took early retirement. Under <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s leadership, an increasingly profitable <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> caught the eye of <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the food company for $ 4.9 billion in 1985. Again, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did not immediately get the top management job. But <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s board presented it to him the following year. His willingness to take risks with his own job has contributed to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s reputation as an aggressive executive with an uncanny intuition and lightning responses. `` He operates from the gut and makes some large decisions from the gut,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, whose FCB-Leber <ORGANIZATION> Katz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> handles some <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> advertising. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had been <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive just 15 days when he announced the company was moving its headquarters from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home for over a century to its central tobacco division, to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. On Day 16, he announced the sale of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> liquor and wine business for $ 1.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Dry and more than two dozen other operations also went on the block later as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> focused the company on packaged food and tobacco. Early plans to sell the tobacco division were canceled as it became clear that cigarettes remained a profitable business. And <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s previously announced plans to reorganize the company internally to boost its stock price were canceled in mid-October when <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered nearly $ 12 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s leveraged buyout proposal for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> came soon after, amid a wave of takeovers aimed at food companies such as `` When an opportunity hits, you got to hit,'' he once told the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution, punctuating his remark with a boxer's jab `` Once he decides to make a move, he makes it,'' said longtime associate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbonell </PERSON>. `` He likes to speak in terms of quantum leaps in achieving competitive advantages.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, and earned a degree in commerce at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manitoba </ORGANIZATION> while serving as president of his fraternity and a member of the basketball team. He paid his own way to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> after graduation to accept a job with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices drifted lower today in a lackluster performance restrained by anticipation of Friday's release of November employment statistics. The market had rallied earlier this week on indications that the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace. That presumably would mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher interest rates to restrain growth and inflation. But analysts said trading slowed today as investors looked toward Friday's report on November employment for confirmation of economic growth trends. If the report shows stronger-than-expected job growth, some market watchers expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may feel obliged to encourage higher interest rates. Rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields on fixed-income investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills relatively more attractive compared with the risks inherent in owning stocks.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will post the first annual loss in its 103-year history as a result of a $ 6.7 billion pre-tax charge that covers the costs of scrapping outdated equipment and moving, retiring or laying off 16,000 employees. Wall Street saw the giant charge as a sign that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> was moving aggressively to cut costs and install a new digital network to meet the competition. The stock was fairly stable, falling 50 cents to $ 29.37 -LCB- a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The charge will not affect <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's cash flow, its ability to pay dividends or the money available for investment. `` This reflects the adjustment of going from a regulated marketplace to a competitive marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a San Francisco-based analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said the charge would reduce its after-tax profits by $ 3.9 billion That makes it likely that the company will lose about $ 1.6 billion in all of 1988 and $ 3.3 billion in the fourth quarter alone. The only larger quarterly losses in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history were <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's own $ 4.87 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1983, which involved a charge to prepare for the Bell System breakup, and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.76 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 stemming from its legal fight with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> Long-distance phone companies have been moving aggressively to replace their old-fashioned analog equipment with new digital equipment that provides higher quality and is better suited to custom services and transmission of computer data. The bulk of the charge, $ 5.0 billion, is to reflect on the books the lower value of outdated analog network equipment. The remaining $ 1.7 billion is for the costs of removing the outdated equipment, writedowns in the value of related equipment, and reductions in employment. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it would reduce the number of its network employees by 10,000 and the number of its operators by 6,000 over the next few years. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T does not yet know how many of the employees will be given jobs elsewhere in the company because that depends on the company's growth, spokeswoman <PERSON> LuAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said The Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the union representing 135,000 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T workers, issued a statement saying non-management employees have suffered the loss of 78,500 jobs since 1984 while management ranks have risen by 13,600. `` This company just has not bitten the bullet _ it has not come out of its ` monopoly cocoon' levels of management,'' the union said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> responded that the company had to hire white-collar workers because of its new thrusts into computers and foreign markets. But he said `` we're not blind to the fact'' that staff jobs need to be cut. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has a freeze on hiring over most of the company. That gives the displaced employees a better chance to find work elsewhere within the company than if they had to face competition from new hires. Plans to reduce 3,000 of the network jobs and all 6,000 of the operator service jobs had already been announced to employees, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said. The company is setting aside $ 400 million to cover the cost of redeploying them or giving them payments or incentives related to separation from the company by retirement or resignation. The job cuts are possible because improvements in the network reduce the need for maintenance, engineering, service, order processing and call handling. Operators at new stations are able to handle 25 percent more calls per hour, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has switched over to a digital network far more rapidly than it had previously planned. The company predicted early in 1987 that it would take until the year 2010 to have an all-digital network. By the end of 1987 it said it could do the job by 1991. On Thursday, it said it could do the job by the end of next year. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 and No. 3 competitors in long distance, have also moved rapidly to put in digital networks and have taken big charges to write down the book value of their outdated analog equipment. Executives of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had said in October that writedowns in the fourth quarter could be substantial. By taking the pain of the writedown all at once, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T no longer has to lower its quarterly profits to reflect the costs of depreciating the older equipment. `` We view this as very positive news,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. `` Our network will continue to be the best out there.'' AT & amp; T took a $ 10 billion pre-tax charge at the end of 1983 to prepare for the divestiture of its local telephone companies. It also took pre-tax charges of $ 200 million in 1985 and $ 3.2 billion at the end of 1986. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has reduced employment by 64,000 since the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1, 1984. It has about 310,000 employees now, and that could drop to below 300,000 over the next three to five years, Ms. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. As large as the job cuts are, securities analysts said they could be even larger. `` They have grossly too many people. At the time of divestiture, a lot of people were unloaded onto them,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the cuts have occurred gradually because `` they're a very humane employer.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had originally indicated it had a surplus of 12,000 to 14,000 operators, and that the union bargained the company down to 6,000. <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said the thrust of the statement was correct but <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could not confirm the union's numbers.

 When the managers of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> aligned themselves with a competing investment house and put the company in play, it did n't take long to flush out <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, the master of Wall Street's buyout game. Six weeks after jumping into the fray to protect his `` franchise'' on leveraged buyouts, King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> is still on top. At 44, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is the highest profile member of the partnership of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is credited with making the leveraged buyout technique a powerful factor in the biggest takeover binge in American history. The partnership's apparent victory in the unprecedented auction for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> _ with a bid exceeding $ 24.5 billion _ joins other crown jewels in <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kravis </LOCATION>'s expanding showcase of corporate acquisitions. Before the food and tobacco gem came <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, for 6.1 billion in 1986; <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 4.2 billion the same year; <ORGANIZATION> Storer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion in 1985; and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 1.2 billion in 1988, among others. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is the undisputed leader in LBOs, in which it and other investors put up a small amount of money and borrows the rest, repaying the debt with the acquired company's earnings, the sale of assets or both. In the past 10 years, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> has spent more than $ 38 billion acquiring about 35 companies. Investors in the firm's growing LBO investment fund have earned about 40 percent returns in the process, and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has become manager of a huge conglomerate. The man at the top of the heap of all that debt _ and power _ is <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> boy who has found a home on Wall Street and the social circles of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Married to a glamorous fashion designer, <PERSON> Carolyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> lives a life straight out of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s novel `` The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' While he works incessantly, he finds time to dash out to key dates on the party circuit and entertain guests at his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> estate, where _ rumor has it _ the smell of fresh-baked croissants is piped into the guestrooms every morning. `` It's a high-voltage existence,'' his wife said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> magazine earlier this year. At work, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> was the protege of <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>, who left the fold last year after a falling out with <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the other major partner. The principal point of disagreement between <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> and his partners was the size of deals the firm should pursue. <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> stand ready to scale ever more challenging heights. Although the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> buyout carries more than $ 20 billion in debt, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> believes the deal is still conservative. The amount of equity in the acquired company is estimated at about $ 7.4 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In terms of leveraged buyouts, that is considered low, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> said Thursday. The deal was an even more critical measure of <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>'s personal and professional prestige _ which is why he entered the bidding in such a brazen way in the first place. After <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> first announced his plan to take the company private Oct. 20, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> rushed to make his own proposal. Initially, he tried to call off <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s financial advisers, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a meeting in which <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> offered to top <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s bid to `` protect his franchise. <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>'s overtures were greeted with a flat rejection from the management group and the bidding war was on. If <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> succeeds in adding <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco and food holdings to his stable, the LBO kingdom will boast revenues of $ 50 billion or more _ about the same as blue-chip <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's a sense of one-upmanship in the financial markets,'' said one stock analyst early on in the battle for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. `` These people want to say, ` We've done the biggest deal ... We're the best.' For the moment, <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> is just that.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Slide on Absence of Soviet Wheat Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting disappointment that the new grain deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had not yet produced a wheat transaction, analysts said. Other grain futures closed mostly lower and soybeans posted substantial losses on fears of a wet weekend in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean belt. On other markets, sugar futures rose sharply; precious metals declined; energy futures rallied; livestock and meat futures were higher; and stock-index futures advanced. Many wheat traders had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to offer the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a large amount of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the Export Enhancement Program within days of Monday's signing of a 27-month grain agreement. The absence of such an offer spawned speculation Thursday that the superpowers were still haggling over price and that any purchases would not be immediately forthcoming, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The trade is beginning to believe that we may not see the wheat business coming in December, and maybe not until well after that,'' he said. The new grain agreement calls for the Soviets to purchase 4 million metric tons of wheat, 4 million tons of corn and 1 million tons of their choice in both the current year, which began Oct. 1, and the following year. Conflicting forecasts for the weekend weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where soybean planting is under way, prompted a sell-off in the soybean pit, analysts said. If the dry weather that has marked the early part of the planting period persists into the growing season, South American forecasts could lend a fair amount of volatility to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures market, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Wheat settled 3 cents to 10 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.16 a bushel; corn was 4 cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.57 \ a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with December at $ 1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 5 -LCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with January at $ 7.58 a Sugar futures made strong gains on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a rally linked to bullish technical signals and indications that world production may fall short of consumption this year, leading to a reduction in stockpiles. At this point, though, `` there appears to be plenty of physical sugar available, so it seems to be just a speculative rally,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON>, sugar market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar settled .31 cent to .49 cent higher with the active March contract at 11.44 cents a pound, the highest price for March delivery since July 25.

A strengthening of the dollar also contributed to lower precious-metals prices, as did jitters prior to Friday's release of November unemployment figures. `` That always makes traders uneasy,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

Expectations for a mid-December slowdown in hog slaughters boosted pork futures, he said.

 Share prices dropped Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in an edgy session, as players grew nervous about forecasts of difficult conditions in the British retailing industry. The FT-SE 100-share index finished down 13.7 points, or 0.76 percent, at 1,778.7, above its late-afternoon low of 1,771.7. Volume was a sparse 343.4 million shares, down sharply from 444.8 million traded Wednesday. British fashion retailer Next said recent rises in domestic interest rates and other economic factors would produce a `` significant'' drop in the company's profit for fiscal 1988.

 Stock prices drifted lower Thursday in a sluggish session marked by worries that interest rates may be headed higher. Analysts said many investors appeared to prefer standing aside in advance of the November employment report due Friday which could provide some indication of whether the economy is moderating or overheating. `` Right now everybody is sitting back waiting for the employment figures,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an analyst for the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` Nobody has any conviction one way or the other.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, lost 12.63 to close at 2,101.88. Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8-to-7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 680 issues up, 805 down and 486 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 129.38 million shares, down from 157.81 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 155.12 million shares. Analysts said traders were worried that employment growth in November would indicate faster-than-expected expansion in the economy. If the economy were found to be expanding too quickly, many analysts fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may feel compelled to push interest rates higher to slow it down and restrain inflation. Higher rates make short-term fixed-income investments more competitive with the uncertain returns on stocks. Three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, for instance, are yielding about 8.10 percent. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said most economists expect payroll growth of between 225,000 and 250,000 in November. A number significantly higher than that, he said, `` would mean the economy is in fact overheating and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to step on the monetary brakes more heavily than they have already.'' But there is considerable uncertainty about how fast the economy is expanding. Stocks rallied earlier this week on indications that the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace. In a new report Thursday, the government said its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in October after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in September. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 \ to 91 -RCB- and was the most active stock on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> The company said late Wednesday it had accepted an offer of $ 109 a share in cash and securities from buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, spurning a competing offer from a management group. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was also active. It fell -LCB- to 29 -RRB- after saying it will take a $ 6.7 billion charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses related to getting rid of outdated telephone equipment. General Cinema climbed 2 to 23 ~ after announcing its planned to sell its soft drink bottling business to <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 to 38 ~ Stocks of some of the major retailing companies slipped after they reported November sales that analysts called sluggish. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> lost -RRB- to 39 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 52 ~ but K mart rose -LRB- to 35 -RCB- As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market fell $ 5.91 billion, or 0.22 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.53 to 153.37. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index lost 1.34 to 313.78, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.21 to 272.49 At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index rose 0.89 to 295.25.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> stunned CBS with a record bid of $ 401 million Thursday to win the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which televised the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, had been considered a longshot to get the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> rights. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was favored because it already owns the TV rights to the 1992 Winter Games in <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> fee topped the previous Olympic record of $ 309 million paid by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for the Winter Olympics in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 300 million for the TV rights in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` We did n't go into this to lose money,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Our plan was designed to minimize losses. It's not designed to make a lot of money.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also said that as part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend $ 10 million to promote the city of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>, executive producer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>, said he was a `` little bit surprised'' that the network got the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> rights. `` The first call after I found out was to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewert </PERSON>, our coordinating producer -LRB- in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` I sure hope you saved all your notes because I threw mine out.''' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, who anchored <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s prime-time telecasts in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said: `` I think it's terrific news, especially for the guys who worked in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. I'm a little surprised, though. I naturally assumed that CBS had the inside track.'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>, said the record fee indicated his network might have gotten a bargain when it won the <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION> rights for $ 243 million. `` Certainly the magnitude of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> reaffirms the marketplace value of <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, president of oABC Sports, said, `` We are disappointed, but we congratulate <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on the acquisition.'' It was not immediately known how much CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bid, but a source said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was `` substantially higher.'' Olympic officials were seeking a minimum of $ 350 million. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> lost an estimated $ 75 million in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it made a `` modest'' profit in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, although it was much lower than expected due to disappointing ratings that forced the network to give sponsors free advertising. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to recoup some of its <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> fee by selling about 75 hours of Olympic programming to a cable network for between $ 50 million and $ 75 million. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>, said the network had `` a detailed cable plan,'' but would not elaborate. He also said events probably would not be shown on cable at the same time <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was broadcasting. Unlike <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, prime-time coverage from <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> will be taped because of the six-hour time difference with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But that drawback may be offset by the earlier starting date of the 1992 Games, which will not have to compete with football and the final weeks of baseball's pennant races. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics started Sept. 17, while the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> are to begin July 25. `` Every Olympics has its own feel and I think <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> will have a totally different look than <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said. `` I think we're in a very good position having done the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics We were very proud of what we did in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but I would be less than honest if I said I did n't expect to do this one better.''

<HEAD>Mexico Offers Export Reduction to Firm Up OPEC Accord</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> team plans to visit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other non-OPEC producing nations to discuss mutual reductions in export quotas, according to a published report Thursday. The report followed an offer by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate a reduction in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil exports in a bid to put some teeth into the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel agreement to restrict production. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> this week repeated an offer, previously spurned by the 13-member cartel, to reduce <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 1.35 million-barrel daily export platform, provided <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members enact similar reductions. Reductions also would be sought from other independent producers, <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> said. He said department officials planned informal talks with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and independent producers on possible quota reductions. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee plans to visit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other independent producers to negotiate reductions to buttress Monday's <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Department officials could not be reached for comment Thursday, a national holiday called to mark the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. The agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> calls for a cartel export ceiling of 18.5 million barrels daily, roughly 4 million barrels below current production. A statement issued this week by former President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> praised the agreement and urged immediate consultations between cartel and independent producers. But he warned much remained to be done to shore up the weak global market. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> urges all producers _ whether or not they are members of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> _ to act with caution in the next few months,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, has closely followed the cartel's pricing and production guidelines. Only two weeks ago, <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was abandoning that policy, because overproduction by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members had rendered its market quotas useless. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> severely criticized <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> this year for engaging in a price war it said threatened <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and dragged down average prices of Mexican export crude to under $ 10. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> loses an estimated $ 500 million in foreign earnings for each $ 1 drop in crude prices. Energy Department officials acknowledge the country has lost $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue this year.

<TEXT>
 In an effort to capitalize on a string of box office successes, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced formation of a third movie production arm called <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. Disney, presently the nation's top producer of movies through its <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> divisions, said the new company would start up Feb. 1. Within three years, it is to be making 12 movies a year, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> will make movies similar to those from <LOCATION> Touchstone </LOCATION>, which produces mainline fare considerably racier than <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional animated features and kids' comedies. Budgets will be similar to those at <LOCATION> Touchstone </LOCATION>, which is known in the business for holding the line on production costs and stars' salaries All Disney films are distributed through a unit called <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION>, which, according to a ranking by the Hollywood trade paper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>, has the biggest share of the nation's box office this year. Up to Nov. 13, <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> movies grabbed 20.5 percent of domestic movie ticket sales, according to Variety. Disney is followed on that list by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> at 14.1 percent, 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> at 12.3 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> at 10.7 percent and <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> at 9.8 percent. Touchstone, formed in 1984, surprised many moviegoers by departing from the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> tradition of family-oriented entertainment, producing some films that earned R ratings. <PERSON> Touchstone </PERSON> reaped a box office bonanza last year with `` Good Morning: <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' and `` Three Men and a Baby.'' <PERSON> Touchstone </PERSON> has had three recent non-starters: `` Heartbreak Hotel,'' `` The Good Mother'' and `` Ernest Saves Christmas.''

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,058.0 billion in the week ended Nov. 21, from $ 3,044.7 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,895.1 billion from $ 3,881.8 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $ 785.1 billion from $ 779.6 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 614 million in the week ended Nov. 23 to $ 55.546 billion, compared with a gain of $ 160 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window averaged $ 1.104 billion a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 294 million in the previous week That was the highest level since the week ended Sept. 21 when borrowings averaged $ 1.24 billion a day. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 286.1 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 285.1 billion two weeks earlier

Among the measure's other provisions is a requirement that, beginning in November 1989, the state insurance commissioner approve all rate increases. Any increases that are `` excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory'' will be prohibited.

 A <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> soft drink bottler was fined $ 1 million Thursday after pleading guilty to price-fixing in a dozen east <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties in 1983. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Habig </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, entered the guilty plea in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> on behalf of the company's board of directors The $ 1 million fine, the maximum, was part of the plea agreement between the company and prosecutors. The company also agreed to cooperate with a continuing investigation of price-fixing in the soft drink industry, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, who represented the government. Because the investigation is still underway, <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said, he could not comment further on the circumstances of the price-fixing. <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>, the giant soft-drink company, bought <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION> in June, said corporate spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All these incidents occurred when the company was owned by another company,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said, although he said he could not disclose the identity of the former owners. `` All the individuals involved in the price-fixing have since left the company, had in fact already left when we assumed ownership.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> was aware of the price-fixing investigation when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, bottles <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and Seven-Up products. It employs 1,200 people in five states. The charge against <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> alleges that the company and others `` engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing discount prices of soft drink products sold in six-pack, 12-ounce cans'' in the following <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties: <LOCATION> Loudon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sevier </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Blount </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grainger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cocke </PERSON>.

The takeover would dwarf the previous record $ 13.4 billion paid for <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. It also would come less than four years after tobacco maker <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> for nearly $ 5 billion. _ Oct 24: Investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the leader in leveraged buyouts, offers $ 20.25 billion or $ 90 a share in cash and securities for RJR. _ Oct 27: <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> joins <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as the main backers of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> takes its bid directly to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with a tender offer for their stock. _ Nov 2: Informal talks between the two competing bidders to undertake a joint takeover collapse, partly because of disputes on fees to be paid to the investment bankers. _ Nov 4: <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group raises its bid to $ 92 a share or $ 20.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a buyout specialist that competes with <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, suggests it is interested in possibly bidding for the company as well. _ Nov 7: <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s committee of outside directors announces it will entertain bids for the company while pursuing other options, including a debt-financed restructuring. _ Nov 16: <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance subsidiaries, large holders of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> corporate bonds, sue <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, claiming the leveraged buyout contemplated by management hurt the value of those bonds. _ Nov 17: <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> says it wo n't bid for RJR. <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another big <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bondholder, files the second major lawsuit against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and RJR. _ Nov 18: The first deadline for submitting bids to the special <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> committee passes, and proposals are received from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> and a late contender, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ 20: RJR special committee extends the auction until Nov. 29, saying the offers received were inadequate. It said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> offered $ 100 a share or $ 22.7 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 94 a share or $ 21.3 billion; and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> offerd a vague plan it valued as high as $ 118 a share or $ 26.8 billion. _ Nov 28 _ In an interview published in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, his first public statement since the the takeover fight began, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> denies he undertook the leveraged buyout for personal enrichment, although he could make $ 100 million. _ Nov 29 _ The second deadline for bids expires and all three bidders submit new offers worth at least $ 100 a share each.
