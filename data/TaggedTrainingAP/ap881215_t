 Snow and sleet blanketed much of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Thursday and dozens of cars crashed on an icy mountain interstate, killing two people. The snow also blocked thousands of motorists on a coastal highway. Snow flurries appeared in the southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and sleet and rain fell around <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, including hills that were dry and ablaze only a week ago, as the storm swept from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s midsection. As temperatures headed down to the 40s for the night, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gave hotel vouchers to homeless people and opened shelters in a recreation center and an armory. Two armories opened as shelters in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Ten crashes involving dozens of vehicles and two deaths occurred on Interstate 15 in <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>. No information was immediately available on the deaths. At midmorning police began slowly escorting groups of cars through the pass behind snowplows rather than require use of chains, which causes miles of backup and hours of delay. `` It's just like a winter wonderland up there,'' said Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roden </PERSON>. Thousands of motorists were stuck when snow closed Highway 101 north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, which is about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, police said. `` One of the problems is here we do n't have the snow equipment to take care of this _ it does n't happen here,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stricker </PERSON>. Cuesta Summit is only 1,500 feet above sea level, and <PERSON> Stricker </PERSON> noted, snow fell not only at the top but at the bottom of the grade as well. A college basketball game between <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> Poly-San <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Obispo </PERSON> was canceled because the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> team was stranded at <LOCATION> Atascadero </LOCATION> on the north side of the grade, said <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poly </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. Motel rooms filled up fast in <LOCATION> Atascadero </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paso </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> as the highway traffic ground to a halt, said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who works at the Paso Robles Inn. It was the first snowfall Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had seen there in 22 years. Interstate 5 over the <LOCATION> Tejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was snowy and slick but the major north-south route through the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriels </LOCATION> remained open. The storm was generated by a cold, upper-level low over <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> that moved through central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The low was expected to drift west on Friday. <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> warmed only to 56 degrees Thursday, compared to a normal of 68. Rainfall totaled .77 inch by 6 p.m., bringing the season total to 1.56 inches compared to a normal 3.29 inches by Dec. 15. Elsewhere, rainfall totaled 1.69 inches at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION>, 1.68 inches at <LOCATION> Newhall </LOCATION>, .95 inch at <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, and 1.14 inch at Point Mugu by evening. Just a week earlier the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> was swept by warm and fierce <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds. Dozens of homes were burned by wind-blown fires in two suburbs on Dec. 8, and the next day more burned in a 3,000-acre brush fire in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Susana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> above the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Snow flurries were reported on the floor of the southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> and <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, the weather service said. Snowfall ranged from 2 to 6 inches in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and some schools were closed, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON>. `` Of course, people in this area are n't prepared for snow,'' he said.

 A woman charged Thursday that heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> sexually molested her in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> disco last week, the second woman to make such a charge. The woman, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> said she planned to sue <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> for mental anguish and trauma. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said she was dancing with a male partner at <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>'s Disco Lounge around 2 a.m. Sunday when `` Someone grabbed my behind under my dress. `` I turned around and screamed, ` try that again and I'll slap the -- -- out of you,''' she said. `` Then it dawned on me that I was screaming at the heavyweight champion of the world,'' she said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to announce his upcoming fight with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, said, `` I do n't even know this person, I do n't know what happened.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was standing on the dance floor with two male companions when the incident occurred. `` He put his hands up in the air and said `` Whoa, whoa, we have a live one here,''' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and his friends then moved away to another area of the disco. Asked if her male partner confronted <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> on the dance floor, she replied: `` No, the man had common sense.'' She said she was willing to put aside the incident but when she read two days ago that another woman had charged <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> with sexually molesting her at <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>'s on the same night she decided to come forward. Her attorney, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, said the lawsuit will seek $ 1 million in damages for `` trauma, shock and mental anguish.'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is scheduled to be interviewed by detectives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to determine if any criminal complaints should be filed. `` I am really angry and embarrassed at the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday defended opening a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it `` just another step'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process and saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should n't worry about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commitment to its security. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he would not hesitate to `` break off communications'' if <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> reneged on its acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s sovereignty or its renunciation of terrorism as an instrument to achieve policy objectives. During separate Oval Office picture-taking sessions with Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, the president said he decided to reverse his longstanding opposition to contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of statements that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday. When asked if he thought that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was justified in being upset with his administration's move, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` Well, I do n't think so, in the sense that we have made it very plain that we have not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the safety of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Acting on the instructions of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, called the director general of the political section at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that `` at this point, there has been no substantive response in terms of time, place or location.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials later said that talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> probably would begin in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Friday afternoon. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the new opening a wary welcome, and they joined <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in seeking to reassure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will be alert to any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> tricks. `` This is good news and the right path to follow,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we would best be very careful that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any decepion.'' Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move and called it a `` significant step toward advancing the peace process.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the administration agreed to open a substantive dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after it became satisfied that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had complied with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for such direct contacts. Asked to explain the policy reversal, the president said: `` Well, because the words have been spoken, and the words were the words that we have been stating were necessary.'' But he said, `` Of course, ... the words must be matched by performance, and if they're not, why, we're back where we started. Questioned about what he would do if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> failed to live up to its commitments, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Well, we'd certainly break off communications.'' He stressed that the ultimate solution in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` does not depend on outsiders _ or us.'' `` Peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting with each other and settling their differences,'' he said. Asked why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` ... Because there is no such thing as of now. There is n't a Palestinian state. And if you recognize someone ... as that, it would be us declaring who was in charge there.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said commencing exploratory talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was `` just another step in what we've been trying for eight years _ to bring about peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision `` I have n't spelled out any hopes about it,'' he added. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met the conditions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we will go forward with a dialogue, not negotiations, but a dialogue. ... Let's see how things evolve.'' As for the discussions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There's no game plan; there's no five-point program.'' Asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his administration starts next month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I am vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I become president on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement late Wednesday left <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in diplomatic isolation and came just a few hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken a tough line against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, declaring it failed to meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in statements made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> about the same time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking, had met the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a `` substantive dialogue'' _ a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the Palestinian group. Only a day earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> failed to meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions. And less than three weeks ago, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of terrorism, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` an accessory to such terrorism'' and denied the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader an entry visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> long has insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, adopted in 1967 and 1973, affirming the right of all states in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to live in peace. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not specifically mentioned. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has demanded that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization renounce terrorism and accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. White House spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would move `` cautiously into the dialogue'' with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives and that the talks would `` establish a foundation'' for the organization `` to prove that they have changed their ways.'' `` It's too early to speculate on how these things might take place,'' he said. `` This is a first step ... and how the follow-on steps will evolve, we really do n't want to draw parameters at this point.'' `` We did have strong feelings about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and we still have strong feelings,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he said the administration decided to permit contacts because there has been `` evidence of change.''

 There's a moment in <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s movie, `` Bird,'' when the great jazzman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> stands on a blackened <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stage after finishing a concert, consuming massive doses of applause and sniffing a long-stemmed red rose. He was something of a god to jazz zealots, but perhaps the tortured musical genius never really got a chance to wake up and smell the roses. He mutilated his life with drugs and alcohol, and died at the age of 34 in 1955. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, who has loved jazz since his childhood and who always wanted to film a portrait of <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, attempts to harness the Bird's creative spirit and all the creative juices of that time _ a time when bebop came to the fore and brought jazz into the modern age At the same time, it pokes into the underbelly of the jazz world with its stark portrayal of drugs, alcohol, debauchery. `` His life was obviously filled with many excesses _ sort of a dichotomy,'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> says. `` How a person who can be so brilliant and who spent hours and hours to become as great as he did and have that kind of discipline could not in any other part of his life. That was always a wonder to me. `` But I wanted a movie where you root for him. ... I just wanted to explore the fact that he was brilliant and innovative, and the other just became a part of his life.'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> even films `` Bird'' in a dark, brownish hue. `` Most of the jazz world is nocturnal,'' he says. `` TV unfortunately has shown a whole generation that flat light is the only way. I do n't like flat light. I like the feel of the movie; I like to look into a film instead of having it look out at you. I approached the color of it in terms of black and white.'' Forest <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> -LRB- `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' `` Platoon'' -RRB- is gentle yet fierce, playful yet obsessed in his role as <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, for which he was awarded the best actor prize at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. It was well deserved for a stunning performance that even captures the hunched body stances once assumed by the musician as he performed. As <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venora </PERSON> -LRB- `` Ironweed,'' `` F-X'' -RRB- finds the right balance between free spirit and strong, loving wife who battles her husband's philandering and personal demons and at the same time champions his work and well-being. `` Bird'' followed the success of last year's `` Round Midnight,'' the story of an expatriate sax player in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Tenor saxophone great <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who once worked with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, received an Academy Award nomination for his role as the tragic <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Though based loosely on the late jazz musician <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavernier </PERSON>'s movie is a universal story of jazz artists who fled bigotry and rough times in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for the allure of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> during the 1940s,'50s and'60s. `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Blues,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritt </PERSON>'s 1961 jazz movie starring <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, takes a more romantic, <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> approach. The late <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> received an Oscar nomination for his score. In `` Bird,'' <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON> did the score, which isolates <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s original playing of `` <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>,'' `` April in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' `` Ornithology,'' `` <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s Mood'' and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded solos with contemporary musicians including bassist <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, trumpeter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Faddis </PERSON>, pianists <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> Jazz purists have been rankled by the soundtrack, which they say is technically excellent but misses the interplay between <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and his sidemen. But <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> defends his decision: `` If you're going to do a film and have stereophonic sound, you need to record well. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> never had the opportunity to do stereophonic sound.'' <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and took up first baritone and then alto sax while still in high school, which he left at the age of 14 so he could study such greats as <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Count </PERSON> <PERSON> Basie </PERSON> in the local clubs. He soon found himself in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where a young trumpet player named <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> was all the rage. With Thelonious Monk and <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> on piano, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> on drums and later a young <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on trumpet, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz _ bebop. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, whose nickname was Yardbird and shortened to <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, stumbled into the lost world of night life. But even with the debiliation of drugs and alcohol, he never failed to solve musical problems and invent new directions. `` There have been no great harmonic changes in jazz since <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and Dizzy,'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> says. And then he muses, what musical levels would <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> have reached today had he lived? `` It would be interesting,'' the actor-filmmaker says.

<TEXT>
 The rage of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> these days is easy to spot. Just look for the tiny antennas, the telltale sign of the portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go. Despite price tags of $ 2,000 or more, the hand-held telephones have become a huge hit in this British colony, where doing business is a 24-hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in demand. Downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed, antenna-up, into briefcases. Away from the financial district, people can be seen barking into the phones while eating in restaurants, riding public buses and ferries, or sitting in darkened movie theaters. Everyone from executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting away. The <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent 100-kilometer -LRB- 62-mile -RRB- charity walk along a rural trail. `` In driving rain and a lashing wind, a young man was spotted eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone,'' it said. `` In a more normal society one would expect -LRB- him -RRB- to hand the phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race. -LRB- But -RRB- a few kilometers down the track, the young man was spotted merrily informing the financial markets at large of his continued existence.'' The government estimates about 60,000 portable cellular telephones _ roughly six times earlier projections _ will be in use by the end of the year in this territory of 5.7 million people, said Deputy Postmaster General <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, whose department is in charge of telecommunications. While most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for use in cars, roughly three-fourths of the units sold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive handheld models. `` We were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great way,'' Wise said. <ORGANIZATION> Hutchison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, which has sold about 26,000 cellular telephones, recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was outpacing the company's capacity to handle all the calls. `` The market just caught everybody by surprise,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a rival firm `` We're all frantically rebuilding networks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON>, a psychology lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to `` the importance of face. It's a status symbol.'' Wise believes the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> work ethic of doing business whenever and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous sales. `` Virtually the whole day is part of the working day,'' he said. Although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the telephones, their indiscriminate use in public places already is viewed as an irritation by some. `` People are becoming aware of the annoyance factor,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests check their telephones at the door.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pub conversations in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, where people are fond of their drink and free with their opinions, are likely to be spiced with some regret these days. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s whiskey industry, the world's original, is now owned by the French. Losing its treasures to outsiders _ principally the conquering <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> and English _ is no new experience for this small island nation. Today, with liquor industries around the world tending to consolidate, and with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, losing a major industry to an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> partner is perhaps inevitable. But it hurts all the same. <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which makes all the world's Irish whiskey and calls itself `` the spirit of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' was won on Nov. 24 by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> liquor company <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> after a six-month battle with a hostile bidder, the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, liquor company of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The news is by no means all bad: analysts say a fair price is being paid for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' shares; its 1,100 employees' jobs are assured; and the future looks brighter for its brands, which include <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> and Bushmills. But over a neat measure of Irish whiskey or a pint of dark, frothy <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> O'Donoghue </ORGANIZATION>'s _ arguably <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s most famous pub _ it's the losses, not the gains, that come to mind. `` I would obviously be disappointed when a company based in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> becomes owned by someone other than <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON>, echoing the sentiments of several customers, shouted over lively Irish music. Ms. <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON>, a mental health worker, is reticent about her age, but not about her preferred whiskey: Bushmills. `` Irish whiskey is one of the most traditional products that this country exports,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fell </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vintners </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were anxious to maintain the integrity of Irish spirits. The main problem we were concerned with was that the company would be broken up.'' The issue was important enough for the government to step in and ensure that <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> did not alter the Irish whiskey industry, which is a monopoly, or sell off brands without official approval. <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> sought out <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ricard </LOCATION> as a friendly bidder to fend off Grand Met, which offered $ 499 million. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON>'s offer was lower, at $ 442 million, but it promised to safeguard jobs and develop brands, while Grand Met said it intended to dispose of at least one brand Grand Met threw in the towel after several regulatory and court rulings in <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ricard </LOCATION>'s favor, but retains a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> limited by the government to 30 percent. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> has been a headline-making event, and very stressful for the company's workers. `` Certainly everybody had views about it. But the overwhelming feeling we got was of support,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' managing director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>. So, is Irish whiskey still Irish? `` I do n't think people will feel any different,'' <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said. `` With <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON>'s support, we'll be able to go on with the development of our brands. I think it's a good thing for the Irish industry.'' But <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, in an interview at the company's <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> headquarters, conceded: `` I do have a twinge of regret that <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> is not remaining an independent Irish company. There is a lot of heredity and tradition.'' The secret of perfume distillation reached <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in the 6th century and monks soon figured out how to use it for making whiskey. Irish Distillers' origins date to 1608 when Old Bushmills, which claims to be the world's oldest distillery, was licensed in northern <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antrim </LOCATION>. In 1966, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> and Son merged with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>. Bushmills joined the group in the 1970s, creating the monopoly. Irish Distillers suffered in the 1980s from the abstinence trend, and profits have been hurt by attempts to expand sales abroad. But sales now are growing here and overseas, <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said. In the six months ended March 31, the company produced a 40 percent year-to-year gain in net profit to $ 9.8 million, or 15 cents a share, on an 8 percent gain in revenue to $ 197 million. With 1.635 million standard cases in the year ended Sept. 30, 1987, Irish whiskey captured 36 percent of the spirits market in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and imported whiskeys accounted for 12 percent. Irish whiskey sales outside <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> came to nearly 1 million cases. The Scotch whisky industry shipped 75 million cases in 1987. Regrets aside, the overwhelming emotion at the company is relief that the suspense is over and that the friendly bidder prevailed. `` I just feel the best people won,'' said <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, 25, a receptionist at <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' largest bottling plant, in <LOCATION> Clondalkin </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Said Burrows: `` There will be continuity, but certainly there will be certain changes.'' In the meantime, nothing is going to interfere with Irishman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>'s plans. `` I'll still have my Paddy,'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said as he stepped off to his favorite pub. Yes, <PERSON> O'Donoghue </PERSON>'s. And yes, his eyes were smiling.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city was hit with a $ 60 million lawsuit Wednesday alleging negligence on the part of Fire Department paramedics who did not treat a 9-year-old boy who eventually died from an asthma attack. Fire department spokesmen claim the ambulance was pelted with eggs and rocks and paramedics were forced to retreat when they arrived at a housing project Monday. `` All the evidence we have says there was nothing being thrown at the paramedics,'' attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. `` They just flatly refused to go up'' to the apartment. <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> filed a lawsuit on behalf of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarnagin </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, died. The lawsuit asks for $ 10 million in actual damages and $ 50 million in punitive damages. A city attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, said he was aware of the lawsuit but had no comment. The paramedics, summoned by an emergency call at 4:16 p.m. Monday, were not aware of the seriousness of the asthma attack when they first arrived at the housing project, the Fire Department says. They left the scene and returned 24 minutes later when police arrived, according to the Fire Department. Police officers said they found the boy in a bedroom in the family's fifth-floor apartment. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Fire Department employees Tuesday washed the ambulance used by the paramedics, removing any trace of egg that may have been on it, <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. `` When we heard about it we got a protective order barring anyone from doing anything to the ambulance until we could inspect it,'' he said The order was issued Wednesday by Cook County Judge <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said tapes of communications between the paramedics and dispatchers show proof that the ambulance was hit by flying objects. `` At all times paramedics and emergency medical technicians should avoid placing themselves in danger,'' <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said, reading a city policy.

 Amateur astronomers using home computers and high-powered binoculars were able to track the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> as it deployed a secret spy satellite. `` If we could figure it out, you could bet that the Russians figured it out too,'' says <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON>, a self-described `` space enthusiast'' who helped organize the tracking. Although he said the information gathered had little practical use, the project showed secrecy is a rare commodity in the sky. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We do n't comment on secret satellite launches.'' <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON>, 35, said in a recent interview that the satellite watchers are hobbyists who work together informally, trading information through telephone calls, letters and electronic mail. The secrecy of the Atlantis' early December mission made their research challenging and intriguing `` detective work,'' <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> said. `` As space enthusiasts, for us to see the space shuttle is a very exciting thing,'' he said, adding that he was thrilled by the rare prospect the shuttle would be visible over Canadian skies. Shuttle orbits generally are farther south. <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> is an engineering technologist who specializes in energy conservation. His interest in space is visible in his sparsely furnished 23rd floor apartment; a computer and charts lie on his desk, books on the subject cram a bookcase and high-power binoculars sit on a stand near the door. The binoculars, said <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON>, are more useful than telescopes for satellite watching because they are easier to point and have a wider field of view. <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> had been in contact with about 150 other satellite watchers from as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> about the Atlantis' probable orbit. He circulated information including a `` test yourself'' page to make sure all participants could handle the necessary calculations. The <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> skies were cloudy on Dec. 2, the day of the Atlantis' launch, and <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> was unable to see it passing over Others did, and the calls started coming in while the craft was on its sixth orbit in the late afternoon. There were two sightings from the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> region and one from <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` To get three confirmations like that in the space of half an hour was very exciting,'' <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> said. `` We had more than a dozen people in this area looking for it.'' Knowing the times of the sightings allowed him to calculate the height of the orbit and, with the computer, he quickly was able to determine where the shuttle could be seen for the rest of the mission. <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> said the watchers sighted only the Atlantis on the sixth revolution, and the satellite was sighted by the seventh revolution three miles ahead of it. Continued sightings showed that for two days the shuttle stayed close to the satellite, which was observed to have a reddish color. He said it was very satisfying to determine that the satellite, known as Lacrosse, was deployed on the shuttle's first day in orbit. The news media was speculating that it would be released on the second day. `` The mission went the way we hypothesized it would,'' <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> said. The industry magazine <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> reported last week, citing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, that the $ 500 million radar-imaging satellite's deployment took place on the shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was launched at 9:30 a.m. EST Molzcan suspects the reddish color was from the thermal coverings of the satellite, because gold coverings in the past have been seen as reddish. `` It's sort of fun to speculate,'' he said. `` We'll probably never know, but it added to the whole fun of the exercise.'' His own glimpse did not come until the 37th revolution, about halfway through the four-day mission.

 The last five Italian warships have left the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the latest and largest cutback of foreign naval forces following the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, Italian officials say. The frigate Euro, flagship of the Italian flotilla, and the minehunters <PERSON> Castagno </PERSON> and Loto sailed through the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the gulf last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said Wednesday. They were bound for home. The frigate Sagittario and the supply tanker <PERSON> Stromboli </PERSON> left Nov. 24 and reached their home port at the <LOCATION> Taranto </LOCATION> naval base in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Monday, the ministry said. Italian officials announced the withdrawal in early November, saying the Aug. 20 cease-fire, which halted fighting in the 8-year-old war, had brought a `` consolidation of stability'' to the strategic waterway. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> deployed warships in the gulf after the Italian container ship <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> was attacked by Iranian gunboats while sailing to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, 1987. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> kept up to eight ships in the gulf at once.

The Italian departure reduced the number of foreign warships in or near the gulf to about 50, with half belonging to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At its peak late last year, the foreign naval force comprised more than 70 ships from seven countries.

 Two derailed railroad cars leaking highly explosive liquid propane Wednesday forced the evacuation of about 100 residents and closed an interstate highway and rail routes in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. A total of 26 cars derailed early Wednesday about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> after 84 <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cars somehow became uncoupled during a stop, said a company official. Residents near the derailment were told at about 11 a.m. to plan to spend at least 24 hours away from their homes while authorities tried to defuse the cars leaking liquid propane. `` This has the potential to become a very dangerous situation,'' said <LOCATION> Coconino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. He said hazardous-materials teams from the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> hoped to siphon off the propane through a makeshift rigging of pipes and valves and ignite it in a controlled burn. `` They ca n't offload it, because that would be too dangerous,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` It's too dangerous to move heavy equipment in there because of the potential for an explosion.'' But later in the day, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that hazardous materials experts were considering an alternate strategy, an intricate process of pumping the propane out of the leaking propane cars with special equipment. The process would take up to 36 hours, he said. If it is used, the propane would be taken by truck and would be reloaded on different tank cars later, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The experts hoped to decide on a stragegy by early Thursday, he said. The residents evacuated earlier Wednesday would not be allowed to return to their homes until the propane was completely removed. Authorities sealed off both the railroad right-of-way and Interstate 40 over the 58-mile stretch between <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION>. By late evening Wednesday, the road and railroad remained closed. State police helicopters also closed off the airspace over the wreckage, chasing away aircraft carrying photographers. An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the derailment held up two trains. Two other cars carrying propane, one with a hazardous-cargo label, and 21 others derailed, but they were not leaking. The car with the hazardous-cargo label was believed to be carrying an industrial solvent, and was not considered explosive, officials said. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the train was parked at the <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> pet-food plant in East Flagstaff to drop off one car when the cars became uncoupled and began rolling east down a slight grade. The runaway reached an estimated 40 mph before the cars derailed on a curve. No one was injured, he said. Investigators began a probe to determine why the train sections became separated, but the cause was not immediately determined, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The westbound train originated in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Biggest Pricetag Estimate Yet for Failing S&amp;Ls: $112 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional study places the largest government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nation's failing savings and loans, and says the cost could soar even higher unless action is taken quickly The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says the government should spend $ 112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted mergers. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, will need $ 85 billion over and above the $ 27 billion it expects to collect in fees from S & amp; Ls through 1998. However, the congressional auditing and investigative agency warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise. Most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next year, but offer no firm predictions beyond that. The investigative agency, in a draft of a report to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, regulator of the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, for attempting to rescue failed S & amp; Ls by providing money to private merger partners. The report noted that the insurance fund spends on mergers about 90 percent of what it would cost to simply close insolvent institutions and pay off depositors. However, mergers do not always resolve the problem and, counting tax losses to the government, may well be more costly, it said. `` Regulators and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have resisted massive closings of insolvent savings and loans in the hope that the fortunes of these institutions would reverse themselves,'' it said. `` This hope has proven both futile and costly.'' It noted that industry losses totaled $ 9.4 billion in the first nine months of this year. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said failed S & amp; Ls should be placed into receivership in the next year and most of the $ 112 billion should be spent in the next three years. The bank board has avoided that approach, arguing that massive closings could leave some areas of the nation without service from an S & amp; L and that a flood of repossessed real estate from failed institutions could deepen the regional recession in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Breaking down the $ 112 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said $ 77 billion will be required to close insolvent _ but still open _ <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, which numbered 434 at the end of September. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and the bank board had estimated that closing insolvent S & amp; Ls would require about $ 50 billion. The new report also cites additional expenses, including $ 10 billion needed to finance borrowing by the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000, and $ 5 billion likely to be required for losses that have occurred but have n't been discovered yet. An additional $ 20 billion should be set aside as a reserve against future losses, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The thrift industry can contribute $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion, but the rest `` may have to come from the federal government unless others, such as -LRB- commercial -RRB- banks and depositors, are required to share the cost,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report did not specifically recommend a taxpayer bailout, saying only that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must make difficult choices.''

<HEAD>Aerospace Employment Falls; Flat Sales Predicted into 1990s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Aerospace employment declined by 21,000 jobs in 1988 as the industry recorded its first annual sales drop in 17 years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reason is a substantial decrease in sales to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, hardly a surprise in view of the zero-to-negative-growth defense budgets of the last four fiscal years,'' the association's president, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>, said Wednesday Overall sales volume was projected to reach $ 111 billion for 1988, a reduction of slightly more than $ 1 billion from last year. `` An analysis of orders on hand indicates a defense sales rebound in 1989 but we look for further substantial declines as we move into the early years of the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said. The sales projection for next year is for $ 129 billion but `` our real, inflation-adjusted sales curve for the next few years will be relatively flat,'' according to <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>. Statistics released by the association said the number of jobs in the aerospace industry will drop to 1,307,000 for the year and that there will be 14,000 fewer jobs still in 1989. `` We did not set a new record for sales ... for the first time in 17 years,'' <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said. Still, industry profits were expected to improve to $ 5.1 billion, and the backlog of unfilled orders to reach an all-time high of $ 170.3 billion, the association said. An increase in civil aerospace business, <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said, will offset the military decline. `` We must face this fact,'' <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said at the joint <ORGANIZATION> AIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aviation-Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> luncheon. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must continue to accord top priority to further reduction in the national budget deficit. `` So, barring an unexpected change in the international climate, we must realistically anticipate lower levels of defense appropriations and therefore reduced industry sales of defense equipment.'' <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry is severely handicapped in international competition by trade restrictions imposed by its own government. He called the government's role `` purely administrative and often obstructive'' when it should be an active supporter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. He announced creation of a foundation to be called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, which will pull together everything being done in technology and create a data base for companies and agencies taking part.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> expressed concern Wednesday that his former evangelistic empire would vanish, but officials of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s successor group continued negotiating with their new landlord to salvage some part of the ministry. The fate of the television ministry and church at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was left up in the air Tuesday when <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, a 34-year-old Orthodox Jew, purchased the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> assets for $ 65 million. Since last year, the facilities have been leased to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit religious group created by the bankruptcy court. In a statement Wednesday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, accused in a federal indictment with misusing millions of dollars of his followers' money, said he was concerned that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> would ignore the rights of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called lifetime partners who contributed $ 1,000 or more to the ministry in exchange for free lodging at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s lavish religious theme park at Fort Mill `` Our hearts are broken over the fighting over <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> that was built to bring people together in God's love,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and I still have as our goal to restore <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and all lifetime benefits to the partners who built it.'' But Heritage Ministries President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has met with Mernick three times since Monday, said Wednesday that he expects no immediate changes. `` He -LRB- Mernick -RRB- was very conciliatory in his tone,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who also is pastor of the church. `` The ministry is the heart and soul of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` When you take out the heart, all you have is a cadaver.'' Heritage Ministries officials told viewers of Wednesday's broadcast of `` Heritage Today,'' the successor to the `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' they would continue in their effort to buy all the assets of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` We want to be prepared in any event,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, explaining that a number of developments could occur before the deal was final. `` Some assets he -LRB- Mernick -RRB- may not be interested in.'' Meanwhile Wednesday, an attorney for one of the unsuccessful bidders for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> broadcasting executive <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON>, said his client will fight the sale in court. `` We are going to contest irregularities in these proceedings, and we are very firm in our intention to do that,'' said the lawyer, <PERSON> Faison </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. Tuesday, in bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> raised his offer to $ 65 million, after being the high bidder at $ 36.25 million at an auction the previous day. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> then accepted the offer. When <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON>, who showed up about 25 minutes late, asked to be allowed to bid $ 70 million, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> turned him down. <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON>'s lawyer said Wednesday that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> should not have been allowed to raise his bid <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> indicated that the money the group raised in an unsuccessful telethon effort to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> _ reportedly about $ 5 million _ may be used to buy the assets it needs to maintain the ministry. Mernick would not answer questions Tuesday about the future of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, but said he would unveil plans in the next two weeks for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, which include the satellite network carried on 800 cable systems, 1,700 acres of undeveloped land, a 500-room hotel, a water park, and the 2,000-seat church. When he entered the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bidding in October, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he was interested in the assets `` purely as a real estate deal.'' The Charlotte Observer, quoting sources close to <LOCATION> Mernick </LOCATION>, said he intends to hold onto the undeveloped land for 10 years as its value rises. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> told officials of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> he is interested in maintaining the retreat's atmosphere. `` He's extremely sensitive to the people who have invested,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faces a bond hearing Thursday on the indictment issued last week. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder's attorneys, said he does not expect his client to enter a plea until next month. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> has said previously that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would plead innocent to all charges. A federal grand jury on Dec. 5 indicted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his former top deputy at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy. The panel has accused <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> of diverting more than $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to support their own `` lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles. Two other former aides, brothers <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, each were indicted on six tax charges. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 48, resigned as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> president in March 1987 after it was revealed he had a sexual tryst in 1980 with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her to keep quiet about it.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who ran for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider, is staffing his administration with just what you'd expect: <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insiders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement Wednesday that he is tapping <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to be his secretary of agriculture is just the latest example. He is retaining <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as attorney general, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as secretary of the treasury, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as secretary of education, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> as the White House spokesman. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> associate who served <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as White House chief of staff and secretary of the treasury, will be secretary of state in the new administration. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at both the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will head the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. The national security adviser will be <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who had the same job in the Ford administration. It is not unheard of for newly elected presidents to pick people with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience to do <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> jobs. But no administration in recent memory has had so many retreads as the one now shaping up. `` I think they are his kind of people,'' said <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is an old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hand and these are the people he feels comfortable with.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s whole argument this fall was ` I'm the insider, I understand how government works, I can handle things,''' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, professor of political science and dean of humanities at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. That campaign contrasted sharply with those of his two predecessors. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ran as the ultimate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> outsider, often telling audiences that government, far from being the solution to their problems, was part of the problem. Even <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> picked some veterans of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scene. His first secretary of defense, for instance, was fellow <PERSON> Californian </PERSON> <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who had been budget director and secretary of health, education and welfare in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. Most of his initial choices, however, were people like <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, picked to be treasury secretary after a career on Wall Street, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who jumped from a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the No. 2 job in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> governor and peanut farmer, also took pride in his status as a stranger to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scene. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said before the election: `` If, after the inauguration, you find a <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> as secretary of state and <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> as head of national security, then I would say we failed. And I'd quit. But that's not going to happen.'' It did happen, and he did n't quit. But <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and deputy secretary of defense, and <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, an academic with strong ties to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> foreign policy establishment, were also exceptions. More typical of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s choices was <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> banker he chose to head the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> all had their troubles in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, the former Wall Street executive, was fired as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff after a presidential board blamed him for many of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles in the Iran-Contra affair <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> judge, was ridiculed after he was unable, in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings, to name the prime minister of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or express a view on nuclear nonproliferation, foreign aid or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with Third World countries. He was confirmed anyway and satisfied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> well enough that the president later made him national security adviser and then secretary of the interior. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> left the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration under a cloud of alleged past banking irregularities, then was acquitted of those charges by a federal grand jury. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> were past associates in state government of the former governors who appointed them _ people they knew and trusted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s background for the past 20 years has been in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> orbit, as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Republican national chairman, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in Peking, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and vice president. He, too, however, apparently wants some familiar faces around him. `` Many of the people he knows well personally and he probably implicitly trusts them,'' said political scientist <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>. `` He does n't want high risk.''

 The sudden <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> raises tough political problems for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and suggests disarray within the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in its final weeks. Even while Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other senior officials were making preparations at the White House for Wednesday's historic announcement, President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for failing to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue. Speaking at the Executive Office Building just across the street, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's tough stand against <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. He demanded `` a clear and unambiguous statement'' explicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renouncing terrorism and accepting two major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the right of all states to live within secure boundaries. `` Before we have a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the signals have to be clear, unmistakable, unambiguous,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, biting off each word with decisive crispness. Simultaneously, however, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was giving a news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> seized on as evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman had come around to accepting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions. The result was announcements by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that there would be a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> _ leaving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looking like the odd man out. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, meanwhile, did not explain later at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> news conference how what <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said on Wednesday had differed from what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader had said a day earlier. The day-earlier comments had been declared unacceptable. Having denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa less than three weeks earlier, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suddenly was approving direct dealings with a man he had denounced as an `` accessory'' in acts of terrorism against Israelis and Americans. Asked what was different about <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s most recent statement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said cryptically: `` It was clear. It was not encumbered.'' The decision was in a long <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tradition of policy shifts that always are defended as not policy shifts at all. It clearly backs <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into a corner, now standing alone in shunning the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would not presume to advise another country what it ought to do. `` It's totally for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make its own decisions about what it wants to do, and there's nothing to be inferred judgmentally about what they should do,'' he said. The choice <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> faces is to watch the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its closest friend, make arrangements for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and not participate, or to agree to attend a peace conference with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> now a virtual certainty. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could come under pressure, too _ from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make good on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration renouncing terrorism in all forms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, undoubtedly, will be asked by reporters in the next few days why he seemed so out of step with what was brewing within the White House. In a way, though, he may benefit from the decision taken by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Any political storm caused by embracing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will not fall on him. It's a decision that may have been inevitable, and one he now will not have to make. But he may have to make one just as tough _ whether to support a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was not endorsing statehood for the Palestinians by approving the dialogue. And yet, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s demand for a state carved out of Israeli-held territory will be bolstered by its entry into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s diplomatic community.

<HEAD>Text of Shultz Statement on PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of the statement by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Wednesday in which he announced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will establish a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>: SHULTZ: The <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> today issued a statement in which it accepted <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolutions 242 and 338; recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist in peace and security; and renounced terrorism. As a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared for a substantive dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. I am designating our Ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> as the only authorized channel for that dialogue. The objective of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains as always, a comprehensive peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In that light, I view this development as one more step toward the beginning of direct negotiations between the parties, which alone can lead to such a peace. Nothing here may be taken to imply an acceptance or recognition by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of an independent Palestinian state. The position of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is that the status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> can not be determined by unilateral acts of either side, but only through a process of negotiations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state. It is also important to emphasize that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' commitment to the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remains unflinching. Q: Mr. Secretary, what was it today that changed your mind? SHULTZ: I did n't change my mind, they changed their _ they made their statement clear so that it does n't have the ambiguities in it that earlier statements had, which tended to allow various people to give different interpretations of what was meant. Q: Well, what was different, what was different about it today? SHULTZ: It was clear. It was not encumbered. Q: Mr. Secretary, what about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s record, which only two weeks ago you described as a terrorism record. You called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an accomplice or an accessory to terrorism. You denied him a visa. Are you expunging the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> record and saying `` let bygones be bygone''? SHULTZ: No. When we have our dialogue, you can be sure that the first item of business on our agenda in that dialogue will be the subject of terrorism, and we'll make it clear that our position about the importance of the renunciation of terrorism is central. Q: But what can a dialogue do about people who are already dead? And what does your statement have _ how does your statement bear on the promise <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> made the Israelis? SHULTZ: The promise that <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> made the Israelis, which had to do with 242 and 338, and with the recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Since that time, we have added our insistence on a renunciation of terrorism. Those conditions have been <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> going back to 1975. Our position has not changed. We have stayed with that position consistently. And now, today, we have an acceptance of those conditions in a clear-cut way. Q: Mr. Secretary, have you told the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of your intentions? And can you tell us what their response was? SHULTZ: Everybody has been put on notice repeatedly for _ since 1975, in effect, that if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> meets our conditions, then we're prepared for a substantive dialogue That is well-known. Of course, we have had communications with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as we have with other states and we have been engaged in the last hour or so of trying to call people to tell them explicitly what we are prepared to do, now that there is this statement, but I do n't want to try to speak for others. I'm only speaking for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Q: Do you have any reason to believe that the Israelis would be willing to sit down with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>? SHULTZ: No, I do n't have any reason to believe that. But all I'm telling you is what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies are and this policy has been in place for _ since 1975, and it has been consistently adhered to and now that we see a change in the posture of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, all we're doing is following through on that Our policy remains unchanged.

 Q: Mr. Secretary, do you see this as a single meeting or as the beginning of a process in which there will be a series of meetings and aimed at what result? If it is going to be a series of meetings, where do you want it to go? SHULTZ: The meetings are not an end in themselves. Our object is a comprehensive peace and so our object in any dialogue that we have with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will emphasize our desire for that and our views of what it takes to get there. I made a speech last September on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and set our views as a supplement to the views contained in the initiative that we worked on earlier this year. So our object is not a dialogue. Our object is peace and we will be talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as to others in an effort to move things along toward that objective. Q: Mr. Secretary, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> was at the White House this morning. Was that why he was there? To _ SHULTZ: No, it was n't. Q: Mr. Secretary _ SHULTZ: However, I did talk to Secretary <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> since we got word of this development. Q: Mr. Secretary, your statement at the American Colony was addressed specifically to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> residents in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and not _ specifically not to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Does this dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now mean that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to address that sort of statement to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership as well as to other Palestinians? SHULTZ: That was a statement to Palestinians that I made in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> last Spring, as I remember. Do you have the date of it in mind? I forget. It's been a while ago. Anyway, I sought a meeting with Palestinians and I went to their turf, so to speak and they would not meet and, of course, the word we got was that they were afraid to meet because they were afraid to meet because they were afraid they would be killed if they did. So I went and I made a statement that you referred to, saying, `` Here is what I would have told you if you had come,'' and we issued that statement as a statement of our efforts toward peace and of our recognition, which has been consistent and it's obviously so, that if you're going to get to a peaceful settlement in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, you have to include Palestinians in the process from the beginning and at the end. That is clear enough, and that was basically what I said. Q: As a result of this, Mr. Secretary, are you going to be willing to talk with Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, before you leave office? SHULTZ: What I am doing is authorizing our ambassador in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to make himself available for a direct dialogue, and we are making it clear that this is the only authorized channel of communication. So anybody else who is representing themselves as a channel is not a channel. This is the authoritative channel representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. Now, what may evolve from this remains to be seen, but I think that when it comes to any genuine, substantive discussion, we are in a transition phase and it is basically for the next administration to decide what they do. Q: When will the first meeting be held? SHULTZ: I do n't _ we have seen this <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement; I'm making this response on behalf of the president. I might say, the president, the vice president agree with this. And I'm authorizing now the ambassador in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> to undertake this dialogue, but when there will be a meeting, I do n't know. Q: -LRB- Off mike -RRB- _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has recognized the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the legitimate partner for negotiations, do you feel that there's any reason for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>? SHULTZ: What we are doing as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting our conditions, is establishing a substantive dialogue with them. We hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct negotiations that will lead to peace. How those negotiations are structured, who is there to speak on behalf of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> is a subject that's a difficult one We've worked on it a long time. And I imagine it'll continue to be difficult. But, at any rate, we'll have a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and that dialogue will be designed to find the answers to those questions. Q: Now that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolutions </ORGANIZATION>, and renounced terrorism, do you feel there's any reason that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not now talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>? SHULTZ: I _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has its own views and own policies, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has always made it clear that these conditions that are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions are not necessarily theirs. So, I am not in any way speaking for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It's totally for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make its own decisions about what it wants to do and there's nothing to be inferred judgmentally about what they should do. I'm only saying that for the period since 1975, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has had a position, in effect, that if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> meets these conditions, we will have a substantive dialogue and since they have met the conditions, we are carrying through on our policy and that's the sum and substance of it. Q: Have you conferred with the incoming administration, since you have insisted that you are in a transitional state, and would you be able to tell us what's their stand on it? SHULTZ: The president and the vice president both have followed these developments very closely and they have reviewed each of them _ this most recent development and they both agree that under these circumstances, the conditions for a substantive dialogue which we have had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we are ready to undertake that dialogue. Now as far as what will be the efforts of the administration of president-elect, that is for them to determine and that remains to be seen. Q: Thank you. Q: Sir, is this a condition of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ SHULTZ: I have been dismissed. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> REDMAN </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman -RRB-: Thank you, all.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting that world wheat production could rise to a record level in the 1989-90 season and start a modest rebuilding of depleted grain stockpiles. But an official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> says the council's assertion is premature and that i's too early to make such projections. The council said Wednesday that wheat production could reach a record 550 million metric tons in the 1989-90 season. That would be 5 million tons more than is expected to be consumed and would allow world stocks to rebuild, said the council. A decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons this season would leave an `` uncomfortably narrow margin of security between world supply and demand,'' the council said. If the council is correct about 1989-90 wheat production exceeding use once again and starting another buildup in surpluses, it could mean downward pressure on wheat prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not made any such projections yet. `` Our tendency over time is to have more faith in the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON>, the association's executive vice president here. `` The wheat council projections have a constituency of developing countries that they inform through their various forecasts.'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> added in a telephone interview: `` Whether it exceeds -LRB- consumption -RRB- or not, I think it's heroic to make any predictions about that at this point.'' Stockpiles built up during the wheat glut of the mid-1980s are being depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 1988-89 wheat production caused by droughts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. World wheat production for 1988-89 now is forecast by the council at 500 million tons, 13 million tons below the previous season's figure and 37 million down on the 1986-87 record Tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 1989-90, the council said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has forecast global wheat production this season at 502.5 million tons, about in line with the council's estimate for 1988-89. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not yet projected world wheat output for 1989-90. But department officials have been saying that the recent higher prices and draw-down of wheat stocks are expected to boost plantings for next season.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says that even if depleted soil moisture is replenished, the effects of the 1988 drought will continue to be `` very much in evidence'' next year because of the disruptions is has caused. Net cash income, the difference between cash expenses and cash gross receipts, is expected to be down somewhat from this year's near-record $ 57 billion to between $ 48 billion and $ 52 billion But the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that would still put 1989 net cash income at the fourth-highest level on record. Economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in earlier years, and because of large federal payments. Total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise slightly from this year's record level, the report said. As a result of the drought and the draining of stored inventories, farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30 million acres, but that will increase production costs. Government payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent.

The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> must live up to its statements.

The initiation of a dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives is an important step in the peace process, the more so because it represents the serious evolution of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> thinking toward realistic and pragmatic positions on key issues.

In that light, we view this development as one more step toward the beginning of direct negotiations between the two parties, which alone can lead to such a peace. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' special commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security and well being remains unshakeable. Indeed, a major reason for our entry into this dialogue is to help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> achieve the recognition and security it deserves.

The gunman then fatally shot the 37-year-old <PERSON> Fleurimon </PERSON> and jumped out while the cab was still rolling.

<HEAD>Government Rules Out Further Probe Of Eastern's Financial Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it has no plans to investigate further the financial fitness of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, denying a request from the airline's unions who claim the company is being stripped of its assets. The department said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> `` has demonstrated that it has the financial strength to operate safely and without due risk to consumers'' and no formal fitness investigation is needed. The DOT also chastised the unions representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and machinists for bringing the petition. It accused the unions of engaging in `` a transparent attempt to put pressure'' on management by raising false safety concerns. `` Based on our earlier preliminary investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and our review of publicly available current information, we believe that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> remains fit to operate,'' said the department. There was no immediate comment from the unions. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> decision was `` recognition that the pilots' claims are absolute nonsense'' and `` reaffirms what was decided conclusively months ago'' in another federal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The DOT earlier this year conducted an in-depth look at the fitness of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, including an examination of various financial transactions involving Eastern that had been put into question by the unions. Last June the department said it found <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to be fit to operate, although it raised concerns about the ongoing labor disputes at Eastern. On Wednesday, the department in a sharply worded order denying the unions' petition said the `` only cause for concern with respect to safety issues has been created by the irresponsible conduct'' of the pilot and machinist unions in withdrawing from a joint labor-management safety committee that the two sides had established last July. After Eastern announced in October that it planned to sell its Northeast shuttle operation to billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions withdrew from the safety committees, the department said. On Dec. 7, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, filed its petition requesting that the department reopen its investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fitness because of the proposed sale of the shuttle, the only profitable part of the airline. The pilots union later was joined by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in making the request. The petition argued that the proposed sale of the Eastern Shuttle to Trump amounts to `` downsizing'' Eastern and `` undermining the airline's financial condition ... to the point that it may not survive.''

<HEAD>Trial To Offer Rare Inside Look At Roman Catholic Church</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trial of a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest's claim that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> violated his academic freedom will provide an unusual look at the church's inner workings. The suit was brought by the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> after the university revoked his right to teach theology on grounds that his writings were at odds with the faith. The suit pits <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s claims of academic freedom against the church's contention it has the power to discipline clergy who stray from the orthodox teachings of the faith. Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chancellor of the university, was the first witness as the trial got under way Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who chaired the university's board of trustees when action was first taken against <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, is also set to testify. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> defended the university's decision to revoke <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s `` canonical mission'' to teach <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology after <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> authorities determined his writings were at odds with the faith <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 54, refused an offer to teach ethics outside the university's religious department. The university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest authority of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which had revoked <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s right to teach Roman Catholic theology. As an ordained priest, the university contends, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> has an obligation to obey the revocation of his mission to teach <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> contends he was never conferred such authority and his contract to teach was no different than any other university professor with tenure. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> defended the decision to discipline <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, saying: `` the case of Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> had become a widely known matter. It has caused, in my opinion, a great deal of harm to the church.'' The church has the power to declare that a theologian no longer speaks for the faith `` when it believes a theologian has seriously departed from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> teaching,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said. An investigation of <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s writings, which, among other things, disputed the church's stance on birth control and homosexuality, determined he was `` unfaithful to the role as professor of theology,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said. Because of the case's notoriety, it was important that he be removed from the theology, particularly because of the university's `` unique relationship both with the Holy See and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in this country,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said Founded in 1885 by Pope <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> functions as one of few `` pontifical universities'' in the country that is governed directly by the church. The action was taken because `` it seemed inconceivable to the board of trustees of the university that we could simply join in defiance on the part of Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, said the decision to remove <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> from the ecclesiastical faculty violated academic freedoms specifically conferred on the faculty following a strike over the issue in 1967. Moreover, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s dissenting views, summarized in his work `` Faithful Dissent,'' were well known to the church long before his dismissal earlier this year. `` The actions that have been taken against him are not because of some brand-new heretical position,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. `` If the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of the present case means anything, it means the university guaranteed a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church teachings,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said in pre-trial arguments. But <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baine </PERSON>, who represents the university, said the court had no right to question the church's application of canon law, which governed the relationship between <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> and the university. `` Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> thinks he has n't an obligation to his church to abide by this declaration,'' <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was trying to change the university into something that he `` wants it to be,'' <PERSON> Baine </PERSON> argued. Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> agreed that the court has no power to second-guess application of church law, but ruled that the issue in the case is whether these canons formed the basis of <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s contract <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was implicitly conferred a `` canonical mission'' when he was hired. Following his suspension from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was a visiting professor at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. He currently has a one-year appointment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>.

 A pioneering private effort to help underprivileged students get college scholarships has achieved a graduation rate sharply above the national average, a study concluded. The 21-year-old, privately financed <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> released a study of its first two decades Wednesday showing 80 percent of those who got grants from the program and enrolled in four-year colleges graduated. Nationally, about 50 percent of students who start college receive their degrees, the program said. <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> has assisted more than 57,000 students, most from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> public high schools, since its founding. Last year 3,700 students received specialized help applying for college admission and scholarships, and 540 underprivileged students received grants averaging $ 375. Under the program, counseling is available to all students but only students from underprivileged economic backgrounds can qualify for its direct grants. `` They really helped me a lot,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, 34, who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and is now a sales executive with a concrete supply company. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, the first member of his family to attend college, said <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> provided him with crucial help meeting an array of unfamiliar college admission and scholarship requirements and deadlines. `` As far as filling out paperwork, it was totally new for me,'' <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>, the program's executive director, said the result of the survey showed that `` a private partnership can have a major impact on assisting economically disadvantaged students. ... They can go on to college and be very successful.'' <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> has 21 part-time counselers who visit high schools and meet with students to help them apply to college and seek financial assistance from various sources. Follow-up counseling continues through the campus years. The alumni study was conducted by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Uyeki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> among a random sample of 633 students out of the 8,205 who received direct <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> grants from 1967 to 1983. Eighty-five percent of those surveyed had average family incomes of less than $ 25,000 and more than half were the first family member to attend college. <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> calls itself the nation's oldest non-profit, privately supported college financial aid counseling service. It has been used as a model for similar programs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other cities.

 Yes, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, there really is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, a judge decided after hearing from a jolly, old man who bellowed the familiar `` Ho, Ho, Ho!''

 It was 44 years ago, but to those who were there the horrible but largely unknown atrocity at <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> remains a vivid memory. `` Today we speak for those who endured the unendurable,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Simsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who organized a memorial service Wednesday in honor of 140 American prisoners of war massacred by Japanese forces on Dec. 14, 1944. `` It's a cleansing process, that these men possibly will be remembered by their fellow Americans.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, 67, a deputy sheriff in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was one of 11 men to escape the <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION> massacre, during which Japanese troops lured the Americans into air raid holes, doused them with gasoline and burned them to death. <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> was among the first of the POWs to arrive at the sliver-shaped island in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Japanese forces used the prisoners to carve an air strip out of the jungle. Prisoners were beaten daily. Captured escapees were beheaded. Tiny rations of rice left them emaciated, many weighing less than 100 pounds. Their beards grew down to their exposed ribs. `` I remember every bit of it,'' said <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, who underwent an appendectomy without any anesthesia during his captivity. The morning of the 14th, <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> remembers overhearing Japanese soldiers talking. He said the Japanese believed an American convoy was headed toward <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. After two years of hell, the POWs spirits were finally lifted. `` ` Get to your air raid trenches, the Americans are coming,''' <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> recalled his captors ordering. `` Without a doubt, we thought we were going to be liberated,'' he said. The air raid siren was sounded. The men crammed into the trenches. The next thing <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> recalled seeing was a platoon of Japanese troops entering the camp compound, some carrying buckets, others torches. `` I could n't believe what was going to happen. They threw gasoline in the trenches, then the torches came in and it was just an explosion,'' he said. `` ` My God, they're killing everybody','' the prisoners shouted as <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> watched some of his comrades, knowing they were about to die, run out of the trenches and grab on to Japanese soldiers to take them to death. Some of the Americans had dug a tunnel, thinking they could escape if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops bombed the island. <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> and about a handful of others made it out of the trenches, rolled down a 60-foot bank and tried to run to the channel to swim away. Many were shot down. <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, pinned down by machine gun fire, crawled under a garbage pile and stayed there through the night. The next day, he made it to a nearby cave and stayed there until nightfall, when he swam five miles to another island. The next day, trying to swim across an inlet, he became entangled in a fish trap, eventually saved by a passing boat. <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> and others lament the fact that the massacre of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION> is known by few Americans, but they said the simple memorial service will help heal the wounds of the living and remember the victims. `` We did n't come here with hatred in our hearts,'' <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> told about 40 people who attended the service in the shadow of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. `` We want to remember those who paid the ultimate price.''

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Ag Secretary: Affable But Hard Bargainer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Friends say <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the designated Agriculture Secretary in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, is an able and tough negotiator. Adversaries put the emphasis on `` tough'' but acknowledge his ability to strike a bargain. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has been the nation's No. 1 negotiator on agricultural and other international trade issues for the past 3 -LCB- years. He is widely respected at home and abroad for his aggressive push to make foreign markets more open to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products and for his ability to soften harsh protectionist legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A man who needs very little sleep, runs on a treadmill three times a week and always appears affable and reasonable, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has been an effective ambassador for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers and manufacturers. Cajoling and threatening, he managed to talk the Japanese into opening their market to American beef exporters, and he persuaded the Europeans to import more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citrus fruits. He also spearheaded a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive to stop <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from dumping semiconductors, or selling them abroad at prices below the cost of production. In naming him to his new post, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is `` so widely respected'' that he would have a `` running start'' on plans to open foreign markets even further to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm produce. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> will have a chance to see through a contentious fight with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for the elimination of agricultural subsidies. The next meeting on that is scheduled for April in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. His main opponent in that fight, chief <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, is also a fan. `` He is very good, very skillful, also very stubborn,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said last week as he confronted <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> at international trade talks in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Another participant at that meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., had profuse praise for the 58-year-old <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> `` He's dynamite,'' was the evaluation of the ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's the guy you want to have back-to-back with you in a knife fight.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was considered for the top <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job in 1980 by President-elect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but was passed over because of objections from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations he served as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, running regulatory programs such as meat inspection and animal health, and overseeing a dramatic increase in farm exports. The push for further increasing farm exports has been paramount on his agenda as Trade Representative. Critics say he focused on this to the detriment of other important trade issues. His main emphasis has been on attempts to get an international commitment to eliminate farm subsidies, which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contends distort world trade and work to the detriment of American farmers and exporters of farm products. `` Agriculture is too important to nibble at the edges of reform,'' he repeatedly argued during the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> trade meeting earlier this month. `` It must be changed radically.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> agreed to take the top agriculture post despite an often stated desire to return to the private sector. In his last private sector job he headed the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second largest futures market <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who has four children, grew up on a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farm and still manages a 2,500 property in the town of <LOCATION> Cozad </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Borrowers Wary Of Foreclosure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A survey on home equity loans found most borrowers aware they could face foreclosure if the money is n't repaid, but a consumer group said many people still do n't know what they're getting into when they borrow against their homes The Survey Research Center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that 58 percent of homeowners had a first mortgage, and 11 percent had other loans secured by their equity, or the value of the home beyond what is owed on it. The July-November survey of 2,510 households found that traditional second mortgages _ loans for a fixed amount to be repaid on a fixed schedule _ were held by 5 percent of the homeowners. The newer home equity lines of credit, which allow people to borrow money at their discretion up to an approved credit limit, were held by 6 percent. Eighty-four percent of the homeowners with loans secured by their equity listed foreclosure as a risk should they be unable to repay the money, and another 6 percent to 7 percent mentioned other legal actions as a possibility, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, director of the university's Surveys of Consumers. `` Their caution in using their home equity line of credit ... comes out of this understanding of the consequences of missing payments,'' he said. Among families with approved lines of credit, 31 percent had not borrowed any money, either because the planned need for the money had not arisen or because the credit line was meant to serve as a cash reserve in case of emergency, according to the survey. Among those who had borrowed against their lines of credit, the median outstanding debt was just 10 percent of net home equity, although the median amount the families had authorization to borrow was 32 percent of net equity. `` They're well aware that they're betting their home and they're very cautious about it,'' <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> said Some consumer groups have criticized banks for advertising low rates on home equity loans that are available only for a short period and for failing to disclose important information about conditions and fees on the loans. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> of the private <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said `` the suggestion that consumers generally know the risks they are assuming is not justified'' by the survey's findings. `` We think there are a lot of problems,'' she said. Even consumers who are aware of the risk of foreclosure may be surprised by changing repayment plans, rising interest rates and other conditions that could make it more difficult to repay their loans, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey was supported by 35 corporations, financial institutions and trade associations with an interest in home equity loans. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> discussed the results at a news conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, two of the groups that helped finance the survey.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to start a dialogue with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could increase political divisions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at a time when sensitive talks are under way to form a new government. It could also put <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a collision course with its main benefactor for the first time since the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war in 1982. Initial reactions indicated both major political parties, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move and would stand together in rejecting the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a partner for negotiations. But if the U.S.-PLO talks go well, it will put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join the process. This could deepen the <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> split on the peace issue and thwart talks on a power-sharing coalition. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s new moderation was a `` mirage'' and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never accept the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a negotiating partner. He has argued the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s true aim remains the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a candidate for foreign minister in the next government and a close ally of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the only possibility for a change in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s view was if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> made good on its pledge to abstain from terror. `` Let's say that if a year or two goes by and there are no acts of terrorism, maybe some people in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will look at him in a different light,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> show. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for failing to renounce the violence associated with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, such as throwing firebombs at Israeli vehicles, but he praised <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for having `` learned to say peace.'' The yearloing uprising has claimed the lives of at least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> favors an international peace conference proposed by the Arabs and is willing to trade some occupied land for a peace agreement. Both ideas are vehemently opposed by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who says a U.N.-sponsored forum would be biased against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would become weak and vulnerable if it gave up the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, home to about 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is under pressure from dovish <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> members and liberals allied with the party to encourage the peace process, even with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. If he does so, he will come into conflict with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the possibility of another coalition government may evaporate. `` If the government stands by its position -LRB- opposing talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, I believe the Palestinian uprising and the prospects for war will both grow,'' warned <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a parliament member of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which was allied with Labor in the Nov. 1 parliament elections. `` We are at a crossroads between war and peace. The government must decide now,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dove and former <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aide, said it was `` too early to say'' if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move would have an impact on coalition talks that had appeared to be making headway after six weeks of on-again, off-again negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 39 in 120-member parliament. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has until Dec. 26 to present a new government to President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, has said he could form a government without Labor. It would be made up of small religious and right-wing factions that favor annexation of the occupied territories and more Jewish settlements. But such a government would be weak and isolated internationally, especially if the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration exerts pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join the dialogue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main military, economic and political supporter. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> receives $ 3 billion a year in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, more than any other country, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veto in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has staved off economic sanctions and other anti-Israeli measures. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations have rarely brought pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but in 1982 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> temporarily halted delivery of F-16 fighter planes during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also held out the possibility of increased aid as an inducement to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during peace negotiations that resulted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s only peace treaty with an Arab state in 1979. To withstand such pressure, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> parliament member <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, the son of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, said Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> should present a united front. `` This development highlights the necessity of establishing a national unity government that would withstand this very grave threat,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to open direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> capped a month of intense debate over recent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> overtures, a period in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stood virtually alone in the court of world opinion. The historic decision announced Wednesday came 18 days after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> refused to allow <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was kept out because his organization `` engaged in terrorism against Americans and others.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made clear Wednesday that he was not forgiving the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for its past but said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements earlier in the day recognizing the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism had met standards set in 1975 for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Many nations attacked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s Nov. 26 decision not to allow <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made the decision just 11 days after the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body, had accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for peace talks and world leaders were eager for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to elaborate. The criticism of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> came from all quarters and included assertions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was violating the agreement under which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> serves as the organization's headquarters. Even Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, without specifically referring to the decision, said `` every obstacle'' to the peace process should be removed. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegates passed a resolution denouncing the decision, and only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against it. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> then took the unprecedented step of moving its debate to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where on Tuesday <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made his long-awaited speech and declared, `` Come, let us make peace.'' He recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, condemned terrorism and said peace negotiations should be based on Resolutions 242 and 338 _ the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for opening a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had received advance word <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> might meet the standards and had, according to sources, informed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that he was prepared to announce that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But, after a close examination of the speech, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s language was ambiguous and `` did not meet our conditions.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> then called a Wednesday news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and, carefully choosing his words as advisers whispered to him, read a statement that called for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state to co-exist alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said resolutions 242 and 338 should serve as the framework for peace talks and that `` we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and state terrorism.'' At virtually the same time <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was applauding the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader's Tuesday speech but repeating the standard <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration line that it had not gone far enough. `` I want it clear, I want it unambiguous, I want is so nobody can argue with what's been said,'' said the president-elect, apparently unaware of the clearer statements just made by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. But at the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where again advance word had been received that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was ready to meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions, the day was spent determining whether he had. At 9:30 a.m. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was briefed by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, his national security adviser, and told <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> planned a news conference at which he might use the `` right language.'' Four hours later <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> and reaffirmed that he was ready to authorize dialogue provided <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met the conditions, according to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides. At 4 p.m. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> spoke again: <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had a copy of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement and indicated <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had met the conditions. Less than a half-hour passed when <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and gave him a copy of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement. At 5:12 p.m., according to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and told him they believed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had met the conditions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> immediately authorized the dialogue. The administration notified <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others of the decision. Even before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made the formal announcement, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> issued a statement saying it regretted the move. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made it official just after 6:30 p.m. `` I did n't change my mind,'' he said in response to the inevitable question. `` They made their statements clear.''

<HEAD>Orphanage Pleased To Get Sugar From Moonshine Raid In Time For

 Chefs at an orphanage are cooking up visions of dancing sugarplums after learning they will get two tons of sugar seized in a federal moonshine raid. `` We'll go through this sugar rather quickly,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Baptist Children's Home and Family Services, adding that orphanage workers planned to pick up the 4,400 pounds of Dixie Crystal sugar today. `` We've been doing a lot of dreaming, figuring out what we can do with it.'' The sugar, along with moonshining apparatus that included 576 plastic one-gallon jugs, was seized in September when agents broke up an alleged <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> moonshine operation. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> filed a motion in federal court Monday asking that the government give the sugar to the orphanage in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> agreed in an order filed Wednesday. The order also allows the government to use the sugar as evidence when defendants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> stand trial Jan. 18 on charges they ran a still and possessed mash and untaxed liquor. The sugar would have gone to waste had it been stored as the case worked its way through the courts, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` What we've done in the past is dispose of it in the federal penitentiaries, but the closest one is in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON> said. `` We figured if the moonshine was in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, we could use it here.'' Moonshining has been a problem in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for years, and federal and state agents hoped that by monitoring large sugar sales, they would be able to take a larger dent out of the illegal industry. <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> said the orphanage, which receives funds from Baptist churches, other private sources and the government, has 72 children. About 10 or 20 of the children ranging from ages 5 to 18 will stay at the center during the Christmas holidays while others visit relatives once school is out. Orphanage chefs will use the sugar to make extra holiday sweets for the kids, with plenty of sugar left over for day-to-day use, <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> said. The sugar is valued at about $ 1,500 and will bolster to the orphanage's annual food budget of $ 106,000, he said.

 HISTORY _ Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan of 1947 the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was to have been the nucleus of an independent Palestinian state, but in the 1948 war <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured some of the area allotted to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> annexed the rest.

 THE PEOPLE _ About 850,000 Palestinians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including 400,000 refugees whose families fled the territory that became <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948. Since Israeli occupation began in 1967, 62,000 Jewish settlers have established more than 100 settlements on land expropriated by the government. More than two-thirds of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s 650,000 Palestinian residents are refugees crowded into eight <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> camps, many living in single-room shacks built from scraps of wood and corrugated iron About 8,000 Jewish settlers also live in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> THE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1964 by the Arab League to press for a Palestinian homeland. Its component groups field an estimated 5,500 full-time guerrillas, with probably three times that number in irregular forces. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also operates representative offices worldwide, sponsors student scholarships and conducts other government-like operations. Its legislative body is the Palestine National Couuncil. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s bureaucracy and fighting force, concentrated in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before 1982, was scattered across the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> moved <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> in 1982.

 Many police once thought all the motivation people needed to report crime was a sense of civic duty and a few words from Officer McGruff, the cartoon bloodhound who barked `` take a bite out of crime.'' Not anymore. Police are increasingly turning to cash rewards and morbid crime re-enactments on television to lure <PERSON> John </PERSON> Q. Public to the phone. The police-sponsored `` Crime Stoppers'' genre, most familiar as 60-second spots on local TV, took a giant leap toward <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> last week with broadcasts of `` Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare.'' With help from an independent film company, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police investigators created two hours of televised murder, mayhem and mystery in a plea for clues to the country's worst unsolved serial murder case: the `` Green River'' slayings of at least 40 women in the Northwest. The syndicated program, distributed to 137 stations nationwide, included a re-enacted murder attempt, real footage of police unearthing a victim, and interviews with grieving relatives. Viewers were urged to turn in a crook _ and maybe collect a $ 100,000 reward. `` The show was designed to push an emotional button in the viewer,'' said producer <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Broday </PERSON>. It apparently did. The program, broadcast Dec. 7 and repeated during the past week, drew more than 7,600 calls to a toll-free hotline. Investigators rejoiced at the flood of fresh tips and praised the marriage of sleuthing and the media. `` It's the most effective tool in law enforcement,'' declared Detective <PERSON> Myrle </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carner </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s Crime Stoppers program. The popularity of such programs reflects a `` get tough on crime revival,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurigio </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of a 1986 study on the programs for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are looking to have some impact on crime, alleviate their fears, and regain some control,'' said <PERSON> Lurigio </PERSON>, although he cautioned `` there may be some negative consequences.'' Offering large cash rewards and anonymity may encourage false accusations, and the nightly re-enactments could unnecessarily increase fear of crime, <PERSON> Lurigio </PERSON> said. Crime Stoppers began 12 years ago in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, when police and civic leaders decided they needed a new weapon to fight increasing crime. The premise: grab attention with a televised `` Crime of the Week'' re-enactment, then promise cash rewards and anonymity to anyone reporting any serious crime. The concept took off. More than 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communities now have Crime Stoppers programs, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> police officer and president of <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stoppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which helps set up local programs. Crime Stoppers tips have helped solve more than 210,000 felonies and led to the recovery of $ 1.3 billion in narcotics and stolen property, <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said. In the last two TV seasons, networks and syndicates have created dramatic variations on the Crime Stoppers theme. Not only are the programs popular with viewers, they also are successful. Of 115 fugitives portrayed on <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' 55 are in jail, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> says. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> says its `` Unsolved Mysteries'' has broadcast 50 stories and helped solve 11 cases. On Wednesday, authorities in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> arrested a man suspected of bilking investors of up to $ 3.5 million after they were tipped off by a maid who found a note in his motel room saying, `` The Unsolved Mysteries program was a bombshell.'' The show had featured his case Nov. 30. The police behind last week's `` Manhunt'' program hope the success rubs off on the maddening <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case. More than $ 15 million has been spent hunting for the killer, whose first victims were dragged from the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, in 1982. The murderer now is officially blamed for the deaths of 40 women, most linked to prostitution and street life. The killings stopped in 1984, but investigators say the murderer may have moved on. They're studying whether he might be responsible for at least some of the slayings of more than 30 transients and prostitutes since 1985 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. And the discovery of six female bodies near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, since July, some of them believed to have been prostitutes, prompted police speculation that the killer had crossed the country. During `` Manhunt,'' viewers were urged to report clues not only to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case, but to any serious crime in the country. Calls came in from every state. At least two people said they were the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer. Several others said the killer had confessed to them. Some calls were pranks, and many offered information too dated or general to be helpful. Investigators said it will take weeks to sort through the 3,000 tips that seem initiallly promising. One tip already has produced results, albeit unrelated to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case. Police said two murder suspects were arrested Saturday in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and taken to jail. Surprisingly, that's where many tipsters are, too. `` We get a lot of calls from jails,'' said <PERSON> Carner </PERSON>. `` The old saying that there's no honor among thieves is true. They love to rat on each other.''

 Color-coded registration stickers soon will determine which day of the week private vehicles will be allowed to circulate in this smog-plagued metropolis. The plan to issue stickers in five different colors was one of several anti-contamination measures announced late Wednesday by the federal government. Officials also said holiday school vacations that began Wednesday would be extended until February in the city in a bid to cut down childrens' exposure to health-threatening winter smog. In addition to the restrictions on private vehicles, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also will try to battle its critical air pollution problem by increasing vehicle inspections, prohibiting the burning of tires, plastics and other contaminating wastes in open areas, and setting hours for cargo loading and unloading in the city during the smog season. The announcement did not mention sanctions against violators of the new regulations. Generally, enforcement of most regulations in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is lax. It said that from Jan. 9 to March 21 vehicles observed to be contaminating the air will be taken out of circulation. Beginning Jan. 16, smog checks will be obligatory for cargo vehicles whether they have gas or diesel engines. The anti-burning regulation will be in effect from Dec. 15 to March 21. Additional measures to reduce air pollution will be announced before March 21, according to a bulletin issued by the president's office Wednesday night City spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Manjarrez </PERSON> said officials from the federal health, education and ecology departments would sign an agreement extending the Dec. 15-Jan. 2 holiday vacation until Feb. 1 He said schoolchildren would make up the lost month of classes next summer. There are about 2.3 million students in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> public schools, according to federal government statistics. `` We have agreed to protect the children of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and part of that is to change the school hours,'' <PERSON> Manjarrez </PERSON> said. `` We all know that the thermal inversion layer levels will be worse during the winter and that we have to take measures.'' Last winter, authorities delayed the start of public school classes by two hours to limit exposure. Children often found themselves outdoors on the street in the early morning, waiting for buses while traffic was at its worst and smog at its strongest. <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Aridjis </PERSON>, president of the Group of 100, a leading environmental organization, said the schedule change would do little to restrict smog exposure. School-age children breathe foul <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> air whether they're at school or at home, he said. `` The solution is not to change the school calendar,'' <PERSON> Aridjis </PERSON> said. `` It is not going to change the pollution situation. More drastic measures, such as less traffic, are necessary.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s smog regularly worsens during winter when a layer of warm air traps cold air bearing tons of pollutants near ground level. The phenomenon is known as a thermal inversion. The condition can last for hours, sometimes days. The mountains that ring the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lies, prevent the dispersal of smog by winds; rains are scarce in winter, permitting winds to lift tons of dust bearing particle pollution and dried fecal matter off the dry <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texcoco </LOCATION> lakebed. About 18 million people live in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has come a long way from a guerrilla commando force leader to a statesman. He is the symbol of Palestinians' desire for a homeland, never wavering in his dream of creating a Palestinian state. For nearly three decades the 59-year-old <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has been both revolutionary chieftain and politician, ricocheting between touching the dream and losing control of the movement to rivals backed by other Arab governments. Each setback of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ chased from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1970 and from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 _ was trumpeted as the final demise of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Each time, he returned. And this month he piloted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> through making the concessions demanded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it would open a dialogue. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has denounced him for years as the archterrorist masterminding attempts to destroy the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just last month denied him a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, citing his links to terrorism. But the base of his success has been widespread support among the world's 5.5 million Palestinians. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, his pictures sprout among demonstrators in the year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> seems consumed by his mission for a homeland. He does not smoke or drink, and is notorious for late-night meetings. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, without wife, children or fixed address, says he married the cause when he formed an underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> movement, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, in October 1959. His date and place of birth have never been confirmed, though the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not dispute the version that he was born Aug. 29, 1929, in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Born <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> Ar ` ouf <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, his father came from a prosperous merchant On his mother's side he can trace his ancestry back to <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON>, daughter of the Moslem prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says he smuggled arms to Arab forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, then went to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to enroll in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> University. In 1952, he was elected president of the Palestinian student union in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1957 after taking part in the Suez War as a reserve officer in the Egyptian army. He worked in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> as a government engineer before forming his own successful contracting firm. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1964, and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> brought <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> above ground on Jan. 1, 1965 with its first military commando operation against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> led commando operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Later, he traveled clandestinely through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to organize <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> military units. He was elected <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman in 1969. In 1970, he faced his first serious challenge from an Arab government. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, threatened by the growing power of the Palestinians within his kingdom, moved his army against them. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> escaped one of two acknowledged assassination attempts that year; the second came in October 1971 on an inspection tour in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He says he never sleeps in the same place for two nights running. In 1974, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> granted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer status. An enduring image of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is when he addressed the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> offering an olive branch of peace but wearing an empty holster. In the late 1970s, his guerrillas became embroiled in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war Their strength in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> led <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to invade in 1982. Palestinian guerrillas were scattered from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> after world governments intervened to lift an Israeli siege of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders, disgusted with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalty to commanders who did not stand and fight the Israelis, got Syrian backing to try to unseat him. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in June 1983. Pro-Arafat forces were evacuated from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, that December. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> moved <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and gradually rebuilt a consensus among Palestinian groups. That consensus _ glued together with the uprising in the occupied territories _ led to this month's announced change in the Palestinian position and the projected dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> made a political drive in the last month to convince the world they are peaceful, moderate, and worthy of representing Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.

<TEXT>
 In a rare show of unity, ruling and opposition lawmakers today approved without debate legislation that will raise their salaries by 85 percent on Jan. 1. The two-minute action raised a lawmaker's monthly salary from the current $ 2,550 to $ 4,730, bringing their pay to the level of Cabinet ministers. The bill was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It's passage by the full assembly will be a mere formality. Many South Koreans criticized the steep pay increase as unethical, citing the meager incomes of most factory workers and high inflation. According to industry figures, a footwear assembly line worker with five years of job experience makes about $ 550 a month, including allowances.

 A postal employee pulled a shotgun out at the main post office Wednesday night, wounded three people and holed up in the building with at least one hostage, authorities said. The gunman eluded police for about five hours before agents found him in a room used for coffe breaks during a room-to-room search of the block-wide building, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Volney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. The gunman, who <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said was holding at least one hostage, fired two shots at agents, who then backed off. `` He was barricaded behind a door. As the agents approached he fired,'' said <PERSON> Cesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON>, a post office spokesman. Negotiations with the gunman were being conducted by telephone, <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> said early Thursday. Earlier, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, the gunman got into an argument with a co-worker and pulled a weapon out of a bag. Authorities identified the gunman as <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, about 40, a six-year postal worker. One of the people shot was the person <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> argued with, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. He did not identify the victim or elaborate. `` I was going to mail this box of stuff I have and the security guard came down. He was real excited,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` The guard was screaming, ` There's a guy with a gun!''' Four hours after the incident began at 8:30 p.m., authorities said an undetermined number of postal employees were apparently still inside the building but it was not known if they were being held hostage. About midnight, a dozen postal employees who had been laying low on the vast second floor escaped through a back door, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, leaving about 20 to 30 or the 500 workers on the night shift unaccounted for. `` We still think he's in there,'' he said. `` Some postal inspectors have evacuated. ... They were n't really hostages.'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said the workers who escaped had seen <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> but had n't had any contact with him. The employees were hustled away by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> after they came out of the building. <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> may have had marital problems. `` The information we have at this time ... is that his wife did leave him and left the city. We have not talked to him, but that is the rumor we have at this time,'' <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> said. Two patients were at <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where they were in stable condition, a <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. One person was hit in the thigh and one in the arm. A third person was wounded in the eye and was undergoing surgery late Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a hospital spokeswoman said. `` I do n't think anybody is hurt real bad at the present time,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> McSwain </PERSON>, police surgeon. `` I know nobody has any life-threatening injuries.'' <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> said unidentified relatives were at the scene to assist with negotiations. There was no word if <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was demanding anything, said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, whose agency was in charge of the situation because the post office is federal property. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON>, a postal worker who was working on the ground floor, said, `` I just saw some people come running from upstairs, saying there was a man loose with a shotgun.'' A security guard told police that the gunman might be hiding on the second floor where letter-sorting machines and other large equipment is located. `` There's plenty of places to hide up there,'' <PERSON> Vale </PERSON> said. Special police teams dressed in flak jackets surrounded the post office on <LOCATION> Loyola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> on the edge of the central business district. <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> said the security guard ran to the door to make sure the half dozen or so postal workers and customers in the immediate area escaped out the front safely. `` I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' he said. `` Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.'' Adding to the confusion, holiday shoppers poured out the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> department store to see what was going on. On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time mailman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> walked into the post office in <LOCATION> Edmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, with guns and ammunition hidden in his mail bag and began shooting. He fatally wounded 14 postal workers and injured six others before killing himself. Police, thinking <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> was holding workers hostage, waited outside for an hour before entering the building to aid the wounded and to free employees who had hidden from the gunman. Witnesses said the final shots were heard about 40 minutes before police entered the building.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups warily supported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's historic decision to sit down with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, while Arab-Americans said the policy reversal rekindled hope for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. Several American Jewish leaders said they trusted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in their decision to open a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but called on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to back his words of peace with action. `` We understand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having set standards for speaking with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> having met those minimum standards, that it is appropriate for us to live up to its commitment,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It is a first step. Now we must watch to see if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will match words with deeds.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the government's decision to end its longtime rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a party to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts an `` important step forward.'' `` The dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to say yes to the very issues that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has now acceded to,'' <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> said. `` Our hope is that the dialogue is productive and that peace is now possible.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, legislators from both parties cautiously endorsed the move. `` It may be a blind alley, but an alley worth treading with eyes open,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. `` This dialogue in no way mitigates our steadfast support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But I hope <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will at least be willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy attempt.'' `` In the interest of peace and security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and all parties in the region, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has no sensible choice but to begin a dialogue,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> foreign operations appropriations subcommittee But, he added, `` the proof will still lie in deeds and not words.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who nearly a decade ago was forced by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to resign as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative, applauded the decision, saying, `` People were not ready for this before now.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enter into `` a substantive dialogue'' with the Palestinian group after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he was renouncing `` all forms of terrorism.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who only two weeks ago barred <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and called him an `` accessory'' to terrorism, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in which it met all three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue. The conditions were acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions affirming the right of all states to live in peace, recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism. While the Israeli government swiftly criticized the move, many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups were reluctant to do so, reflecting the dissension that has marred relations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and many American Jews over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hardline policies on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said in a statement: `` We neither approve nor disapprove. We accept it. We trust the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The first action the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should take in its conversations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should be to demand that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for the destruction of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Unless and until the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> translates its words into the deed of repealing that covenant, there can be no progress toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, dedicated to the study of the Holocaust and promoting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in world affairs, said it was disappointed with the decision. `` While both President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have proven themselves to be the staunchest friends of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the road they have chosen to embark is fraught with danger,'' said the statement read by a spokesman, Rabbi <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. The response from Arab-American organizations, while generally favorable, was in some cases tinged with bitterness. M.T. <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said his organization was `` not impressed.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should talk to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and urge it not to shoot at the Palestinian youth nor to use American airplanes to attack Palestinian camps in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 A snowstorm forced rescuers to leave two men stranded on a glacier in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for a second day after their small plane made an emergency landing on the remote river of ice. Once visibility improved today, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials planned to send a helicopter to pick up the men, who messaged by radio that they were unhurt and wearing survival gear, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON>. `` They gave every indication that they're still in very good shape, are nice and warm, have plenty of food and can stand another night on the glacier,'' <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said Wednesday. The 1940s-vintage <PERSON> Grumman </PERSON> <PERSON> Widgeon </PERSON> amphibious plane landed about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> on Grand Pacific Glacier on Tuesday afternoon, <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. The plane was not damaged and the men were waiting inside it. The men contacted passing commercial and military jets by radio late Tuesday and their distress calls were relayed to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. Pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 38, and passenger <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, 31, of <PERSON> Gustavus </PERSON>, were flying from <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gustavus </PERSON> when they were forced to land about 45 miles from their destination for an unknown reason, <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON>, said both men were professional pilots who had recently restored the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> dispatched an H-3 helicopter Wednesday morning to rescue the men, but the craft ran into a snowstorm and poor visibility forced it to land at <LOCATION> Gustavus </LOCATION>, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. Later attempts by two helicopters to reach the glacier were also unsuccessful, <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. `` They were making good headway and then they got up to that Cross Sound area and the weather got real bad,'' <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 transport plane made several passes over the glacier to communicate with the men. The last communication came late Wednesday as the plane passed over the area on its way back to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> to refuel, <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said the cause of the two men's emergency landing probably was not due to the weather, which was clear in the area Tuesday.

 Prosecutors' sorry attempts to prove their divorce-fixing conspiracy charges involving <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> would have gotten them hauled off `` The Gong Show,'' said a lawyer for the former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s lover. In a summation filled with sarcasm and punctuated by one-liners that drew laughter from the judge, jurors and spectators, attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> ridiculed the government's case Wednesday, calling many of its 34 witnesses `` biased, disgruntled, disturbed people.'' `` Never have so many days, so much time, energy and taxpayers' money been spent on such trivial pursuits, such diversionary issues, while bringing to you so little truth to support the government's case,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> told the The defense was expected to continue that tack today as closing arguments resumed in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, Miss America 1945 and once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence a judge's rulings in her lover's divorce by giving a city job to the judge's Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, her lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, and former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 75, who made interim rulings in <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s bitter divorce, are charged with conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, said in his summation that the government failed to prove `` beyond a reasonable doubt'' that any conspiracy existed. `` There is no direct evidence of the secret agreement at the heart of this case,'' he said. The prosecution, which summed up its case Tuesday, claims that Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly payments to his estranged wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, by more than half in exchange for the $ 19,000-a-year city job Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> gave to the judge's daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, who was to conclude his statement today and be followed by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lawyer, said Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> `` acted in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case as a judge is supposed to act. She crafted a decision which, in her mind, was fair and reasonable.'' The defense maintains that <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s payments were cut because they were too high to begin with and that when child support, mortgage payments and other expenses were added on, the cut was minuscule. Leading off for the defense, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, ridiculed the government's case, saying prosecution witnesses should have been hauled off stage in mid-story like contestants on `` The Gong Show.'' Making faces, pacing, flailing his hands and jabbing his fingers in the air, he described <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who testified for the prosecution, as `` sick and disturbed'' and said the government `` put her up to taping her own parents.'' `` There's got to be a level of decency below which even an advocate will not sink in a quest to make a case,'' he said, adding that prosecutors `` stooped so low that they scuffed their knuckles on the pavement.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 39, admitted that she has undergone electroshock treatment for clinical depression and that she took documents from her mother's home to prosecutors and taped two phone conversations with her mother. Talking about the divorce that spawned the trial, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> quipped: `` That was a perfect case for Judge <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> _ for <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> scoffed at the credibility of <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s former British-born housekeeper, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrod </PERSON>, and likened her gossipy testimony to the public television series `` Upstairs, Downstairs,'' about a wealthy British family and its servants. `` How important was it that you learn <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> did n't want people to know she was sleeping _ this is the'80s, now _ that she was sleeping with <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> asked rhetorically. He maintained that <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s ex-wife had instigated the case because she was dissatisfied with the divorce settlement. `` What a tragedy that we're here because <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> has sold the government a bill of goods that wo n't hold up,'' said <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>.

<HEAD>State Orders Full Environmental Review for Walden Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government is best that governs least, according to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>, but a state order for a full environmental review of a proposed project near his beloved <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> may keep development of the area at bay. `` We are <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>'s caretakers,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVillars </PERSON>, the state's newly named secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which called for the lengthy review on Wednesday. `` Our responsibility is to ensure that we take every reasonable measure to avoid or minimize damage to this historic area. Nothing short of a full review will fulfill that responsibility,'' <PERSON> DeVillars </PERSON> said. At issue is a proposed <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> by the developer <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to build a 148,000-square-foot office building and a 518-car parking area. The land is near where <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> worked on his masterpiece, `` <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>,'' while living there in solitude beginning in 1845 for two years in a hut on land owned by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>. In the book, <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> writes about the importance being close to nature. The land later was donated to <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and eventually to the state, which maintains the heavily used recreation area around the pond. Some preservation groups have urged the state to buy the land and add it to the <ORGANIZATION> Walden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> surrounding the pristine, historic site in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. But despite passage of a record $ 500 million bond for land purchases, state officials say they can not afford to buy it. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Linde </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, said the state's `` 11th-hour'' decision had no basis in law or logic `` The record proves that <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> has complied fully with every applicable state and local environmental and zoning law and regulation,'' <PERSON> Linde </PERSON> said. `` We will review the state's request carefully.'' The site proposed for the development was cleared 25 years ago and is now zoned for commercial development by <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, whose officials are eager to add the development to the town's tax base. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily agreed to an initial evaluation of the project under the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Environmental Policy Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MEPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. After the company filed a report, the state decided to order a full <ORGANIZATION> MEPA </ORGANIZATION> review _ an often lengthy and expensive process _ based on the developer's information, staff analysis and public comment. The key issue cited by the state in ordering the review was concern over traffic surrounding the area. <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state-owned reservation on the edge of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, an affluent town of 12,500 about 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

 ISRAELI REACTION _ Most leading officials express shock and dismay at the decision. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, says, `` We believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will realize very soon what the true policies of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are and will then realize that its latest step has not furthered the cause of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, says his government regrets the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move and does n't recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a `` viable partner for negotiations.''

Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> calls the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision a `` sad day for all of us'' but adds, `` We ca n't turn our heads away or put our heads in the sand and say nothing happened.''

 _ In <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he told a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews that his group accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and condemned all forms of terrorism A written statement issued after the meeting said the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> `` accepted the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a state in the region'' and that the council `` declared its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism,'' an apparent reference to Israeli actions in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At a news conference after the meeting, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> accepted two states _ a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and a Jewish state, in practice <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Is that clear?'' But on terrorism, he seemed less straightforward than the statement he endorsed. He said he remained committed to his 1985 <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> declaration, which called for ending terrorism outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied territories but not inside. Referring to the Palestinian rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, he added: `` The uprising will continue week after week until the end of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of our homeland.

 A discarded letter that aroused a maid's suspicions led to the arrest of a fugitive from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> whose case was featured last month on the television program `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' authorities said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, wanted for allegedly bilking investors of up to $ 3.5 million in 1984, was arrested Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rangers after they were tipped by the maid, who had cleaned <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s motel room at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION>, said chief ranger <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> `` She found a discarded piece of paper, apparently a letter he had written to someone and then thrown away, while cleaning the room,'' <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said. `` She noticed it had a phrase in it saying, ` The Unsolved Mysteries program was a bombshell.''' <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said the maid notified rangers, who went to the room at the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> and found the man gone. They went into nearby <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and spotted his car at a restaurant, where he was apparently having breakfast, <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> left, rangers followed and pulled his car over on a road that leads around the lake. He was arrested and turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said he did n't know if the maid, whom he did n't identify, had watched the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program. `` I'm impressed that she did something,'' he said. `` A lot of people would n't have picked up on that.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 38, disappeared from <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in 1984 with the contents of the safe of his S.D. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of investors claimed they lost a total of $ 3.5 million through <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>, who offered eight to 24 percent returns on real estate and accounts receivable, authorities said. A 1984 prospectus listed assets of $ 2.8 million. Disappearing along with <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> was his former wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, and partner, <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, authorities said. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> later served prison time for his part and Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, but was never charged, authorities said. After the TV show was broadcast Nov. 30, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents tracked <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where he was living as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a coin and baseball card dealer. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicodemus </PERSON> said his agency had lost sight of Cox three years ago before finding him again in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. `` We had earlier traced him to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nicodemus </PERSON>. `` Then, we kind of lost him and he was out of pocket solid for three years.'' Friends in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> drove into town three years ago in an old car with a few boxes of jewelry for sale. He went to work at the Treasure Cove Coin Shop, and recently opened his own baseball card store next door. He had married in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> and the morning before the TV show aired, told his wife that he had to fly to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> due to a death in the famil, authorities saidy. He later called and said some people were after him about some money and he would never be able to come back, authorities said. <PERSON> Nicodemus </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, charged in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> with sale of unregistered securities, will most likely be returned to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Consul General Accused of Providing Cover for Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Yugoslav consul general here, indicted for allegedly laundering $ 1.5 million, gave diplomatic cover to two men involved in smuggling documents and computer information to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, officials said. An affidavit by <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodess </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent, alleges that <PERSON> Bahrudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> consul general, provided cover for the men, both of whom are American citizens, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported today. According to the affidavit, one of the men, Yugoslav-born Vjekoslov Spanjol, of <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was `` the second in command of <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The other man was identified as <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, Spanjol, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and two other men were indicted Dec. 1 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on charges they engaged in the money-laundering scheme. Spanjol and Cole were able to get documents and computer information from <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contractors in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area and smuggle the data to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> via diplomatic pouch, the newspaper said. Ms. <PERSON> Hodess </PERSON>' affidavit said all of the defense contractors involved had contracts with an office-cleaning service operated by <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It alleged that <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON>'s employees obtained discarded documents and other information from the contractors' trash Federal law prohibits the delivery of information relating to the national defense to any foreign government. The affidavit was filed as part of an ongoing investigation of <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> and the others, the newspaper said. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, Cole, <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON> and two other men were charged with funneling $ 1.5 million to bank accounts controlled by an undercover <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent. <ORGANIZATION> LBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch of a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> bank, also was indicted. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, at the request of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, asked Wednesday that a seal on the affidavit be lifted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucklo </PERSON> granted the motion, allowing the case file to be open to the public. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> declined to comment on the contents of the affidavit. The affidavit disclosed that Cole held several meetings with an undercover <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent, which were secretly tape-recorded, and stated that he and <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON> already were involved with laundering money in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> for a drug dealer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Before being conferred diplomatic cover by <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON> concealed the currency in their luggage, the affidavit states.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a major political triumph for <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that could breathe new life into the comatose <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process _ or touch off a violent backlash by Palestinian radicals. There is also the possibility that factions outside the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> such as the one led by terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> may simply unleash a new wave of terror to wreck the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's diplomatic initiative. If the breakthrough fails to produce solid political gains, particularly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate, it could trigger attacks by radicals within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> who fear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has made too many concessions in the Palestinians' 40-year-old struggle for a homeland. The <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, which reconciled with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last year after a four-year split, has already accused him of `` capitulation'' by renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, who leads the Syrian-based breakaway Fatah-Uprising faction, on Wednesday branded <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` a traitor ... for his surrenderist concessions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> enemy.'' <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, known by his nom de guerre of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, split from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 with other dissident factions in a Syrian-backed mutiny launched to protest <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s moves toward moderation. After fierce fighting, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his loyalists, already forced out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion, were driven out of their last Lebanese stronghold. Capt. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, commander of the extremist Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, declared angrily in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Wednesday night: `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has recognized and offered four-fifths of the Palestinian land to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership has accepted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is there to stay and seeks a Palestinian homeland only in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, abandoning the dream of regaining all of pre-1948 Palestine. `` By renouncing violence and terrorism, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is condemning anyone who uses the gun against the Israeli occupier,'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has offered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> what he does n't have. The land of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> is not the property of any organization or any individual.'' West German authorities six weeks ago arrested 13 suspected <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION> members who they said were planning terrorist attacks. They also seized explosives. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his top lieutenants would be targets along with Israelis and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> if the radicals go on the warpath again. For 15 years, since he first showed signs of moderation, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has had to battle not only the Israelis, but Palestinian extremists and hard-line <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states led by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> has long sought to wrestle control of the Palestinian cause from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Gunmen led by the renegade <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, wanted by a dozen countries, have assassinated a score of key <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aides over the years in a campaign to silence the moderates. Others have been killed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service, <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>. The Israelis' latest victim was <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s right-hand man, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, who was slain in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on April 16. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed Wednesday to open direct talks with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> after he told a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> renounces `` all forms of terrorism'' and said it explicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. That was an abrupt turnaround by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which only the day before had said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had not gone far enough to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue. Last month, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> steered the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile and highest decision-making body, to implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist by accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. It also declared an independent Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where Palestinians have been in revolt for a year. Radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions disagreed with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s moderate strategy, which was primarily aimed at persuading the Americans to deal directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, the prime mover behind the wave of airliner hijackings of the 1960s and 1970s, and the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> nonethless reluctantly went along with the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> declaration `` in the interest of unity.'' But <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last month: `` We're backing your efforts because this is what the majority wants. But we do n't believe moderation will pay. `` We ca n't wait forever. If you fail, you have to come back to this council to say so and we can then decide the future course.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Few Women Reach Top of Medical School Faculties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medical schools have done a good job of recruiting women to their faculties but still rarely promote them to be deans, department heads and tenured professors, a study published today concludes. The report found that even though their numbers have grown dramatically, women still hold only a small share of the best jobs at medical schools. A decade ago, 8 percent of women faculty were full professors. Now 9 percent are. By comparison, 32 percent of men faculty are professors. This means there are few women role models for young doctors. `` Indeed,'' the report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> concludes, `` there are few departments in any school in which a student can readily find a woman physician in a senior position who is happy with both her professional life and available to give the student pointers and support.'' However, just why women doctors do n't make it to the top is still unclear. `` We do n't know if the women are choosing not to be on the tenure track or whether it's a whole series of smaller decisions that are made for them because there is n't a flexible schedule for taking care of small children,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON>, who directed the study and is head of women's programs at the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Among the findings: _ Even though women make up 19 percent of medical school faculties, they hold 7 percent of the full professorships _ During the past 10 years, the number of women on medical school faculties has grown from 6,249 to 10,840 _ Two of the nation's 127 medical schools are headed by women, compared with none a decade ago The number of medical school departments led by women has increased from 56 to 70. _ One-third of medical school students are female, up from one-quarter 10 years ago The work is a followup to a study co-authored seven years ago by Dr. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Heins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` The numbers look better,'' <PERSON> Heins </PERSON> said. `` There are more women students and residents. But in terms of women in top positions, really nothing much has changed.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said she doubts that women fail to reach the top in academic medicine because of frank discrimination. `` Something tells me people would have found their way to my telephone if there was outright discrimination based on gender,'' she said. `` I think we have gotten to the point in the faculty review process where people seriously try to be fair.'' Typically, junior faculty members are given seven or eight years to earn tenure. If they fail to get it, they leave or take non-tenure track jobs. But they rarely are given a second chance to earn tenure, which is a crucial step toward high-level positions in medical schools. Whether or not young doctors get tenure rests largely on how many research papers they have published. <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said other studies have shown that women faculty members do less research than men. <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said it's possible that a woman doctor with small children `` gives up her research interests because she is already working 60 hours a week teaching and taking care of patients. The research and publishing that are necessary to present oneself for tenure are lost.'' She said medical schools could make tenure easier for women by providing more flexible schedules, parenting leaves and opportunities to work toward tenure later in their careers.

<HEAD>Study: AZT Reverses Mental Impairment of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS drug AZT can improve memory and attention and ease other mental problems that are frequent symptoms of AIDS, a study published today shows. HIV, the AIDS virus, attacks the brain as well as the body's immune system Mental lapses can be the first signs of the disease. The latest study, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, confirms earlier reports showing that AZT can relieve these mental symptoms, at least in their first stages. The drug, also known as zidovudine and Retrovir, is the only medicine approved for AIDS treatment. While it does not cure AIDS, AZT relieves victims' physical symptoms and prolongs their lives. The latest work, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was part of a larger study of the drug's overall safety and effectiveness. Of 262 patients who participated, nearly half were found to have some neurologic impairment when the study started. Sixty of these people were randomly chosen to take AZT, while 69 got placebos. Two months after treatment started, those who got AZT scored significantly better on tests of attention, memory, motor skills and general mental speed. People with full-blown AIDS improved more than those who had the pre-AIDS disease called AIDS-related complex, or ARC. `` These data are also important because they show that the neurologic dysfunction caused by HIV infection may be reversible to some extent,'' the researchers wrote.

<HEAD>Rodent Tests Poor Way to Evaluate Chemicals for Cancer Risk, Study
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lengthy testing in rats and mice to predict whether a chemical poses a cancer hazard in humans usually fails to provide enough information to justify its cost, researchers asserted today. Most chemicals should be classified instead on the basis of short-term lab tests, says a cost-benefit analysis in the British journal Nature. Concerns over rodent testing have been raised before, centering on the uncertainty over how relevant they are for predicting how a chemical will affect people. The researchers said 30 percent of chemicals tested for cancer-causing potential in one program behaved differently in rats than in mice. Rodent tests are probably no more predictive for humans and could be much less, since people are more biologically different from rodents than rats are from mice, researchers said. Before deciding on whether to use a long-term rodent test, regulators should consider results of short-term testing and the costs to society of misclassifying a chemical, researchers said. For most chemicals, proceeding to the rodent tests would not be worth the cost, they said. Social costs of misclassifying a chemical include additional cancers if a dangerous chemical is wrongly labeled safe. If a safe chemical is erroneously labeled cancer-causing, society loses access to a potentially valuable compound or pays for needless precautions.

 An unemployed truck driver is accused of raping two women in separate assaults along the same densely wooded stretch of highway where the bodies of six women have been discovered since July, officials said. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges he abducted and raped a woman at knifepoint in August 1987. He was held at the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail on $ 20,000 bond. Afterward, a second woman who identified <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in a composite photograph accused him of raping her in July, said <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON>. `` The two rape cases have come out as a legitimate result of this investigation'' into the highway serial killings, said <PERSON> Pina </PERSON>, although he declined to confirm news reports that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is a suspect in the slayings. `` There's a good list of suspects we have. They're all being checked out,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday. `` I think we are definitely closing in. The circle is becoming smaller and smaller.'' The partially clad skeletons of six women have been found since July in a six - to eight-mile radius along Interstate 195 and Route 140 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pina </ORGANIZATION>, declined to say whether <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a divorced father of two who lives with his mother and grandmother, had been among those questioned in the slayings. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said he believes the six killings were likely the victims of the same killer or killers and that the victims all had ties to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON>, a forensic pathologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> called in to examine the victims' remains, said all six women apparently died in a similar manner, but he declined to detail his findings. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has also worked as a welder and lives about 10 blocks from the <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, was arrested at home Tuesday. He was charged with aggravated rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the public defender representing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said his client `` has been charged with only one crime. I think that to try to link that to any other events is very unfair.'' <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said an arraignment on the second rape charge would not be held unless <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> posted bail. `` At that time we would slap the other warrant on him, but barring that he's just going to sit there -LRB- in jail -RRB- until he goes before the grand jury on the other charges,'' he said. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> scheduled a pretrial hearing on Dec. 21 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also will appear at that time on charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an unrelated fight, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said.

Torture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today that torture cases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have increased as the government has escalated its fight against communist insurgents. `` Military intelligence agents are reported to have subjected detainees to severe beatings, electric shocks, stabbings, near suffocation with plastic bags or water, and sexual abuse,'' said the report by the London-based group. `` Similar abuses in police stations have been reported. Soldiers on patrol have been accused of rape and other abuses in villages suspected of sympathizing with rebel forces,'' it said. This `` pattern of torture'' has re-emerged even though President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government enacted constitutional and legal measures to outlaw brutality, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in the report. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> believes that immediate action is still needed to enforce legal safeguards against incommunicado detention, to investigate fully all allegations of torture, and to bring those responsible to justice,'' the report said. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today, `` I am in touch with the progress of these cases. The final reports are not yet in as not all witnesses have been heard.'' She urged human rights organizations to submit reports of violations to a new committee she created this week to investigate alleged abuses. Last Saturday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> acknowledged violations were continuing but blamed most of them on the communist rebel <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. She said human rights abuse was not a policy of her administration and that it was unfair to blame the problem exclusively on the military. `` They have to give us a chance,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` We have to investigate. We can not be <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which just publishes reports. ... They are being unfair.'' Amnesty said it knew of no instance of a military or police officer being convicted of a serious human rights offense since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power in February 1986 in the military-civilian uprising that ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Alleged members of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> and its military wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, are among those who have said they were tortured, the report said. Amnesty said it is aware the rebel army has killed captives.

<HEAD>British Commander At Ill-Fated Battle Of Arnhem Dead At 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>, the British commander at the heroic but ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arnhem </ORGANIZATION> who tried to capture a bridge over the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has died, his family reported today. He was 87. <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> died Tuesday at his home at Port of <LOCATION> Menteith </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Stirling </LOCATION> in his native <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. No cause of death was stated. As commander of the First Airborne Division, <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> was at the forefront of the battle in September 1944 to capture a bridge over the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Arnhem </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. He survived many narrow escapes, and was portrayed by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> in the 1977 movie `` A Bridge Too Far,'' which was based on the battle. The battle was the climax of a U.S.-British operation to exploit German disorganization following their retreat from <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, after the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the D-Day landings three months earlier. The plan aimed at ending the war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before the end of 1944, thereby avoiding the Allies' long, conventional offensive with which the war eventually ended in 1945. The plan was to capture five river and canal bridges in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to open a way for an armored advance into the north German plain before the onset of winter. It required the American 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions to capture bridges at <LOCATION> Eindhoven </LOCATION> and Nijmegen and the British First Airborne Division to capture the one at <LOCATION> Arnhem </LOCATION>. Simultaneously with the parachute and glider landings, a ground advance of 64 miles was planned by the British 30th Corps from the <LOCATION> Meuse-Escaut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> along the same axis. The American operations succeeded. But the British, whose air drops had to be staggered because of lack of sufficient aircraft, encountered German forces and were able only to capture the north end of the Arnhem bridge. The Germans, who had found plans of the entire operation on the body of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier shot down in a glider, heavily out-gunned <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>'s 10,000 troops. Bad weather and German assaults on the 30th Corps' advancing armored column, meanwhile, denied relief for <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>'s troops and their airhead was steadily reduced. <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> and his men fought with heroic courage for nine days. But with their ammunition and food virtually at an end, their casualties rising rapidly and no hope of relief reaching them in time, <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> ordered a break-out. There was no British surrender. A total of 2,163 of the 10,000 troops who landed at <ORGANIZATION> Arnhem </ORGANIZATION> fought their way to safety in the American area, which the 30th Corps had consolidated. Another 1,350 were killed in the battle. The rest were taken prisoner. The failure to capture the Arnhem bridge was reported as `` a bridge too short'' to bring victory. <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> narrowly escaped death when a German shell destroyed a jeep he was about to use. On another occasion while he was in a house, a German soldier appeared at a window. Before the German could fire, <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> shot him dead. Later, while making a personal reconnaissance, <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> was cut off from his own headquarters. He made his way back through enemy fire so dense that at one stage he was given up for dead. A total of five Victoria Crosses, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest decoration for bravery, were awarded after the battle among <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>'s men. After the war, <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> became director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s part-time reserve, during its reconstruction. He was later appointed commander of British forces in British-ruled <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, which later became part of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, and from 1952 until his retirement in 1955 was the commander of British troops in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He is survived by a wife, three daughters and a son. Their names were not immediately available.

<HEAD>Young Troublemaker Receives Harsh Sentence For Stolen Lottery

<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON> was dreaming of riches when he tried to redeem 47 stolen state lottery tickets last June. He found out the tickets were worth 15 years in prison. In tears, the 18-year-old high school dropout with 32 juvenile convictions was led from court after <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sholts </PERSON> balked at pleas for leniency and imposed the harshest sentence possible. `` He's graduated to the major leagues,'' <PERSON> Sholts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON>, scheduled for a February trial on other charges of dealing in stolen goods, was convicted last month of trying to receive a free ticket for each of the tickets stolen from a Juno Beach beauty salon. <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON>, said his son planned to appeal the sentence. `` It's sort of obvious the state attorneys are out to get him,'' he said. `` He's not really a hardened criminal.'' Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jacqui </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbonneau </PERSON> recommended the sentence based on <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON>'s prior juvenile record. The elder <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON> said his son has been in jail since his conviction, and `` that probably did more to straighten him up than anything he did in the juvenile system.'' <PERSON> Pezzuti </PERSON> went through the juvenile system without being punished much for his crimes, mostly burglaries and automobile thefts, say family members. `` He thought, ` I'm never going to get in trouble.

 Four businessman face up to 17 years in prison if convicted on charges they tried to illegally aid Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s campaign by funneling money to an opponent of his chief rival. The five-count federal indictment handed up Wednesday contends that $ 120,000 was used for an advertising campaign in support of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallen </PERSON>, who ran against <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Republican Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON> in 1986 `` We were not involved in any way, even indirectly,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. According to acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Feess </PERSON>, the defendants solicited some 55 contributors to write checks to <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stripe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, which produced a TV ad for <ORGANIZATION> Vallen </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> told a news conference that the people who wrote checks were reimbursed for amounts running from $ 1,000 to $ 4,000. He declined to say whether the check writers knew they were violating election laws. `` The individuals were told different things by different people,'' <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> stressed that <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> knew nothing about the plan and had no role in approving it. There was also no evidence that anyone on <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s staff was involved. `` We have absolutely no evidence that Senator <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> knew or approved of this action,'' he said, adding there is no indication that it had any influence on the outcome of the election. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> narrowly defeated <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON>. <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goland </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> was the moving force in the alleged scheme. <PERSON> Goland </PERSON> was charged with conspiring with <PERSON> Sandore </PERSON> <PERSON> Habalow </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was charged with aiding and abetting the alleged contributions by acting as a conduit through which funds were passed to the media company.

Although he was best known as a champion of military air in his more than 30 years of public service, <PERSON> Symington </PERSON>'s popularity at home was largely based on his battles for local projects. <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in 1901.

 A plainclothes policeman who became the fifth <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officer killed this year may have been shot during an undercover cocaine transaction `` for the fun of it,'' an investigator says. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, who left his police desk job three years ago to work undercover on drug raids, was killed during a shootout that also left a suspected drug dealer dead and two others wounded, authorities said. Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> described the department's mood as somber in what has become the deadliest year ever for the police force. `` Four was unbelievable,'' he said. `` Five was just _ I do n't know. You do n't know what to say.'' Police said Wednesday that <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>'s killer apparently did n't know the 17-year veteran was an officer when he delivered bogus drugs to <LOCATION> Cadena </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>'s assailant threw the fake drugs inside the car in which the officer was sitting, then shot him at close range with a semiautomatic rifle Tuesday. `` The drug was bunk,'' said narcotics division Capt. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said. `` Essentially, they killed him for the fun of it.'' <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, 43, was shot in the chest, abdomen and both arms. He was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> about 30 minutes later. The drug suspect, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jocimino </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was shot in the chest and back by a backup police officer, authorities said. He died later at Parkland Memorial Hospital, said an emergency room supervisor. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 20, was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Parkland </LOCATION> with wounds to the chest and abdomen, while <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 17, was in serious condition with wounds to both legs, hospital officials said. Police said both <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> have been charged with capital murder. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> also was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. Police Chief <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON> a `` model officer,'' said that all of the officers apparently followed the correct procedure during the undercover operation and that the presence of additional backup officers probably would not have prevented the shooting. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police have been under fire from some city council members and community minority leaders, who have accused police of being too trigger-happy. A memorial service was planned for <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON> today at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>

 A high school cheerleader left paralyzed from the waist down when she fell on a concrete floor while attempting a difficult stunt will receive $ 2.1 million from the school district, a teacher and former principal. The settlement involving <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> McAll </PERSON>, 18, was announced Wednesday. Miss McAll was injured in 1987. `` She was a super athlete before she was hurt,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. `` She would be glad to give the money back to get back in the condition she was in.'' The settlement requires the county <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>' insurance company to pay $ 100,000, the maximum the school system can pay in a personal injury case Insurance companies for the teacher supervising the cheerleaders, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, and the former principal at <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>, settled at $ 1 million apiece. Miss McAll was injured when two girls tossed her into the air and she attempted to land on another cheerleader's shoulders after performing a back flip, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. It was the first time she had attempted the stunt. Miss McAll suffered a broken back and injured her spinal cord. The lawsuit alleged that the board allowed cheerleaders to perform difficult gymnastic maneuvers without protective mats or spotters to guard against falls. It also claimed cheerleaders did not receive adequate training or supervision. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said the school system's cheerleader rules did not mention safety. `` They had things about gum chewing, lengths of the cheerleaders' skirts and gyrating motions,'' he added <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the board's attorney, said Miss McAll `` assumed the risk and and knew the dangers and plus she signed waiver of liability'' in case of injury.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> assigned to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the most experienced and knowledgable American diplomats on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs. Colleagues say he enjoys telling about the time he was held hostage by Palestinian terrorists for several hours in 1970 as a junior political officer in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> _ and walking away from his captors. `` He loves to recount this story,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` He was standing there as the press conference was going on and he just walked away. He bears them no ill-will. It was a great adventure.'' <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Patchogue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is fluent in Arabic and French, has served in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and is a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. He was named Wednesday by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as the `` only authorized channel'' for what <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said would be a `` substantive dialogue'' with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> political headquarters is in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, the capital of the North African Arab nation of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>'s office referred calls today to the embassy press office. Information Officer <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> said the ambassador made a brief telephone call to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to make the first contact. He said he did not know when the first direct meeting would take place. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met East German officials in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today, and it was not known when he planned to return to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Between foreign postings, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as director of Arabian peninsula affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and as deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. From 1985 until his assignment to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> in March 1987, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> shifted over to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to serve as deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. The anecdotal highlight of his career came in September 1970, when guerrillas of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> _ a radical faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ diverted three airliners to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> and took the passengers and crews hostage. As <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> has told the story to colleagues, he was kidnapped on the streets of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and taken with other hostages to a large news conference at a downtown hotel. Noting his captors's attention was diverted, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> edged in among the journalists, then slipped out and walked away, the American diplomat said. When his absence was noticed, the guerrillas sent teams out looking for him _ including one that passed him on the street _ but he made it to safety in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. `` Those were in the innocent days,'' the diplomat recalled. `` It's almost hard to remember the days when you just did n't kill diplomats.''

 The surprise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> produced shock today in official <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> circles and celebrations in Arab neighborhoods. A slogan sprayed on a wall in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> read: `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position is a victory for the uprising and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> diplomacy.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the American turnabout represented a `` sad day for all of us'' and one firebomb in the occupied territories would `` put to shame'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s commitment to end terrorism. But <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should launch a new peace initiative to counter the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s latest diplomatic achievements. He proposed letting Palestinians in the occupied territories elect alternative leaders to negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We are facing a new situation,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I hope <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will say to the Palestinians: ` Stop shooting and go voting, Give up your bullets and go to your ballots.''' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement sparked rejoicing among residents of the occupied territories. `` Thanks to the uprising, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are now working together,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter and editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, dozens of Palestinians celebrating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision marched through the streets chanting pro-PLO slogans and carrying banners reading `` Yes to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Yes to the Palestinian state.'' `` For the first time, I feel the Americans are starting to listen to the Palestinian voice, and the voice of peace,'' said a mosque preacher in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> and others credited Palestinians' year-long revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year-occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with moderating <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> positions and paving the way for talks with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The uprising pressured the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership to take such positions,'' said <PERSON> Saed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter and businessman in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio called the decision a `` historic turning point.'' `` Israelis woke up today to a whole new political reality in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said army radio correspondent <PERSON> Oz </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview, `` We believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will realize very soon what the true policies of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are and will then realize that its latest step has not furthered the cause of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move could further divide <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two major political camps and upset sensitive negotiations to bring <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc together in a unity government. One sign of new friction was <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' renewed an attack on Likud for thwarting his exploratory contacts with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> last year, which he said would have prevented the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> initiative. On July 31, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> cut all administrative ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to fill the vacuum. In the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, Israeli seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also warned <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> indirectly today that he would not join a new government that failed to actively pursue peace. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> politicians angrily denounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and close associate of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has breached its policy -LRB- of not talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the credibility of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been compromised. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government has been either duped or they are deceiving themselves. The American government will regret what they have done once they realize who they are dealing with,'' he said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision was welcomed, however, by a leading member of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which was allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the Nov. 1 parliament elections. `` It's a great victory for American policy,'' said <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a parliament member of the small party. `` With this new success, we are at the beginning of the peace process.''

<TEXT>
 Two policemen accused of repeatedly kicking a man during a riot have been indicted on assault charges, becoming the first officers charged in the August melee in <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The indictments announced Wednesday were based largely on a videotape shot during the Aug. 7 riot by an aspiring filmmaker, said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. The tape will be presented at their trial. So far, 120 brutality complaints relating to the melee have been filed with the police Civilian Complaint Review Board. Seven officers face department trials; this group does not include either of the indicted officers. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatto </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Giglia </PERSON>, 25, were charged with kicking <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Arihood </PERSON>, who lives near the park on the city's <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. The assault charge, a misdemeanor, is punishable by up to a year in jail. <PERSON> Gatto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giglia </PERSON> pleaded innocent and were released on their own recognizance. The officers, who joined the force in 1985, were suspended without pay. Their lawyer, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Librie </PERSON>, called the charges `` outrageous'' and said they `` will be vindicated at trial if not before.'' Arihood, a 42-year-old construction worker, was chased, beaten and kicked during the confrontation between police and hundreds of demonstrators protesting a 1 a.m. curfew for the park, the district attorney said. At least 52 officers and 18 civilians required hospital treatment for injuries suffered in the clash, which focused attention on police crowd-control tactics and led to the grand jury investigation. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said seven more officers would be charged in the riot.

<TEXT>
 Some foreign rescue teams have given up hope of finding more survivors in the rubble left by the Armenian earthquake, and they are heading home, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disaster relief official said today. However, Soviet officials said the rescue effort would continue and denied reports that stricken cities would be bulldozed to prevent an epidemic. Voices and other signs of life in the ruins dropped sharply after Monday night, when temperatures plummeted to below freezing, said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Disaster Assistance office, at a news briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The hope of finding any more -LRB- survivors -RRB- is ended,'' she said. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that rescuers were still searching. On Wednesday, Soviet Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> vowed to continue the effort because 60 survivors had been found in the previous 24 hours. Soviet media reported looting of fur coats from the rubble, tents from relief supplies at the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> airport, and even jewelry from corpses. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said cargo is now being shipped from the airport under guard. Soviet officials say the Dec. 7 quake killed 55,000 people in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and left about 500,000 of the area's 700,000 people homeless. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that 48 villages had been destroyed, in addition to the city of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. The larger cities of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> suffered major damage, and Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said another 52 villages also were damaged. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that 21,755 bodies have been counted and identified so far. Rescue teams with search dogs from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sallot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> that Soviet authorities had ordered them home, saying they were ready to blast the ruins of buildings in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and bulldoze the rubble to prevent decomposing bodies from starting an epidemic. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> denied similar reports from French media on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Some foreign rescue workers said they planned to keep combing the crumbled buildings for life, despite fog and rain that was turning to snow. `` We continue to look for people, especially with dogs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Allemagne </PERSON> of the relief organization Doctors Without Borders. `` We think there are chances for about another week to find a few people.'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said the dogs' sense of smell becomes overwhelmed with the stench of death after several days, and they can no longer find survivors. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamillow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said his team found two survivors Tuesday but none on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` But the house where we dug Tuesday also seemed hopeless, so we do not have the right to leave,'' <PERSON> Tamillow </PERSON> said. Snarled supply lines also have hampered the relief effort, and Pravda quoted Gen. Lt. V.C. <PERSON> Dubinyak </PERSON> today as saying some of the medicine and other cargo pouring in from around the world was being stolen from <LOCATION> Zvarnots </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. Authorities have recovered more than $ 400,000 worth of stolen goods, he said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Movsisyan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> volunteer for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said today that 20,000 tents should have been delivered to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> but no one knows what happened to them. Police caught one man with four foreign tents and three boxes of Bulgarian canned meat stolen from the airport, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today, quoting <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Eren </PERSON>, deputy interior minister of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Eren </PERSON> saying a man from the village of <LOCATION> Abobyan </LOCATION> was caught stealing watches, jewelry and medicine from bodies in <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, warning of the worsening weather, appealed Wednesday for heavy-duty tents, blankets and stoves for at least 20,000 Armenian families left homeless. `` It is freezing at night, and it is much colder in the villages,'' d'Allemagne said. `` There are very few tents in villages, and there is no heat.'' Snowfall and hazardous road conditions in the mountainous region also have hampered the relief efforts, and the next few days are expected to bring more snow and strong winds of up to 45 mph. Fog delayed the arrival of flights from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and relief workers arriving by plane could n't find enough buses to take them to their destinations. `` The airport in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is a total mess,'' d'Allemagne said. `` There are planes and people all over the place, and nobody can find anybody else.''

Welles made numerous changes before air time to smooth the transitions between the music and `` news flashes.'' `` I thought it was a pretty good price for six days of work,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said after an anonymous buyer snapped up the broadcasting relic. `` Of course, I was making $ 75 a week then for weekly radio shows.'' The broadcast boosted <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s career. He went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where his screenwriting credits included `` Casablanca'' with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, for which he won an Oscar. `` It was resting in my file,'' he said. When friends came to visit, he said, they `` wanted to see the Oscar _ they never asked me about this.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> did n't know at first what a stir his realistic script had caused. Tired from around-the-clock work, he went home to sleep during the broadcast. The next morning, he heard people on the street talking about `` invasion'' and `` war.'' `` I rushed into a barber shop and said, ` Are we at war?' The barber held up the newspaper headline -LRB- about the panic. -RRB- It was very strange,'' he said. Afterward, `` They raised me to the magnificent sum of $ 125'' a week.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Epic Restored For Re-Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-six years after the premiere of `` Lawrence of Arabia,'' the Oscar-winning epic will be re-released with scenes that had been cut from the original and a new look and sound created by a $ 600,000 restoration. The re-edited `` Lawrence'' will be just as its director, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>, intended. `` ` Lawrence of Arabia' was the first film I saw that made me want to be a moviemaker,'' said director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> and Video Preservation. The film institute and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> announced the re-release on Wednesday. The center will receive proceeds from a series of benefits at which the restored film will premiere: Feb. 4 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Feb. 5 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and Feb. 12 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The 2 -LCB- years of work done on `` Lawrence of Arabia'' were `` the most expensive, extensive and difficult film restoration ever attempted,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an archivist who conducted the restoration for the institute. `` Lawrence of Arabia'' won Academy Awards for best picture, director, color cinematography, color art direction, sound, editing and music, but <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>'s original editing plan was not followed in the rush to get the movie ready in 1962. Lean, 80, rerecorded lost parts of the original sound track with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, who starred as T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, who played King <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON>. New lines were added. Missing ones were redubbed. `` All of their voices have mellowed,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, `` and so we had to change the harmonics by using computers.'' Existing prints of the film were in terrible shape, said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. She and filmmaker <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> are chairmen of the institute's film-preservation fund. `` Parts of the film had been cut and lost, and the color was appalling,'' <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said. `` But now the film looks brand new. The color is perfect, and it's the cut that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> wanted.''

<HEAD>Call to Postpone Elections, Tamils Threaten Boycott</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Professional, civic and religious leaders today urged the government to postpone presidential elections because of ethnic violence that has claimed at least 88 lives this week. Separatist Tamil rebels called for a boycott of Monday's balloting, blaming two main candidates for assassinations and fighting that wracked this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island for five years Also, soldiers said they captured an underground hide-out of Sinhalese extremists waging a campaign of terror and intimidation to overthrow the government. Four rebels were killed and 23 surrendered, said a military spokesman who insisted on anonymity. Hours earlier, he said, the Sinhalese radicals raided a southern village and killed eight people. They left notes warning, `` This is the fate of government spies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for 30 professional, social and religious societies, said President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> should call off the elections because of escalating violence by the the Sinhalese extremist group the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. A five-member opposition group called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday `` We asked him to put off the election as already we feel it will not only not be fair and free but held under tension,'' said a spokesman. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has not commented, but called a special Cabinet meeting for Saturday. The front said the government can not conduct a fair election and urged the 9.3 million voters to boycott polling. Opposition politicians, the powerful <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> clergy and labor organizations repeatedly have urged <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> to help defuse the crisis by forming a caretaker government of all political parties and suspending emergency regulations imposed May 1983. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, is prohibited by law from seeking a third six-year term. The 82-year-old leader has said he will dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and step aside Tuesday. Opposition leaders say that will be too late. Sinhalese extremists say a government peace accord offering limited autonomy makes too many concessions to minority Tamils who are fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. Nearly 10,000 people have died since the war started in 1983. Mainly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of the island's 16 million people, contend they are denied jobs, education and development by the majority <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>. The biggest Tamil group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, today called for an election boycott. They charged the two main candidates _ <PERSON> Ramasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ were `` instrumental in creating the ethnic conflict and have been responsible for the genocide of Tamils.''

<TEXT>
 Former heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> suddenly has taken responsibility for a flurry of recent phone calls to politicians and journalists, following reports that an `` <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> telephone impostor'' had made the calls. `` I've been making the calls,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told a news conference on the steps of the Capitol on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Constitution had reported last week that <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told sports columnist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindred </PERSON> he was not responsible for the phone calls, which the newspaper said were aimed at promoting projects for personal gain. At his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> acknowledged that he had told the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper he did not make the phone calls. But he said he made the denial in order to escape questioning by Kindred, who `` kept following me around.'' `` I told him I did n't make the calls just to get him off my back,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper reported that an `` <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> voice'' this year had called at least six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, two administrative assistants, 10 press secretaries, nine journalists, 14 senatorial aides, then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, counsel to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON>, managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and the Atlanta Constitution, said, `` We absolutely believe that everything we published was dead on the money and nothing Mr. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has said today changes my mind about that.'' `` <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> on more than one occasion has said he did not make the phone calls to politicians,'' <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON> said. `` He has said that to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindred </PERSON>. He has said that to at least two other friends of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s. On one occasion other than today, he has told us he did not make the calls.'' The newspapers' report suggested that many of the calls may have been made by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who, according to associates quoted by the newspaper, does a convincing impersonation of the former champ. At his news conference, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> told him that the newspaper story `` was crazy.'' `` How can somebody use my voice?'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> had set up meetings last spring with several politicians, including Sens. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., as well as with `` I did this because I had things I wanted to say,'' he said in a hand-written statement. `` Now that I am not boxing, I want to fight poverty, world hunger and etc.,'' the statement said. `` I also campaign for people I trust and believe in, like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON> -LRB- who became an assistant attorney general -RRB- and others. `` My life is full of controversy,'' he said. `` So do n't be surprised, because I will be making more phone calls.'' Asked how the original story had come about, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said Kindred `` kept following me around, asking me did I make phone calls to senators. He followed me so much, I just said, ` No. I have n't made no calls.' So, he was n't writing and did n't have no pen. I looked up and a week or two later and read in the paper that <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> did n't make the calls. I'm here to tell you, it was me. I did make the calls.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> had impersonated him. He described the attorney as `` the best friend a man can have.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says employers whose workers are killed or injured on the job can be prosecuted for murder, manslaughter or assault under state laws and can not seek refuge under federal workplace safety laws. The department, in an opinion released Wednesday in response to a request from a congressional committee, said criminal penalties in the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act do not pre-empt state and local criminal laws. `` We see nothing in the -LRB- act -RRB- or its legislative history which indicates that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended for the relatively limited criminal penalties provided by the act to deprive employees of the protection provided by state criminal laws of general applicability,'' the department said. The opinion flies in the face of several recent state court rulings throwing out criminal convictions against employers whose workers were injured through violations of federal job safety standards.

 A man was spared the electric chair and sentenced to life in prison for murdering a state legislator with blows from a hammer. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 18, wiped away tears as he was taken in shackles from the courthouse Wednesday after sentencing in the robbery and slaying May 17 of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>, a 64-year-old Republican from western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted earlier Wednesday. The jury deadlocked on the death penalty, giving Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> no choice but to sentence <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to life in prison without chance of parole. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Telek </PERSON> in the head, dumped his body in a suburban street and stole about $ 100 and <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>'s car after the legislator left a late-night poker game. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was arrested later that day, driving <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>'s car. A hammer that witnesses said matched <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>'s wounds was found in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bedroom. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified that he he took the car from an acquaintance and found the hammer in the car. The murder, believed to be the state's first involving a sitting legislator, prompted a review of security at the Capitol. <PERSON> Telek </PERSON> was last seen alive in the building's underground garage following the card game. `` I'm innocent,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Why should I be happy to get life for something I did n't do?

A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military honor guard loaded the remains, each in metal caskets topped with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, onto an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane during a solemn 50-minute ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. He said the plane took off for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> will determine if the remains belong to any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` They presented possible names associated with some of the remains,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. `` The remains are all associated with incidents in the northern provinces. They said they were found in lots of different circumstances and some of the remains were found by local villagers.'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the Vietnamese also turned over information on 12 other missing Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified Vietnamese sources as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will step up the search for American MIAs and has agreed to accept more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams to conduct searches. The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved 27 sets handed over April 6. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said a four-member team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic experts examined 45 boxes of other remains in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and found some they recommended be analyzed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earlier reports had said 80 sets of remains were examined. The other three teams searched <PERSON> Binh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tri </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nghe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tinh </ORGANIZATION> provinces in north-central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, looking at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane crash sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. Their 10-day project ended today. Investigators focus on 70 `` discrepancy cases'' where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says Vietnamese authorities should have information, including cases of captured airmen who were never returned. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said Vietnamese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical experts would meet in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible repatriations and discuss future projects. Since the war ended, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned remains of 172 Americans which have been identified by the Army laboratory. Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Today's repatriation will be the seventh since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy, reached agreement in August 1987 with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to end months of deadlock on the MIA issue. The first American combat troops landed in then-South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in March 1965. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Peace Accords in January 1973 halted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighting in the conflict, which claimed the lives of about 58,000 Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975. Bitter political bickering between <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has often blocked accounting for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says it will not consider normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> withdraws all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and resolves the MIA issue. In <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials were continuing a joint excavation today in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province to try to determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today that a Dutch woman broke the law by being at the scene of a <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> demonstration during which Chinese police shot her in the arm. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> violated a law that forbids foreigners to mingle with Tibetans during riots. She was among at least 13 people injured during the protest Saturday in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the Tibetan capital, in which Chinese officials said a Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk was killed. Western witnesses said they saw two bodies, including that of a small child, and that Tibetans told them seven people were killed. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> also violated customs regulations by bringing into <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> a book by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled former leader. The book, `` My Land And My People,'' is banned in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because it advocates <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> that she was reading the book to learn Tibetan. She said police confiscated the book and her passport. Earlier this week authorities barred Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> from leaving <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, but gave her permission to leave Wednesday at the request of the Dutch government. Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> and other Western witnesses said Saturday's protest began when about 30 Tibetans walked silently into <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s central market square behind a monk carrying the banned flag of pre-Communist <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The witnesses said police opened fire on the crowd without warning. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media maintains the police gave a warning first and then fired in the air. Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> she stood not among the demonstrators but with a large crowd of curious onlookers. She said police continued firing at her and others even as they ran from the scene in panic. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> refused to say if any formal charges had been brought against Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>, adminstrative and consular attache at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said today that authorities told him no charges would be filed. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not acknowledge that Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> was shot by police, and only spoke of her being `` slightly injured.'' She said a bullet entered her left arm and exited through her shoulder. <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists seeking the return of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and an end to 38 years of <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule have demonstrated repeatedly over the past 14 months. Saturday's confrontation was the third protest to end in bloodshed. According to Western travelers, at least 38 people were killed in violent clashes with police on Oct. 1, 1987 and March 5. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> headed <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s civil administration before Communist Chinese troops entered in 1950. He fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959 during an abortive anti-Chinese uprising.

The former <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> senator, who died Wednesday at his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was the nation's first <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary and built a reputation as a principled politician. He died of heart disease, said son <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Symington </PERSON>. He was at first a champion of military air power and big military outlays, but opposed the Vietnam War, became increasingly critical of defense spending and `` excessive secrecy'' and was an opponent of the F-14 fighter. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> recalled the 1960 Democratic convention and events that could have made <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> vice president. `` The day before the decision was to be made, Senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, ` I'm now offering the No. 2 position to Senator <PERSON> Symington </PERSON>.

 At least six bombs exploded today and late Wednesday in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities, and police said 13 people were injured. A leftist guerrilla group claimed responsibility. In the worst incident, a powerful bomb went off late Wednesday night one block from the presidential palace, injuring five people. Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was not at the palace when the explosion occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist urban guerrilla group, said it planted the bombs to mark the fifth anniversary of its founding Wednesday. A spokesman for the group telephoned several news agencies, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In Quilpue, a city 95 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a firebomb planted at a public transportation depot totally destroyed a vehicle Wednesday evening. Police said 8 people suffered minor burns. Several <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> neighborhoods suffered blackouts which police blamed on bombs. It was the second straight night of similar bomb attacks. At least 10 bombs exploded Tuesday in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities, causing property damage but no injuries. In another Wednesday night attack, a bomb partially destroyed a small stretch of railroad track just south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, halting traffic for several hours, according to police.

 A Soviet emigre with close links to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians and army officers was convicted today of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and sentenced to nine years in prison, his attorney said. <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>, 43, was convicted in a closed <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> district courtroom of espionage and having contacts with a foreign agent, said attorney <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zichroni </PERSON>.

The trial was held behind closed doors since Sept. 5. No details have been given of <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>'s spying activities.

 A 41-year-old Swede was remanded in custody today on suspicion of killing Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, raising hopes for a solution to the mystery which has traumatized <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for nearly three years. Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> filed the remand order in <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> a day after the arrest of the man, whose name was withheld by authorities. Prosecutors said he denied killing Palme. The move means that authorities feel they have enough evidence to make a case against the suspect and may hold him indefinitely for further interrogation. He was arrested Wednesday and, after a full day of questioning, was booked `` on suspicion of having committed the murder,'' Deputy Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morath </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot as he walked home with his wife from a late-night movie Feb. 28, 1986. `` There is reason to believe it will be a difficult case,'' said <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljefors </PERSON>, the lawyer assigned to defend the suspect. He is the first person arrested on suspicion of being the mysterious gunman dubbed `` the Grand Man,'' who followed Palme for several hundred feet after he left the Grand Theater and then shot him. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said witnesses identified the suspect in a lineup as the Grand Man, apparently a key factor in the decision to arrest him formally. Investigators have been sharply criticized by several government inquiry commissions for mishandling the manhunt and squabbling among themselves. The chief detective in the case has been replaced twice. `` The police's inability to find the murderer has created a national trauma in our country ... and undermined the citizens' faith in the legal system,'' the Aftonbladet daily said today `` If the murder of <ORGANIZATION> Olof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palme </ORGANIZATION> is n't cleared up it will remain like a sickness in Swedish society ... That's why a lot of people hope the suspect arrested Wednesday really is the killer,'' it said in an editorial. Palme was a four-term prime minister of this neutral nation and a leader of the world disarmament movement. Investigators refused to officially release information on the suspect, but Swedish police reporters were given access to his record. Reports said he has 63 convictions and has spent the last 22 years in and out of prisons or psychiatric wards for dangerous criminals. The man was convicted of stabbing an alleged drug addict to death with a bayonet in 1970 just a few yards from where <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot 16 years later. Police offered no possible motive, but news reports said the suspect has spoken in a hostile and threatening manner about Palme in the past. The initial inquiry focused on a political motive. Ousted Iranian President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Palme </ORGANIZATION>'s slaying when the prime minister discovered and stopped a Swedish company's illegal arms shipments to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>First Commercial Reactor Gets Heave-Ho</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHIPPINGPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lifting a 1,000-ton reactor vessel from its underground site at the nation's first commercial nuclear plant was the hard part, but officials still have to take the 41-foot vessel 7,800 miles to the dump. The reactor pressure vessel and neutron-shield tank, packed with concrete, were lifted from the ground Wednesday at the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> nuclear plant and placed on a specially made transporter to be taken to a storage site to until spring. The vessel then will be put on a barge and shipped 7,800 miles via several rivers and two oceans to a military dump in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor in the world to be dismantled. Several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed. The raising of the reactor pressure vessel is the most dramatic stage of the five-year dismantling of the plant, dedicated by President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1957 and retired in 1982 after generating about 6.5 billion kilowatts. `` Everything worked just like we expected it to. It's been very successful,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant. Representatives of the two companies responsible for the $ 5 million operation expressed satisfaction about the job. `` This is not the biggest lift ever made, but it's one of the most complicated,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rigging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It took about six months just to get ready for this.'' Wednesday's big move was also the federal government's attempt to prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably, providing a model for utilities when their reactors have outlived their usefulness. `` You've got to take reactors from the cradle to the grave. If you ca n't handle the burial, there's some question of whether you should be handling a reactor at all,'' <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON> said. Even success for the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> operation will not solve the problem facing the commercial nuclear power industry of where to dispose of high-level commercial waste. While waste from <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> is going to military dumps in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a national repository for spent fuel that was to open in 1998 probably wo n't be open until the next century, <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants will reach the end of their 30 - to 40-year useful lives by the year 2000 Almost all of the 12,000 metric tons of spent uranium from private reactors is being stored in holding ponds. Low-level radiation is left in the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> reactor, but `` unless you attach it to your body and wear it as an undergarment, there is no danger,'' <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON> said. Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so the site 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> can be returned to unrestricted use. The decommissioning is expected to be completed by 1990 at a cost of $ 98 million. The cylindrical reactor will be rolled to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and placed on a 200-foot barge in the spring and shipped via the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers, the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Roman Catholic Order Expels Activist Priest in Haiti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> order said today it had expelled an activist priest in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> it accused of instigating violence and exalting class warfare. The priest was the apparent target of a September attack that killed 13 people. The Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> had been at odds with superiors of his <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> order in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for some time. He had been ordered to leave his homeland and go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by Oct. 17. But <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, 35, defied the order and a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> order, the Rev. <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, said he is still on the island. A communique by the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his behavior, which they described as `` in contrast with his <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> and priestly vocation.'' `` The type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious contrast with the clear will of the founder -LRB- of the order -RRB-. In addition, the incitement to hate and violence, the exaltation of class struggle, go directly against that fidelity to the -LRB- teaching -RRB- of the church that forms a living part of the Salesian spirit.'' It called him a `` destabilizing'' element for Haitian Roman Catholics. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has led calls for an uprooting of the vestiges of the former regime of <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who was overthrown in 1986. In September, <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was the apparent object of a bloody attack on his church in the Haitian capital of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> during a Sunday Mass by thugs linked to the ousted regime. Thirteen people were killed and more than 70 were wounded. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> escaped. The massacre provoked another military coup, in which rank-and-file soldiers ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and replaced him with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The statement said the action by the order was `` painful'' but that there was no way <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> could remain a <LOCATION> Salesian </LOCATION> without changing his ways. `` The Salesians continue to pray for <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, still nourishing the hope of a sincere fraternal embrace as soon as he wants it,'' the statement said. The order's spokesman said the decree, which was ratified by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> last week, did not change <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s status as a priest.

 Federal health officials today announced a new AIDS study that will focus on heterosexual men and women at high risk of contracting the fatal disease because of multiple sex partners or other factors. `` The sexual transmission and progression of AIDS among heterosexuals is virtually unexplored territory,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, one of the nation's leading AIDS researchers who will head the study in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. `` In effect, we will be helping to write the book on this subject,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and Dentistry of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the study is to be conducted among 2,000 heterosexuals in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, over a five-year period. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the institute, said the purpose of the study is to develop more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in a population that is not homosexual or using intravenous drugs. Only about 4 percent of the adult AIDS cases can be traced to heterosexual contact, but such sexual conduct accounts for 30 percent of all AIDS cases among women, the <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> said. The study will concentrate on heterosexuals with a history of what is considered to be high-risk behavior for contracting AIDS. The factors include: _ An average of 10 or more sex partners a year _ A history of sexually transmitted disease within the last five years _ Sexual contact with persons, such as homosexuals or intravenous drug users, who are considered to be at high risk for AIDS _ Those infected or exposed to fungal, viral, retroviral, bacterial or parasitic infections that are thought to increase the risk of acquiring AIDS Intravenous drug users, a group with one of the highest rates of AIDS infection, are excluded from the study. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> were selected for the study, the <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> said, `` because they are located in inner-city areas populated by large numbers of HIV-infected drug users, a potential reservoir of infectivity for heterosexuals.'' HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the organism that causes AIDS. A thousand heterosexual men and women will be recruited for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> portion of the study. They will come from counseling and test sites set up by the state in three health facilities in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and from a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> hospital. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> study will concentrate on recruiting heterosexual women, but a select group of men who are sexual partners of female members of the study group also will be sought. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> study also will seek steady male sexual partners of women who test positive for AIDS after first testing negative. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cohort will be recruited from clinics in the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> area, and from the sex partners of the AIDS population in the area. Drs. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHovitz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> will head the second study. A data collection and coordination center in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, will be headed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Strict patient confidentiality is to be observed in both study areas, the <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> said the goal of the studies is to determine the natural history of AIDS infection among heterosexual men and women who have no history of intravenous drug use; to examine sexual behaviors associated with spread of HIV in such a group, and any biological or environmental cofactors that affect the spread and severity of the disease. The institute is awarding five-year contracts to conduct the research. The cost for the first year is about $ 4 million, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION> is one of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and is the agency primarily responsible for directing the federal government's scientific study of AIDS AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering the victim incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. It also is spread from an infected mother to an infant during or just after birth. As of Dec. 5, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 79,823 Americans, of whom more than half, or 44,826, have died since June 1, 1981, according to federal statistics. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> General Assembly today voted overwhelmingly for the convening of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and for temporarily placing the Israeli-occupied territories under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the action. The vote on the resolution came after the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> drew a widely positive response. The final tally was 138-2, with two abstentions, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not participate in the vote, and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> voted yes with reservations, saying they did not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which was mentioned in the resolution. The vote closed out a three-day debate on Palestine which was held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to grant <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to speak at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The main resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> calls for the convening of an international conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices `` with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on an equal footing ...'' It requests the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to establish a preparatory committee for convening the conference. The resolution `` affirms'' principles for achieving comprehensive peace, including `` the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory occupied since 1967, including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and the other occupied Arab territories.'' The resolution also `` notes the expressed desire and endeavors to place the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory occupied since 1967, including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, under the supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a limited period, as part of the peace process.'' A separate resolution `` acknowledges the proclamation of the State of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'' on Nov. 15. It says that effective Dec. 15, the designation `` Palestine'' will replace `` <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'' in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> system, but the move did not amount to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> recognition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. That resolution passed 104-2, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> again opposed. Thirty-six countries abstained. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <PERSON> Geneva </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON>, in a statement explaining his country's negative votes on the resolutions, said they `` are unhelpful and inconsistent with the search for peace.'' Referring to the call for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON> said the proposal was `` impractical and unrealistic,'' adding, `` we can not support such a concept.'' <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON> reiterated the announcement Wednesday by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had met the three conditions the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> had set for direct U.S.-PLO contacts: explicitly announcing its acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338 -LRB- calling for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from land it occupied in 1967 and recognizing safe and secure borders for all <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> states -RRB-; recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist; and renouncing terrorism. At least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died in a yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

When he did stop, he said, the officers scared him by shooting at his truck and banging on the windows. Meanwhile, Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> rejected defense arguments that authorities acted recklessly during the pursuit. `` Even if the officers made a mistake and endangered the public, I do n't see what that has to do with ... a man who failed to stop for a blue light,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> could receive up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>'s campaign to become national party chairman suffered a blow at the hands of his own governor just as the battle for the top party job widened. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> has been regarded as one of the leading contenders to succeed retiring Democratic national chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s remark Wednesday that he lacks the stature required for the post was widely viewed as damaging his prospects. `` I like <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>. He did a great job here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and is a dear friend,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is obviously a strong feeling that the chairman ought to be a presidential type of candidate, a party spokesman who can be on television responding to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a person of existing national stature.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> later, said he did not intend his remarks as criticism of <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> and regarded him as a good choice `` if we're looking for a nuts-and-bolts guy.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said he was not yet endorsing any of the candidates because as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> he wants to consult with the other governors. The race for the Democratic chairmanship widened as two more candidates, former Reps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, formally announced. A third candidate, former top <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, rounded up the endorsement of former presidential candidate <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> in his attempt to establish broader credentials in the party. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> sought to put the best face on <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s comment, saying it was candid and positive. `` What I have done throughout my professional career is put together campaigns and later a state party that has elected a lot of people,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a longtime party insider, said he hoped to avoid a divisive free-for-all that some are predicting would pit the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wing of the party against Southerners, conservatives and moderates. `` I think there is a myth that this is a blood-bath type of election,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The nearly 400 voting members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will select a new chairman to replace <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> when they meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Feb. 9 and 10. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in a letter to committee members. He said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would not be `` a stalking horse for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' but an effective party builder. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who said he would draw on a base of support among Democrats in the South and West. `` My Southern and Western roots place me at the center of our party's beliefs and ideals,'' he said in a statement. Also a factor, however, is a move by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and others to have a current member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, such as Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, serve as chairman. But that would require a change of the party's charter to permit a part-time chairman, a difficult maneuver needing a two-thirds vote of the committee. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he believed he had more than 100 votes among the committee members so far but acknowledged some were not firm commitments. The race is expected to be expensive, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he is prepared to spend as much as <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> _ perhaps $ 150,000.

<TEXT>
 The government will combat a sharp drop in egg consumption caused by a salmonella poisoning scare by launching an advertising campaign Friday telling consumers they face little risk from cooked eggs. The $ 915,000 campaign in the nation's newspapers, called `` Eggs: The Facts,'' will run through Sunday, said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Demand for eggs in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has dropped 30 percent to 60 percent since Health Minister <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said earlier this month that most of the nation's eggs were tainted with salmonella, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association immediately called for her resignation. The ads say the British eat 200 million eggs a week and that the 49 outbreaks of the salmonella this year have affected only about 1,000 people. In the ads, the government's chief medical officer, Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, advises healthy people there is `` very little risk'' from eating cooked eggs.

 A lawyer for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> today said `` electronic ministry'' itself is on trial after the TV evangelist's first court appearance since his indictment on charges of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contributors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> set unsecured bond of $ 50,000 for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three former aides, and scheduled a court appearance for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> on Jan. 17, when they will enter pleas to fraud and conspiracy charges. The defrocked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader and one-time aides are accused of diverting more than $ 5 million in contributions to the evangelical empire in order to live in luxury. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, did not accompany him today; she was not indicted. `` I am not guilty of these charges and I'm looking forward to due process taking place. If I get a fair trial, we can win this case,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said after court. `` <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is not the only one on trial,'' his attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` His wife is on trial and the whole ministry _ the electronic ministry _ is on trial. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were indicted Dec. 5 after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s finances before <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the evangelical empire in a sex and money scandal. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former top deputy. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former personal aide and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s one-time interior decorator Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> today that no additional charges were expected against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. The Taggarts pleaded innocent today to charges of tax evasion. They are accused of using more than $ 1.1 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for personal expenditures. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> tentatively scheduled their trial for the last week of January. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney, said he does not expect his client to enter a plea until next month. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said previously that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would plead innocent. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 48, resigned in 1987 amid revelations he had a sexual encounter with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her hush money.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials were delighted today with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to begin diplomatic talks with the organization, and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> got its first call from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy chosen to work with them on seeking peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Later today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 138-2 for the convening of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and for temporarily placing the Israeli-occupied territories under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voted against the action. The vote closed out a three-day debate on Palestine which was held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to grant <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to speak at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Palestinians credited their people's uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied lands for gaining their cause worldwide sympathy and leading to the end of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> isolation Electrified by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement, they laughed and embraced in the lobby of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hotel where their delegation was staying as they discussed the long-awaited development with reporters. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision meant `` a historic change in the struggle in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The White House's reversal came after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday that he renounced `` all forms of terrorism'' and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to live in peace and security. Hours later, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had finally met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criteria for negotiations. Indeed, the envoy authorized with initiating contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> made a brief phone call today to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the ambassador, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had no further details. No date has been set for the talks, but a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` We're sure the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will try to have them take place as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today for what the state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said was a working visit, and met with East German Communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. He later left for <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the agency said. ADN quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> `` the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is striving for a comprehensive settlement of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> -RRB- conflict that would guarantee to all those involved a life in dignity, freedom and peace.'' Israeli officials were shocked. They said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s remarks were insufficient because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not rule out violence associated with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and has claimed the lives of 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts `` the right of all parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict to exist in peace and security, and as I have mentioned including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors.'' He also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize the right of all <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations to safe and secure borders. That acceptance was one of three conditions set by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law for dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The others were a clear recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said his country should launch a peace initiative of its own to counter the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s latest diplomatic achievements He proposed letting Palestinians in the occupied lands elect alternative leaders to negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Wednesday night that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does not recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state,'' made by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> last month, but that it would be a subject of discussion. In a speech before the world body on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> had said the world should tell Israelis and Arabs it is tired of their long conflict. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` face up to the need for withdrawal from occupied territories,'' which it seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

<TEXT>
 The state treasurer has asked the federal government to investigate an unexplained $ 200 million loss in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s investment fund for local governments. The loss has sparked a run on the fund by the local governments, which have withdrawn more than $ 100 million in the past three days. Three annual reports show that investments in the consolidated investment fund's `` pool 100'' totaled $ 773.3 million in 1986. That figure dropped to $ 574.1 million a year later, a decrease of $ 199.2 million. No one can say whether the loss represents reduced interest _ money the state thought it would earn but did n't _ or an actual loss in funds invested. The fund was earning a high rate of interest _ up to 13 percent or more _ during the period when the loss occurred, according to two annual reports for the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> and one from the state treasurer's office. State, county and municipal governments put their money into the pool, which the state then invests for them. Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> on Tuesday urged a federal investigation into why the fund, which his office manages, suffered the loss. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said he has passed on to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manchin </ORGANIZATION>'s request that officials determine whether an investigation is warranted. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has not said whether it will investigate. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said he does not believe any criminal wrongdoing is involved, just `` bad investments.'' Other probes, including one by the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are under way. Over the past three days, local governments have withdrawn $ 108.9 million _ including $ 41.3 million Wednesday _ in reaction to reports of the loss. Several key people involved in the $ 200 million loss refuse to discuss it. Associate Treasurer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>, who was in charge of investments, has said he alerted <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> to the problem and is awaiting the results of the Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> probe. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> oversees all state investments but accused <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> of not handling the investments properly. He said staff members of the investments office warned <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> in 1987 that there was a problem, but he said <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> _ who has resigned to become an administrative aide to Gov.-elect <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> _ ignored them. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> has refused to accept <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>'s resignation until the loss is cleared up. Former Assistant Treasurer <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, who actually made the investments for <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>, disappeared after quitting the treasurer's office in late 1987 Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, has declined to comment.

<HEAD>Visa Waiver Program May Boost Japanese Travel To U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese and American tourists and businessmen can travel to each other's countries without a visa beginning Thursday under a pilot program that could boost the flow of free-spending Japanese to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Travel industry spokesmen were unanimous in welcoming the change for, if nothing else, ending the hassle of spending time or money to get a visa. The change will result in a bit more more paperwork for the airlines and a lot less for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Expectations on both sides are that Japanese travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will increase. Spending an average $ 1,000 each aside from airline tickets, 2.2 million Japanese travelers went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, the most from any country. The projection for 1988 is 2.6 million U.S.-bound travelers, said <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Only 430,000 American tourists and businessmen visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1987, making tourism one of the few sectors where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a trade surplus with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ about $ 1 billion last year. <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said it was n't clear how much effect the visa-waiver program would have but that some estimates predicted a 10 percent increase in U.S.-bound travel from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Those of us in tourism promotion have been pushing for it for years,'' <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Freedom to travel is an important part of better international relations.'' He acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, still a magnet for immigration, was more difficult for tourists to enter than some other countries. Americans can enter most European countries without a visa, but Europeans have to obtain visas to travel to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law authorizing negotiations with other countries to waive certain visa requirements. The first agreement, with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, went into effect in July, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the second to embark on a pilot program that will be reassessed in 1991. <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chief of the visa branch at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that the waiver was voluntary and some travelers probably still would want a visa stamped in their passports. The waiver does n't apply to people intending longer stays, such as students, journalists, researchers, exchange visitors or people about to marry and move to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. Travelers without visas will have to convince immigration officers at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry points that they are a bona fide tourist or businessman by producing a return ticket or one for another destination, and there can be no extensions of the 90-day limit or appeals if a traveler is turned back, she said. `` We think the Japanese are the right kind of traveler to take advantage of the visa program,'' she said. `` They take short vacations, often in tour groups, on fixed itineraries.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> expected the new rule would shorten the lines outside the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> embassy, which peaked at 1,665 one day in February, a time when many young Japanese travel after the school year ends and before they start jobs in April. She said about 95 percent of the 930,000 visas issued in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last year were for tourism and business visitors. At the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which sent almost 400,000 people to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, spokesman <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsujino </PERSON> said the change would ease inconvenience and stimulate more travel. `` For example, if a client thinks of going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he can go instantly,'' <PERSON> Tsujino </PERSON> said. `` This is a welcome change.''

<HEAD>Afrikaners To Celebrate 150th Anniversary of Pioneer Trek</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Just before dawn Friday, a few dozen bearded men in leather clothes will take cover behind ox-drawn wagons and fight an imaginary battle against a long-ago defeated Zulu army. The pageant by members of right-wing Afrikaner cultural and political groups will celebrate the Battle of <LOCATION> Blood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the 150th anniversary of the Great Trek that brought the Dutch-descended pioneers out of the British-ruled <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION> into the African wilderness. It wo n't matter that the make-believe battle wo n't be seen by very many people or that it is being staged 20 miles from the government's main celebration at the Pioneer Monument overlooking <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Most of the events and celebrations are symbolic, and in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> there are many ways of interpreting them. Depending on the interpretation, the 1838 departure of the pioneer families was undertaken to avoid <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s abolition of slavery, to set up a free republic in an unpopulated land, to bring Christianity and civilization to African tribes, or to steal the land of blacks and force them into subjugation. Stories about life on the trek, battles, and religious faith have taken on mythical proportions in the folklore of Afrikaners, the descendants of the pioneers who now dominate the government. The 100th anniversary commemoration in 1938 united Afrikaners, gave impetus to their cultural and political organizations and propelled them to power in the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> parliamentary victory 10 years later. The right-wingers regard the gradual and limited reforms of apartheid now being made by today's Nationalist government as a betrayal of white rights. They hope this year's celebration will be a catalyst leading to the ouster of the Nationalists and victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies. A speech by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to crowds of picnickers at the Pioneer Monument will be broadcast live on national television. The celebrations are the culmination of a four-month re-enactment of the Great Trek by wagons and oxen that converged on <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> this week. Twenty miles away in Donkerhoek, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its supporters and right-wing groups such as the Nazi-style Afrikaner Reform Movement will be carrying on a more traditional celebration. The right-wingers will dress in 19th-century clothes, listen to poetry and history readings and hold square-dances and sing-a-longs. The Day of the Vow, Dec. 16, is considered a sacred national holiday. It commemorates the 1838 battle at <LOCATION> Blood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zululand </LOCATION> when one of the pioneer groups vowed to keep the day forever holy if they won the battle against the Zulu King Dingaan the next morning. They did. Most of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority of 26 million, who have no vote in national affairs, do not celebrate the holiday, although they do n't work on the day because the country virtually closes down. A few blacks have participated in the government-sponsored re-enactment as oxen drivers. But the right-wingers have no blacks in their festivities. A coalition of anti-apartheid groups said it would celebrate the day from the view of the losing side in the battle. Blacks, celebrating what they call Heroes Day, will meet in the tribal homeland of KaNgwane to pay homage to the chiefs who fought the whites in the 18th and 19th centuries.

 <PERSON> Levetico </PERSON> <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON>, a 51-year-old grandfather, crawled through the brush with his rifle, training to fight communists because he believes they routinely kill old and unproductive people. <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON> is one of 150,000 volunteers the military hopes to recruit into a new militia it describes as essential to defeat communist rebels. Critics fear a new paramilitary will increase human rights abuses against civilians. Military plans call for the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> to consolidate under one banner hundreds of paramilitary and anti-communist vigilante groups to protect villages against the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. This will help extend government control and curb rights abuses, officials say. In a report today, the London-based group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said legal safeguards are being ignored and that it has documented evidence of torture and illegal detentions by police, soldiers and paramilitary forces. Human rights groups in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and political commentators also question the wisdom of arming thousands more civilians. `` The trend toward militarization makes people think the only way to contend with our problems is through a military solution,'' said one prominent human rights activist, <PERSON> Mariss </PERSON> <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON>. `` We did not expect that the vigilante groups would be dismantled and be replaced by another group.'' But officers training <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON> and more than 80 other volunteers on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, claim the new unit is different. <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON> and the other recruits are lectured on the human rights that are guaranteed by the constitution. Regular and non-commissioned officers will command the new units to ensure they follow regulations, officials said. Like <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON>, most of the volunteers at the makeshift camp in <LOCATION> Liang </LOCATION> were peasant farmers aged 18 to 55. <PERSON> Diwa </PERSON> said in an interview that he joined because he believes that under communism, `` if you are old and unproductive, then they will kill you.'' He said this notion has been reinforced by military officers' lectures on the `` evils of communism.'' At the camp, trainees undergo a five-week crash course including weapons training, basic infantry tactics, self-defense and first aid. After graduating, paramilitary troops move to villages where they live with the people, defend them and gather information on rebels for the army. They get 90 cents a day plus clothing, medical care, housing and firearms. The army `` does not have sufficient manpower to ensure the security of every village,'' Col. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>, constabulary commander for <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION>, said in a recent interview. Regular troops will clear areas of rebels and the paramilitary will follow to maintain government control, he said. The government says rebels virtually control 7,800 of the country's 40,832 villages. `` It just depends on who gets there first,'' said a communist political officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the paramilitary would be most effective in areas that have not been infiltrated. Fears about the new unit stem from the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a paramilitary force that was established by former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and that became notorious for rights abuses. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> after a military-civilian uprising, promised to disband that force during her 1986 election campaign and now says it will be phased out as the new paramilitary unit is deployed. But military officers admit privately that they often turn to paramilitary veterans to find enough recruits for the new unit. <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torno </PERSON>, a trainee in <LOCATION> Pampanga </LOCATION> province, said he has belonged to anti-communist militias since the 1960s, including 17 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` All they did was change the name,'' said an officer who stood nearby.

<HEAD>Quayle Was Bored In House, Feisty In Senate, Book Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was so bored in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> that he missed committee meetings to play golf or work out, earning the nickname of `` wet head'' because he was always coming out of the gym, according to a new book on the vice president-elect. However, the book, by political scientist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenno </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> quickly matured when he moved to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and risked alienating the Republican administration to engineer passage of an important bipartisan job training bill. The freshman Republican senator was so irritated at roadblocks to the bill thrown up by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and then-Secretary <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> that he referred to them as `` the bastards,'' the book says. `` The Making of a Senator: <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'' is a six-year study by <PERSON> Fenno </PERSON> of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s political career and his chief legislative accomplishment, the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982. It is published by Congressional Quarterly. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office said Wednesday there would be no comment on the book. The senator told the author he was `` very bored in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' where he served from 1976 to 1980. He missed meetings and votes and would `` sneak off to play golf'' or work out, one unidentified associate is quoted as saying. `` People called him ` wet head' because he was always coming out of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- gym,'' the associate said. `` It's an awful job _ especially being a Republican there. You ca n't get anything done,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. But when he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, as Republicans captured the majority there, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was able to get a Labor and Human Resources subcommittee chairmanship and drew the task of drafting legislation to replace the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. His work on the bill with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the ranking Democrat on the committee, angered the administration, which wanted to frame its own proposal. Although the Quayle-Kennedy bill eventually prevailed, tension between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was such that the senator told the author: `` They ought to be hung _ the bastards.'' Contrary to custom, no members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were invited to the bill-signing ceremony. And when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> later asked to have his picture taken with the president and to have his wife and children accompany him, he was told that the senator could come to the White House unannounced, through the side gate and with no family members.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he would not hesitate to `` break off communications'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> if it reneged on its declarations to renounce terrorism and accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defended his decision to permit a dialogue between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, reversing a 12-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy, telling reporters that `` words have been spoken'' that spelled out the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s acceptance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for direct talks. The president also said that he did n't think <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had any reason to be upset by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision because `` we have made it very plain that we have not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the safety'' of the Jewish state. The president talked to reporters twice, during picture-taking sessions in the Oval Office with Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and later with <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>. He spoke after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials quickly followed through on the reversal of the longstanding policy against talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, seeking an early meeting. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said he hoped that would lead to direct Arab-Israeli peace talks. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he supported the president's decision. He added: `` I have n't spelled out any hopes about it. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met the conditions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we will go forward with a dialogue, not negotiations, but a dialogue. ... Let's see how things evolve.'' As for the discussions, he said, `` There's no game plan; there's no five-point program. Asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his administration starts next month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I am vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I become president on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the administration made its move after it became satisfied that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in a news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Wednesday, had complied with the American conditions for a dialogue with his organization. Asked today to explain the policy reversal, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` Well, because the words have been spoken, and the words were the words that we have been stating were necessary.'' But he quickly added that `` of course, ... the words must be matched by performance, and if they're not, why, we're back where we started.'' Asked a short time later what he would do if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> failed to live up to its statements, the president replied, `` Well, we'd certainly break off communications.'' Asked if such direct U.S.-PLO contacts could achieve anything in view of opposition by the Israeli government, he said `` the ultimate solution does not depend on outsiders or us. Peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting with each other and settling their differences.'' Asked why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Well, because there is no such thing as of now. There is n't a Palestinian state. And if you recognize someone ... as that, it would be us declaring who was in charge there.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the move was `` just another step in what we've been trying for eight years _ to bring about peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was assigned to open the historic `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, called the director general of the political section at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said While no date was set, `` we're sure the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will try hard to have them take place as soon as possible, `` said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` But right now, the time, the place and the level have not been set,'' he said. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the session could be held as early as tomorrow, and certainly within the next few days. He said <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> was the logical site and he doubted that a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official would participate at this stage. So far as the topics, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` we have our agenda of things to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> about. First among them is the issue of terrorism. And how you get to peace negotiations.'' On Capitol Hill: _ Sen <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move as a `` significant step toward advancing the peace process.'' The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senator said that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncement of terrorism were `` important statements'' but that `` in light of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s record ... must be viewed with caution.'' _ The current majority leader, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-W </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, praised the decision to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling the organization's new position `` an opportunity that must be pushed forward despite `` Our commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is firm and unswerving,'' he said in a written statement. `` But it must be tempered by the realization that there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward peace.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., sought to reassure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying that continued aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the top recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance, is necessary both to calm <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fears and `` as a clear signal to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and other parties that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed firmly to the independence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within secure borders The announcement Wednesday night left <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in diplomatic isolation and came just a few hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken a tough line against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, declaring that it had not met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for direct dealings. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in statements made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> about the same time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking, had met the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a `` substantive dialogue'' _ a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the Palestinian group. Only a day earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> failed to meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions. And less than three weeks ago, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of terrorism and said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` an accessory to such terrorism.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, asked Wednesday if he had changed his mind on that subject, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had issued a statement Wednesday that `` was clear; it was not encumbered.'' He said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group had accepted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist in peace and security, and renounced terrorism. `` As a result,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared for a substantive dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just a few hours earlier had demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands. `` I want a clear statement on renunciation of terror,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I want a very clear, unambiguous statement on the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist as a state, and I want a clear endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution 242.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, adopted in 1967 and 1973, affirm the right of all states in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to live in peace. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not specifically mentioned.

 <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s fraud conspiracy trial went to the jury today for a verdict on whether he schemed to cheat tax collectors and lenders who supported his controversial causes. After final closing arguments by defense lawyers and a rebuttal by government prosecutors, Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sent the case to the jury of eight women and four men who heard testimony during the 15-day trial. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the jurors will deliberate Saturday if necessary to reach a verdict. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, the 66-year-old political maverick and perennial minor-party presidential candidate, did not testify in his own defense. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> fund-raisers solicited loans with good faith assurances that they would be repaid, but Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said all the defendants knew the terms of the loans could not be honored. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told the jurors in the government's rebuttal that supporters who loaned money to the LaRouche movement `` were n't the lifeblood of this organization, these supporters were bled dry.'' `` The organization treated these people with cynicism and disregard'' because everyone knew that the LaRouche organization was `` a bankruptcy waiting to happen,'' he said. The result, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, was `` an enormous crime _ a $ 30 million crime.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> cautioned the jurors in his instructions that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political goals were irrelevant to the case, and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> insisted that the government was not trying to `` get at <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> or quiet a political movement. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political movement embraces a number of unorthodox positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain world events. It has alleged that figures such as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> participate in those conspiracies. <PERSON> Larouche </PERSON> backers also have advocated a quarantine for AIDS victims. A half-dozen defense attorneys heaped abuse on the government's case against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates as `` garbage'' and a `` rotting carcass'' during closing arguments Tuesday But prosecutors said they had proved that the defendants had conspired to defraud LaRouche supporters by raising more than $ 30 million in loans without any intention of repaying them. In addition, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he controls and pretending he had no taxable income. If convicted on all 13 counts against him, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his aides deny any wrongdoing. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said the government's case had nothing to do with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political beliefs but focused on allegedly deceptive fund-raising practices. `` The ends, however noble they may be ... do not justify lying to people to get their money,'' <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> declared. He said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s lenders were `` burned by a group of people who think they are better, and can use the money better, than anyone else.'' But <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said the government's case was based on `` voodoo conspiracy'' charges that were vague and unfounded. `` They do n't want you to decide straightforward facts,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told the jurors. `` They want you to decide garbage.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the `` bad smell'' that sometimes wafted through the courtroom `` came from the rotting carcass of the government's case.'' At one point, the judge admonished defense lawyer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gettings </PERSON> for shouting at the jury during an especially impassioned closing argument. Hunched over, his arms flailing and his fingers waggling, <PERSON> Gettings </PERSON> branded as `` liars'' two crucial government witnesses _ both former employees of the LaRouche organization _ who he said were `` openly, vehemently hostile to every defendant in this case.'' <PERSON> Gettings </PERSON> said the defendants had simply borrowed too much money and were unable to repay loans because of government harassment and media attacks that shrank their revenues. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his fund-raisers were n't trying to line their pockets like classic fraud defendants, <PERSON> Gettings </PERSON> said. `` If you do n't find greed, it's impossible to find fraud,'' he said Defense lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> case was n't about money but `` about a political movement with dedicated followers who want it to succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> claimed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> actually wrote the letter that an elderly <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman sent to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> demanding the return of her loan money. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the letter was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` entrapment'' attempt against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he supports President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to begin talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but he cautioned, `` Let's see how things evolve ... there's no game plan.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had made `` some movement'' in a speech Tuesday but not enough to warrant direct dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Later, however, after administration officials went over new <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> comments on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would enter into `` a substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The conditions that the American government set out have been consistent, steadfast and now Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says that those conditions are met,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today. `` So we will observe, we will watch and our ambassador in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> will begin a dialogue. There's no game plan, there's no five-point program.'' Asked if he preferred that the talks wait until he takes office next month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I am vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I become president on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21 I'll tell you what I want to do.'' `` I support the president's decision. Let's see how things evolve. My position remains the same. I want to see direct talks between, for example, between King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Israelis,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took another step in forming his new administration, naming his choice for agriculture secretary. He also said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> could be an outstanding secretary of defense and he doubted that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check had turned up anything to disqualify the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has not yet decided who will run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, although sources said Tower remained the leading candidate. With eight more appointments to go, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to complete naming his Cabinet before Christmas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on Wednesday as the sixth member of his Cabinet. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, will be secretary of agriculture. After three years in government, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had wanted to return to private business. Standing alongside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a news conference, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said there were `` only a few people in the world who could convince me to carry forward in another stint in government, but you're one of those few.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would name a black to his Cabinet. He has been urged by some black supporters to name <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a black who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that another black, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a retired three-star Army general who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is the top contender to head the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and that a Hispanic member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, is a candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Also, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who lost his re-election bid last month, confirmed that the senator has met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about possibly taking over the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Covering a wide range of topics at the news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Hinted his administration will seek a delay in February's resumption of arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> `` There is no way that we are going to have by Feb. 15 or 16 a detailed point-by-point program on arms talks,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. _ Said Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s role would be `` very much like the Reagan-Bush relationship. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be a `` key player'' in national security affairs if he wants to be and that there may be specific assignments in other areas. _ Said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm programs but did n't say what he meant by substantial `` I do not believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of farmers,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, a onetime <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmer, was the fifth veteran of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to join <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. Asked how <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s selection squared with his promise to bring a new team of people to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well, his face is familiar, but the job is very different than being trade representative.'' He promised anew to bring in some unfamiliar faces. However, Tower is a familiar figure, a onetime senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who was an arms negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Even before the end of the presidential campaign, Tower was at the top of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list to run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, but his appointment has been delayed by an extensive background check of his dealings with defense contractors and aspects of his personal life.

 The national peanut marketing quota for 1989 will be 1.44 million tons, up 37,800 tons from last year's quota, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Officials said the quota for 1989 was unchanged from the level proposed last month. By law, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is required to announce a final decision on the proposed quota by Dec. 15. The national quota is required by law to be equal to the estimated quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible, seed and related uses in the 1989-90 marketing year, which will begin Aug. 1, 1989. The quota can not be less than 1.1 million tons. Officials said the 1989 poundage quota will be allocated to each producing state based on the state's share of the 1988 quota. Increases in a state's quota will be allocated among qualifying peanut farms. Peanut farmers voted in a referendum in January 1986 to continue the quota for crops through 1990.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Against French-Only Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled against a <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> law forbidding languages other than French on commercial signs. The court's unanimous 5-0 ruling allows <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> to order French on signs but can not prevent other languages from being used as well. Quebec's premier, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, is expected to announce his decision Sunday on how the provincial government will comply with the ruling. The language law was passed in 1977 when the separatist Parti Quebecois held power. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform has supported multilingual signs. The court found that the law requiring commercial signs only in French violated the guarantees of freedom of expression provided in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> charter. Constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning that <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> should be able to find some kind of compromise on the issue. `` The judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties,'' lawyer <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> said in a live interview with the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A majority of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> residents speak French as a first language Two separate cases by English-speaking residents challenged the law.

 A black alderman dropped out of the race for mayor Thursday, warning of a return to `` machine politics'' unless blacks can agree upon a candidate to oppose the son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. In announcing his withdrawal, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the legendary political boss, would `` without a doubt'' win the April 4 mayor's race unless either <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> or Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, both of whom are black, drop out of the race <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> gave his support to <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who was the leading black candidate in a recent newspaper poll. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is considered the front-runner, based on recent polls. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> square off in a Feb. 28 Democratic primary. A <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> administration, according to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, would be a `` reinstitution of what we call plantation politics in many areas of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Feudal system politics ... where clout becomes the passport to city services, clout becomes the passport to jobs, clout becomes the passport to benefits.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s campaign manager, called <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' comments `` unfortunate,'' and said, `` they're talking about the past. Our campaign is focused on the future.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, elected mayor by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after the death last November of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, has raised more than $ 2 million for his campaign. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he never considered endorsing <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. `` The Evans support comes from the progressive, the activist base group of the coalition that generated and sustained the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> era,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` So I would have a much greater feeling that machine influence would not play nearly as much of a role in an <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> administration as it would in a <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> administration.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll taken Dec. 2-5 of 1,038 registered voters indicated that of 12 declared or potential candidates, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was the choice of 29 percent. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> had 17 percent, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> had 10 percent and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is not a candidate, had 10 percent. In that poll, which had an error range of 3 percentage points, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> received 3 percent of the votes. Winning the Democratic primary generally has been tantamount to winning the general election in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s recent history. That changed somewhat in 1983 when Republican <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Epton </PERSON> made a strong showing in a losing effort against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Police found the naked body of a 4-year-old girl in a campground near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, the first confirmed death in a series of crimes against children that have traumatized the city's suburbs A 7-year-old girl and another 4-year-old remain missing in <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> prefecture west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in a series of disappearances that began in August. Six times since October, children at play have been stabbed by strangers in <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> prefecture, east of the capital. None of the stabbing victims, ranging in age from 2 to 4, was fatally injured. Police said they are treating the incidents as cases of sexual perversion. The stabbings and abductions of toddlers by unidentified stalkers have caused panic in the normally placid suburbs. In a country that prides itself on a low crime rate, the crimes also have attracted the nation's attention. `` I never thought a thing like this could happen here,'' a housewife told the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the night before <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>'s naked body was found in a campground 20 miles from her home. `` We moved here because we thought this would be a good place to raise children.'' Police searched the campground after officials there reported finding articles of clothing with <PERSON> Erika </PERSON>'s name on them. In the middle-class developments where the missing girls lived, hundreds of office workers and high school students have joined police in fruitless searches of playgrounds and nearby scrubland. Housewives have posted fliers bearing likenesses of the girls, all of whom disappeared in the bustling neighborhoods in the afternoon hours after school let out and before darkness fell. Police helicopters and patrol cars have broadcast warnings urging children to get home before dark, and school principals have admonished pupils to avoid strangers and see each other home. But despite a combined turnout of almost 6,000 police officers in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> and a similar number in <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION>, police report no arrests and few leads. On Wednesday, they released a drawing _ based on another child's description _ of a man seen with <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> shortly before she disappeared It showed a face covered by sunglasses and a gauze mask. `` Little children do n't have large vocabularies,'' said <PERSON> Koji </PERSON> <PERSON> Tateishi </PERSON>, an assistant inspector with the <ORGANIZATION> Chiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. In the stabbings, `` what happens to them happens in a flash. They ca n't really tell us about it.'' `` We're treating these as cases of sexual perversion,'' he said. Since <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> was reported missing on Friday and 3-year-old <PERSON> Sachiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> was stabbed in the stomach on a quiet street in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> a day later, coverage on nightly news programs and in nationwide newspapers has intensified to a level unseen since the kidnap-murder of a small boy in September 1987. The country followed nightly news reports on the ordeal of 5-year-old <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogiwara </PERSON>. The reports described his abduction near his home, anonymous calls demanding a 20 million yen ransom -LRB- then $ 140,000 -RRB- from his fireman father, and the discovery of the boy's body in a ravine two days later. Outraged media commentators then spoke of the unraveling of Japanese society and waning confidence in a formidable police force that boasted a 1987 record of arrests in 62.6 percent of all reported non-traffic crimes, compared with 20.7 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Despite a perceived increase in crimes against children, overall crime in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> actually declined 0.2 percent in 1987. But in the <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> section where <PERSON> Sachiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> was stabbed, fear has curtailed late-afternoon activity at the neighborhood park, housewife <PERSON> Chisato </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiba </PERSON> said. She continues to take her 15-month-old son outside to play, but `` even more than before, I make it a point to watch him very closely,'' she said. `` The thing is, there's really no way to prevent these things.''

 A man convicted of murdering his wife 33 years ago will not get a pardon hearing even though another man confessed to the slaying before his death last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spire </PERSON>, one of three members of the board, said <PERSON> Darrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> can explore other avenues, but he declined to elaborate. The ruling was unanimous. Spire said the board can consider <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s request for a pardon only if there is a `` clear miscarriage of justice.'' The board, Spire said, `` is not a court, not a super appeals board.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 57, former parks supervisor in <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, served 13 years in prison for the 1955 murder of his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. An appeals court overturned his conviction on the ground that police had coerced a confession, but prosecutors did not retry him, and he was paroled in 1969. Another convicted murderer, <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Peery </PERSON>, had meanwhile told his lawyers that he killed Mrs. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, giving them intimate details of the killing, but made them promise not to reveal his confession until after his death. The lawyers, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, came forward after <PERSON> Peery </PERSON>, 63, died of a heart attack on death row in July. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruckner </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> told him all he wanted `` is a piece of paper _ a complete pardon finally clearing my name.'' <PERSON> Bruckner </PERSON> did not attend today's board hearing and had no immediate comment on the ruling. Secretary of State <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Beermann </PERSON>, another member of the pardon board, said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> could seek a new trial. The pardon board, which also includes Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, was given a sealed transcript of <PERSON> Peery </PERSON>'s admission and considered <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s request for a pardon hearing a day after the 33rd anniversary of Mrs. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Peery </PERSON>'s confession was among two years of taped and written interviews he gave to <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> in the hope a book would be written about his exploits. He boasted of killing 12 people over four decades.

 Hurricane-force winds wreaked havoc across northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, overturning trucks, toppling trees onto homes, tearing boats from their moorings and cutting power to more than 300,000 customers.

<HEAD>Random Drug Tests Of Secrets Handlers Argued</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government does not need evidence of drug abuse to justify random tests of federal officials with access to classified information, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told an appeals court Thursday. Deterrence of drug use among officials in a position to compromise secrets is justification enough to randomly test them, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is permitted as an employer to make reasonable steps to prevent something from becoming a problem,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said, challenging a lower court's ban on random testing of 4,700 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` There are enormous national security interests at stake here,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> told a three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The lower court's ruling stopped the drug-testing program from being implemented last summer. `` This is a case about protecting the integrity of those who represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in court,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. `` It's a case about protecting national security, safeguarding grand jury secrecy and preserving the efficacy of criminal prosecution.'' `` The context is a fitness-for-duty test by a public employer,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said of the program that is being challenged by employees who obtained a permanent injunction barring the tests from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON>. Former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> attorney general <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> urged the panel to uphold <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON>'s finding that testing without any suspicion of drug use by the individual is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said the appeals court was `` mandated to weigh and to balance'' the government's interest in testing with the individual employee's constitutional rights to privacy. In doing so, the court must ask: `` Is there a demonstrable existence of a problem?'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has failed to provide `` some kind of data that supports the reasonableness'' of the search, and `` That is the core command of the Fourth Amendment,'' said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, who was once <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The employees do n't dispute the need to preserve the department's integrity or protect secrets, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said `` The question is ` how may the department go about enforcing and imposing those accepted requirements?''' `` The department has plenty of ways _ observation of supervisors, background checks, all the less intrusive ways _ to check up on its employees,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> argued that the issue was not evidence of drug use but the types of secrets the employees handled. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees have access to some of the nation's most closely held secrets, such as information about counter-intelligence and defense programs, such as the stealth bomber `` Stealth technology is something that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> would crawl over hot coals to get its hands on,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. But his argument seemed to trouble Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, who questioned when those national security concerns would justify an intrusive search. `` The strongest part of your case is the government's interest,'' <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>. `` It's the other side of the equation, what can trigger this type of testing that bothers me the most.'' There's `` no question we are living in a high-risk society. The question is how far can we go in deterring large risks ... in terms of our constitutional rights,'' <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees already waived privacy rights when they submitted to extensive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks and medical examinations. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, taking up an argument advanced by <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, suggested that requiring evidence of drug use would mean the government would have to stop testing once it had successfully deterred narcotics abuse among a group of employees. `` The implications of that argument are awful,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said. The government `` could suspend the Constitution'' if deterrence were allowed to be the sole justification for drug testing, he said. Both sides urged the court to decide the case without waiting for a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on two other cases involving drug testing. The high court is reviewing testing of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents seeking promotion and railway crews involved in accidents. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> also sat on the panel, which gave no indication when it would rule.

<TEXT>
 The judge in <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s murder trial will probably tell the jury that his live-in lover was an accomplice in the death of the girl they raised, a move that could undermine her testimony, according to a source. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony is central to the case against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is accused in the 1987 fatal beating of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The source, who is involved in the case and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> probably will tell the jury to consider Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> an accomplice. Depending on how the judge phrases the instruction, it could mean the jury will not be permitted to use her testimony to convict <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> unless there is corroborating evidence. Today's session was delayed, however, when <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> was hit by a car and suffered two broken wrists as he rode his bike to court, police said. If <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> tells the six men and six women to consider her an accomplice `` as a matter of fact,'' he lets them decide whether her actions or inaction contributed to the child's death. If the jurors decide she contributed to the death, then her testimony must be supported by other evidence. If the judge instructs them that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was an accomplice as a `` matter of law,'' then the panel has no choice and is obliged to use Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony only if it is supported by other evidence or testimony. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is a disbarred lawyer charged in the death of the girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager. The girl was removed from his <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment and died in a hospital three days later of a head injury. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has denied hitting the girl, but Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her the night <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was fatally injured that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> then went to dinner with a friend. She said that during the three hours that he was out, she did nothing to help the child. Medical experts testified that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> could probably have been saved if help had been summoned earlier. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> originally was charged with murder. Prosecutors dropped charges on the ground that she had been so beaten down physically and mentally by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> that she was unable to act. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> agreed to testify against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former editor of children's books, spent seven days on the witness stand recalling 12 brutal and bizarre years with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>.

 The American decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest step toward <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace in a decade, but radical Palestinians called <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a traitor Thursday and said the bloodshed will continue. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, coupled with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response after years of shunning the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is the most dramatic development since <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979 His move could be the turning point in the 40 years of <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, but it also is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's greatest gamble and could explode in his face. Such radical Palestinian factions as the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group may launch a new wave of terrorism intended to wreck the initiative. Militants within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have stayed their hands for the moment, but many feel <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made too many concessions. The <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist group that reconciled with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last year after a four-year estrangement, accused him of `` capitulation.'' Its leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, said in a statement sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, that it welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision but felt <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> acted only to `` end the diplomatic isolation that followed its refusal to grant Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' `` Therefore, we urge our masses to keep up the struggle to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to recognize the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and all legitimate Palestinin rights,'' he said. After the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the assembly moved its session to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, who leads a Syrian-based breakaway faction called Fatah-Uprising, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` a traitor ... for his surrenderist concessions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> enemy.'' A Mousa spokesman accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman later of paying `` an exhorbitant price, the recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, for this American decision'' and declared: `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is not able to fulfill his commitments, especially his commitment to give up the armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> and other dissidents left the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 in a Syrian-supported mutiny. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, also backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has recognized -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- and offered four-fifths of the Palestinian land to'' the Jewish state. `` By renouncing violence and terrorism, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is condemning anyone who uses the gun against the Israeli occupier,'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has offered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> what he does n't have. The land of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> is not the property of any organization or any individual.'' Six weeks ago, West German authorities arrested 13 people suspected of belonging to <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group who said they were planning terrorist attacks. The extremist <PERSON> Saiqa </PERSON> faction, whose name in Arabic means `` lightning,'' said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>: `` We shall see to it that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> gets back on its original revolutionary course of struggle.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his lieutenants would be targets of the radicals, along with Israelis and Americans. Since his first hints at moderation 15 years ago, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has had to fight not only the Israelis but Palestinian extremists and hard-line <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations led by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, has sought for years to gain control of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Gunmen working for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> have killed a score of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aides, and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service has assassinated others. The last victim of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's right-hand man, shot to death April 16 at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security sources. Last month, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> steered the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature to implicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also declared an independent state, presumably to be located in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Palestinians have been in revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation for a year. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s guerrilla group and others went along with the compromise at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting for the sake of unity, but <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>: `` We're backing your efforts because this is what the majority wants, but we do n't believe moderation will pay.

 The City Council has unanimously approved an ordinance banning beepers in all public and private schools, a move educators hope will put a dent in drug sales and prostitution. `` We know their mothers are not beeping them,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said earlier at a committee meeting.

<HEAD>Waiting Period on New Sales Starts Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A city ordinance requiring handgun purchasers to wait 15 days before picking up their weapons goes into effect Friday. The law requires the wait between sale and receipt of a handgun to allow police time to check whether the prospective buyer has a criminal record or is mentally incompetent. Until now, guns could be picked up immediately and police had to track the buyers down if there were reasons to prevent them from buying guns. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s ordinance is based on an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law that allows cities to enact local gun control measures. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which lobbied against the ordinance, said <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s law goes farther than measures in other cities because it applies to individuals who sell guns, as well as to commercial gun dealers. The law requires anyone selling, renting, leasing or transferring ownership or possession of a handgun to notify police of the transaction and fill out an application form. Forms are available at police district stations and the city <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices. The ordinance does not cover rifles or shotguns. Violation is a first-degree misdemeanor with a maximum $ 1,000 fine and six months in jail. Three stores in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> now sell handguns. Retailers say it is too soon to tell what impact the ordinance will have on sales.

The program offered by the Foundation for Excellence in Teaching is being financed by <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GATX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a number of individuals. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Koldyke </PERSON>, who helped start the foundation, said the program is an investment in the city's youth. `` In the venture capital business, you have to project for the future ... and this is the future,'' said <PERSON> Koldyke </PERSON>, general partner of <ORGANIZATION> Frontenac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a venture capital firm. The program and others like it have the support of the 680,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which has lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a similar federal program, said spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Treibitz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Having goverment do it is really the norm. I think what is a little out of the ordinary is having the corporation underwrite this and I think you will see more and more of that down the line,'' <PERSON> Treibitz </PERSON> said. He added corporations `` are begining to realize that they have a lot at stake and they need to improve the schools.'' <PERSON> Koldyke </PERSON> said 30 teachers who were winners of the foundation's <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> awards evaluated the files of 190 promising seniors nominated by the city's public and private high schools The 15 winners can attend one of four schools: <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, 17, said he jumped at the chance for a scholarship. `` I want to be a music educator _ teach high school students to sing classical music and some gospel,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` I think I might have afforded college without this, but I would have been in debt for a long time.'' For <PERSON> Koldyke </PERSON>, who taught for a year in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1965, supplying gifted teachers to the city schools has an element of personal satisfaction. `` I was n't a very good teacher,'' he said, `` and I came to realize that it was an extremely tough profession.''

 Following a 76-year-old holiday tradition, about 2,000 Alaskans lined up in the slush to get a rare look inside the governor's mansion, shake the chief executive's hand and sip warm cider. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, played host at the Christmas open house Wednesday night for the third consecutive year in the colonial mansion overlooking the state capital. Except for two years during World War II, the open house has been an annual event since the imposing, three-story home was built for territorial Gov. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in 1912. `` I've been to about 38 of them out of the 40 years I've been here,'' said 92-year-old <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. `` This is my house and I love it.'' The feeling that the house is a state treasure that belongs to all Alaskans brings them out in every shape, age and occupation. `` You would n't be able to get away with it in a place with more population,'' said <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosworth </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>'s 30,000 residents. `` It's nice. It gives people a feeling they're part of it.'' Guests mingled about the main floor of the 15-room mansion carrying plates of food and cups of cider or punch, while the Cowpers and Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlpine </PERSON> and his wife greeted people. The upstairs living quarters and the basement were off limits. In the living room, guests were entertained by violinists and a chorus, while children lined up to talk to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiscus </PERSON>, who was sampling the refreshments with her 12-year-old daughter <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, said they attend the open house every year. The governor's chef, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON>, and the mansion staff begin planning for the three-hour affair in July. Baking begins in September and most of the cookies, breads and hors d'oeuvres are stored in the freezer. This year the treats included 1,500 egg rolls, 1,400 artichoke pastries, 1,350 sausage pastries, 1,400 deviled eggs and 20 pounds of Brie cheese stuffed with apples and pears. By the end, only a few treats remained. For many, the open house has become a family tradition. Some parents brought video cameras, while others took snapshots. The largest attendance at the open house came in 1983, when an estimated 4,000 people filed through the mansion. Interest was sparked that year by controversy over a $ 2.7 million mansion restoration and redecoration project during the term of former Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheffield </PERSON>. The state foots the bill for the open house, with expenses coming out of the mansion budget, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramseur </PERSON> said.

 A mail handler shot three co-workers in the main <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> post office, then holed up inside for 13 hours with his girlfriend as a hostage, firing birdshot at random from under a door today, authorities said. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> threw out his shotgun and surrendered this morning after all-night telephone negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police, including a cousin who is a police officer. His girlfriend appeared unhurt, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. The rampage was prompted by <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s concern for the welfare of his two children in his wife's custody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Police Superintendent <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON>, who got him to surrender. `` I just tried to appeal to him as a father,'' <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said. None of the three co-workers hit by birdshot from <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s gun suffered life-threatening wounds, hospital officials said. One person was shot in the eye. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who is about 40, was a six-year mail handler who had recently been promoted but whose wife had left him, post office spokesman <PERSON> Cesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> said. `` He feels like he does n't like the conditions which they -LRB- his children -RRB- are living under, and I assured him that I would look into that,'' <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said. `` And if his kids are being neglected, I would do all I could to try to get some intervention to maybe get the kids back here in the custody of their grandmother.'' <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was n't angry at his girlfriend and co-worker, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 29. `` After the shooting started he just grabbed her,'' the police superintendent said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> made only one demand during the siege, telling negotiators he did n't want to see any reporters. Police moved all reporters and photographers off the sidewalk to a parking garage across the street. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> came to work Wednesday night and `` got into some sort of argument with a co-worker, and pulled a weapon out of a bag he had secured in the area,'' said <PERSON> Volney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in an adjacent building. The 8:30 p.m. shootings chased about 400 workers from the building, which takes up most of a city block across the street from the Superdome. About 100 workers took cover and hid in the building for four hours before being escorted out by officers making a room-by-room search for the gunman. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> chased off <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents with gunfire when they cornered him in a room used for coffee breaks, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. During the night, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> apparently became frustrated and fired about 10 more shots, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. No one was hurt. `` They were just random shots,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` They have n't been at anyone ... just stick the barrel under the door and fire.'' Gunfire hit the telephone officers and relatives had used to try to talk <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> into surrendering. Another phone was tossed to him. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s shotgun had been brought in earlier, but he gave no further details except to say two shots were fired and one of the wounded was the person <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> argued with. He did not identify the victims. Two people, one hit in a thigh and the other in an arm, were in stable condition at area hospitals, officials said. A third person was wounded in the eye and underwent surgery at Charity Hospital. When the shooting began, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was standing in line with his Christmas cards. `` I was going to mail this box of stuff I have and the security guard came down, he was real excited,'' <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> said. `` The guard was screaming, ` There's a guy with a gun!''' <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> said the security guard ran to the door to make sure the half dozen or so postal workers and customers escaped. `` I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' he said. `` Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> post office was the scene of another shooting, in 1980 when postal worker <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> burst in and killed his 35-year-old supervisor with a .30 - caliber On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time mailman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> walked into the post office in <LOCATION> Edmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, with guns and ammunition in his mail bag and began shooting. He killed 14 postal workers and wounded six others before killing himself.

<HEAD>PLO United On Moderate Strategy, But It's Fragile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, once a ragtag army of militants pursuing the quixotic aim of crushing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has evolved into a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> government-in-waiting embracing a wide range of ideologies. But the unity is fragile. The nine guerrilla factions and other political groups which constitute the 23-year-old movement are held together by their Palestinian nationalism. They are prey to the divisive and violent currents of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> politics. They range from the Marxist guerrillas of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, which endorsed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s strategy of moderation with some reluctance, to Islamic fundamentalists The outcome of the talks will be crucial for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s strategy of moderation. That depends to a large degree on him holding the radical elements of his disparate organization in check long enough to attain solid political gains _ not just from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> represents a widely divergent constituency in the 5.5 million strong Palestinian diaspora, from poor peasants eking a living on the scrubland of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to intellectuals in Western capitals. Some, like <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, are Greek Orthodox Christians. Most, like <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, are Moslems. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is more than just a military organization dedicated to regaining the Palestinian homeland lost in 1948. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, 59, has built it into an institution that provides social, educational and medical services that are more effective than those run by some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments. <PERSON> Naseer </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachussetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, noted recently that this infrastructure `` was the real target'' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which was aimed at crushing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla factions retain considerable autonomy and are often backed by different Arab countries, such as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, who have frequently sought to manipulate the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> became chairman 19 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has often been wracked by schisms. To hold the movement together, he has had to constantly compromise, often when a decisive move could have meant a breakthrough in his efforts to make political gains. His success in steering the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile and its highest decision-making body, to endorse recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounce terrorism was largely due the year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> The uprising gave the Palestinian struggle a crucial political dimension. The revolt arose from frustration at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to achieve political advances and was the catalyst that helped swing things <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s way. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not announced who will talk with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. But the Palestinian negotiators will be the pointmen for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>; <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, 62, a charismatic physician; and <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, 57, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. These three often meet behind closed doors before convening the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling 15-man executive committee to formulate policy. Another key figure will be <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political department and its de facto `` foreign minister'' since 1973 <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, and his younger brother <PERSON> Hani </PERSON>, have been close <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> advisers for years. Both are members of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, the largest group in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and often act as his emissaries to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> is another important figure who will be closely involved behind the scenes with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team led by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>.

 Foreign relief workers said Thursday they were giving up hope of finding more survivors of the Armenian earthquake, and crews prepared to evacuate the last residents of this hard-hit town and raze it. <PERSON> Nouradian </PERSON> <PERSON> Norig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kritkorianizh </PERSON>, the first secretary of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that crews would take measures to prevent infectious diseases and begin razing the city on Sunday About 15,000 of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>'s 25,000 people died in the Dec. 7 quake that destroyed most of city, he said. Altogether, the quake killed 55,000 people in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and left 500,000 of the area's 700,000 people homeless. Foreign relief experts and Soviet officials said hope was fading to find more survivors, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said searchers had found only one person alive in the past 24 hours. That person was found in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, it said. Voices and other signs of life in the ruins of destroyed cities dropped off sharply after Monday night, when temperatures plummeted to below freezing, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Disaster Assistance office said at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference. `` The hope of finding any more -LRB- survivors -RRB- is ended,'' she said. Green military vans with mounted speakers toured the muddy streets asking people to leave. Most women and children already were gone. `` We believe the evacuation will take about three days,'' <PERSON> Kritkorianizh </PERSON> said. About 5,000 men needed to begin rebuilding the city in early spring will be given temporary housing about one mile from <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, he said. Trucks were distributing milk, bread, sausages, meat and oranges to the survivors in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, where it remained cold and damp. Some people had set up what was left of their household belongings _ upholstered chairs, mattresses and even an occassional brass bed _ around crackling bonfires where it was warmer than inside tents. A large group of people were pressing against the gates of what was once the city's central market, where soldiers were distributing warm coats. Soviet officials vowed to continue the search until there is no more hope of bringing people out alive but said no more doctors or fire brigades are needed. `` Yesterday -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgenvy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> said the search was to continue but that with the lapse of time hopes grow smaller and smaller. They are still looking for people in the ruins,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said at a news briefing. Teams from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have already returned home. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON>, head of the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said he doubted anybody was still alive. `` If I thought there was someone still alive I would not be sitting here,'' <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> said his group was physically exhausted and that the Soviets were beginning to employ bulldozers, making it difficult for them to use their high technology equipment to find victims. Rows of bulldozers were seen parked a few blocks from the main square in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city located to the west of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviets had decided to call off the search and rescue on Dec. 20 and that some of the foreign relief teams were leaving. `` It is a terrible dilemna for authorities caught between the need for proper sanitation and the need to respect relatives who are still hanging on,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said that 25,000 bodies had been counted based on figures provided to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> by the Soviet Council of Ministers. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that 21,755 bodies had been identified and counted so far. Thousands of corpses remained buried in rubble. `` There is a danger of typhoid, cholera, and dysentery from the poor sanitation in the disaster area which has likely led to contamination of the water supply by insects and rodents,'' Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Netherlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Reporters visitng <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> on Thursday saw hundreds of sacks of lime piled at a hospital, apparently in preparation for spreading on corpses. While the relief teams were pulling out, looters were moving in. Police have detained 179 people accused of stealing foreign relief packages and looting in the last 24 hours, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Monstrous as it sounds, there are also others _ better described as shadows rather than as human beings.. They roam around the ruins _ not looking anybody in the face, they roam around the ruins _ not to save but to steal,'' <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s Deputy Interior Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution Thursday, with only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposed, calling for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of Israeli-occupied Arab lands. It acted at the end of a three-day debate on Palestinian questions, which was moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa. The vote was 138-2 with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> abstaining and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> not participating. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> voted yes with reservations, declaring they did not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which was mentioned in the resolution. An international conference should be convened under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices `` with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on an equal footing,'' the resolution said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> should establish a preparatory committee. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> had said in the debate Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would oppose such a resolution. `` An international conference may be useful insofar as it helps to launch and support direct negotiations, but a conference must not preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. The resolution `` affirms'' that one principle for achieving peace is `` the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory occupied since 1967, including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and the other occupied Arab territories.'' It `` notes the expressed desire and endeavors to place the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory occupied since 1967, including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, under the supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a limited period, as part of the peace process.'' An uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Thirteen Israelis and more than 320 Palestinians have been killed. A separate resolution passed Thursday `` acknowledges the proclamation of the State of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. It says the designation `` <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'' will be changed to `` Palestine'' in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> system but the change would not constitute <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> recognition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and is invited to participate in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> debates. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also opposed the second resolution, which passed 104-2 with 36 abstentions. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, told the assembly the resolutions `` are unhelpful and inconsistent with the search for peace.'' In a statement explaining the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vote, <PERSON> Petrone </PERSON> described <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision in the occupied territories as `` impractical and unrealistic.'' He said changing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reference from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> `` is vague and could be susceptible to various interpretations.

<HEAD>LaRouche Case Goes to Jury as Prosecutors Allege `Enormous Crime'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mail fraud conspiracy trial of political maverick <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates went to a federal jury Thursday, with defense lawyers proclaiming their innocence and government prosecutors charging they had committed `` an enormous crime _ a $ 30 million crime.'' After explaining the legal complexities for nearly an hour, Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sent the case to the jury of eight women and four men at midday, as Christmas carols chimed from a church tower outside the courtroom. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had said the jurors would deliberate through Saturday, if necessary, to reach a verdict in the case involving <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 66, head of a controversial political movement and a perennial independent presidential candidate. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> did not testify in his own defense during the 15-day trial, but <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> cautioned jurors not to let that influence their decision. The judge also said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political views were irrelevant to the case, and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> denied defense lawyers' suggestions that the government was trying to `` get at Mr. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> or quiet a political movement.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six of his fund-raisers and other aides are charged with mail fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to raise more than $ 30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of repaying them. In addition, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is accused of conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by having all his personal expenses _ housing, meals, clothing, travel and even haircuts _ paid by various corporations he controls, and claiming he had no taxable income. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has not filed federal income tax returns for any year since 1978, government prosecutors said. His lawyers contended he had received `` non-taxable compensation'' as an employee of his organization. If convicted of all 13 counts against him, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million. In the final closing defense argument, attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said his client, fund-raiser <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, and his colleagues solicited loans with good-faith assurances that they would be repaid as promised. Waving his arm at each of the seven defendants, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told the jurors, `` They are not guilty, and I ask you to say so.'' In his rebuttal, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his associates knew their organization was in such dire financial straits that it was `` a bankruptcy waiting to happen,'' but that they never warned prospective lenders they probably would n't get their money back. Defense lawyers asked the jurors to question why <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> fund-raisers would `` cut off their life blood'' by defrauding loyal supporters. To this, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> responded that `` they were n't the life blood of this organization. These supporters were being bled dry.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> accused the LaRouche people of treating their lenders with `` cynicism and disregard,'' an attitude he said resulted in `` an enormous crime _ a $ 30 million crime.'' He said there was only one issue to decide: `` Did the defendants tell the truth when they tried to borrow money from people _ did they tell the truth, or did they lie?'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> reminded the jurors that membership in a political organization, even one with `` honest albeit controversial views,'' is lawful under the Constitution and is not evidence of any criminal activity. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political movement embraces a number of unorthodox positions, and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain world events. It has alleged that prominent figures suchy as former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> participate in those conspiracies. Some <PERSON> Larouche </PERSON> supporters also have advocated a quarantine for AIDS victims and have been accused of harboring anti-Semitic views.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Several soldiers who joined a rank-and-file rebellion that brought Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to power three months ago have been discharged for insubordination, an army official said Thursday. `` We can not let anarchy reign over the armed forces of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florestant </PERSON>, secretary general of the military staff, told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> order said in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> that it has expelled a Haitian activist priest it accused of instigating violence and exalting class warfare. The Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was the apparent target of a September attack on a church that killed 13 people. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that over the weekend several soldiers were discharged in the southern town of <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayes </LOCATION>, nine each from garrisons in the northern towns of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION> and four in the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Aquin </LOCATION>. The station said all the ousted soldiers supported the Sept. 17 coup against former leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and the nationwide purge of unpopular officers that followed it. <PERSON> Florestant </PERSON> said the soldiers were not discharged because of their support for the September mutiny but because of their insubordination after the coup. `` We can not accept that orders come from the bottom of the hierarchy,'' <PERSON> Florestant </PERSON> said. `` If an enlisted man had been stirred up and no longer wants to obey orders thinking he has become a political figure, he may be sanctioned in conformity with the regulations of the army.'' <PERSON> Florestant </PERSON>, who was himself appointed to his post after the coup, said the discharge orders were issued by regional commanders and not the army high command in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Soldiers said they ousted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> because they were disgusted by state-sponsored violence. They ousted nearly 60 officers accused of being repressive and linked to the former <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship. Their demands included a return to democratic rule, respect for human rights and better living conditions for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,000-man army. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> came to power after former President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986, ending 29 years of famly dictatorship. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, 35, has led calls for uprooting the vestiges of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime. In September, he was escaped during a bloody attack on his church in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> during a Sunday Mass by thugs linked to the ousted regime. Thirteen people were killed and more than 70 were wounded. A communique issued in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> had rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his behavior, which they described as `` in contrast with his <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> and priestly vocation.'' `` The type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious contrast with the clear will of the founder -LRB- of the order -RRB-,'' the statement said. `` In addition, the incitement to hate and violence, the exaltation of class struggle, go directly against that fidelity to the -LRB- teaching -RRB- of the church that forms a living part of the Salesian spirit.'' <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has been at odds with superiors of his <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> order in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for some time. He was ordered to leave his homeland and go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by Oct. 17, but he defied the order and remains in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The order's spokesman, the Rev. <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, said the decree, ratified by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> last week, did not change <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s status as a priest.

<HEAD>Censors Approve Controversial Director's Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Film censors in their first open meeting ever approved a controversial movie about a young man who can not cope with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new competition and commits suicide, an official paper said Thursday. The censors decided that the movie, tentatively titled `` Transmigration,'' can be released uncut to Chinese theaters, the Guangming Daily said. The movie is directed by <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianxin </PERSON> and produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Xian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION>, which in recent years has produced <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most technically innovative and politically daring films. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>'s first feature movie, `` The Black Cannon Incident'' in 1985, was cut by censors but still caused an uproar with its attack on mindless bureaucracy. It told the story of a telegraphed message about a missing chess piece that was misinterpreted by officials as a message about a real cannon. The Guangming Daily said censors in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> discussed <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>'s new movie in a two-hour session that was open to journalists for the first time. It did not say if the censors plan to make all their meetings open. Few Chinese films have dealt with the impact on ordinary lives of the economic reforms of the past decade, in which central planning and social welfare guarantees have been reduced in favor of the free market. Although the incomes of most Chinese have risen dramatically, some have actually slid and many people are unable or unwilling to obtain jobs or promotions based on merit. By showing the underside of the new competition in which some ca n't keep up, <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>'s movie could be seen as an indirect attack on government policy. But he said in an interview earlier this year that this was not his intent. The 34-year-old director said his goal was not to provoke controversy but to `` make films that reflect social problems'' so they can be corrected. The Guangming Daily said the censors decided that the movie `` is an authentic and honest attempt to portray the reactions of young people to the reform era in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and has artistic appeal.'' For decades, censors met privately and without objective guidelines to rule on the acceptability of movies and other entertainment. The Ministry of Culture is drafting a law that would establish rules for what is permissible. Although this would reduce the power of individual censors, some artists have expressed fears the law will halt the current process of gradual experimentation and liberalization.

 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, new owner of WCIX-TV, wants the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to take a high school radio station off the air, saying the station's signal interferes with the television station's audio transmission. In papers filed Tuesday with the agency, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> asked that WKPX, <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,000-watt progressive rock station, be denied a permanent license. <ORGANIZATION> WKPX </ORGANIZATION> has operated under a construction permit since it went on the air in February 1983. <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION> filed a protest shortly afterward. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Salo </PERSON>, a student in <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION>'s evening radio class, said those involved in the station `` see this as the big guy coming down on the little guy.'' `` And the little guy, in this case, is providing education to kids, promoting the arts, promoting local groups,'' <PERSON> Salo </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shacklan </PERSON>, vice president for programming for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television stations, said WKPX should n't have been allowed to broadcast on its frequency in the first place. `` It looks like the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> made a terrible mistake in ever granting that permit,'' he said. At that time, <PERSON> Shacklan </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was in the midst of a proceeding that would prohibit radio stations at the low end of the FM band in areas where they conflict with television audio transmissions. He said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has offered a proposal to <ORGANIZATION> WKPX </ORGANIZATION> that would allow it to stay on the air, but would not discuss details. <ORGANIZATION> WKPX </ORGANIZATION> officials would n't talk about it either, but said it was unacceptable. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> takes control of WCIX on Jan. 3.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Against French-Only Signs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a decision that could revive tensions between French and English speakers in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday against a provincial law requiring commercial signs to be written in French. The court's 5-0 ruling says <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> can order French on signs but can not prevent other languages being used as well. Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> was expected to announce Sunday how the provincial government will comply with the ruling. The language law, known as Bill 101, was passed in 1977 when the separatist Parti Quebecois held power. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform has supported multilingual signs. The <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> court ruling found section 58 of the law requiring commercial signs to be written only in French violated guarantees of freedom of expression provided in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> charter. But it said the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> government's goal of providing a French `` linguistic face'' for the province is valid. Constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> should be able to find a compromise. `` The judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties,'' lawyer <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> said in a television interview with <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Power in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> shifted from the English minority to the 81 percent French majority during the 1970s, a tumultuous decade of separatist sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a sovereignty referendum in 1980 Since then, Quebecers have focused on improved living standards and competitiveness. The province boasted 5 percent real growth last year and produced 40 percent of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s business administration students. It was a support base for the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last January. The court rulings stemmed from two separate cases, one involving five companies that used bilingual signs and the other from <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> stationer who insisted he had the right to use signs written only in English. `` It's not a good decision for us,'' Singer told reporters in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. `` We wanted the English language in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and we've been denied it.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownstein </PERSON>, whose chain of shoe stores is one of five businesses in the other case, told <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> television that all depends on what steps the provincial government takes. `` I think everybody's looking for a compatible solution to this dilemma,'' he said The most ardent supporters of French-only legislation want <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> to invoke a clause that could override the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. Yet English-speaking ministers in his government are expected to resign unless he acts to comply with it.

Steroid users of either gender may also show liver disorders and `` ` roid rage,'' which is increased aggression and antisocial behavior A study of steroid-taking athletes published earlier this year found mental problems ranging from deep depression to impulsive buying sprees and outbursts of violent rage. Anabolic steroids are different from anti-inflammatory steroids, which are commonly used in medicine.

 Once again the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is going to let processors keep on making old-fashioned country hams until paperwork on a new food safety requirment is completed. The deadline for ham producers to comply with new federal regulations was supposed to be Dec. 31, 1988. But then the previous deadline was supposed to be last Dec. 31. And the one before that was Dec. 31, 1986. There also was one on Aug. 6, 1985. Now, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, the new deadline will be Dec. 31, 1989 _ or whenever the agency finally approves the new rules, spokeswoman <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Goins </PERSON> said. The lengthy rule-making procedure involves those hams often seen on grocery shelves in cloth bags, or hanging from rafters in country stores. They must be scrubbed to remove mold and then soaked or boiled a couple of times to reduce the salt content. They're the kind of hams for which someone had to invent red-eye gravy and, in some parts of the country, grits. As the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> defines them, they're `` uncooked, cured, dried, smoked or unsmoked pork products made from solid meat.'' Typically, country or dry-cured hams are treated with salt and then put in a smokehouse to cure and age, a total process that can take months or even years. Most hams sold in supermarkets are wet-cured quickly in brine solutions and cooked before sale to consumers. In March 1983 the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> proposed rules intended to help prevent trichinosis, a disease caused by microscopic parasitic worms, or trichinae, that can occur in improperly cooked pork. The proposed rules were directed at ready-to-eat pork products and dry-cured country hams. Shortly after the original proposal was adopted on Feb. 6, 1985, the agency learned that some federally inspected ham producers were using old-fashioned methods that did n't meet the new <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> requirements and were ordered to show by Aug. 6, 1985, that their curing procedures were safe. The country ham industry protested, so the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> allowed more time. One compelling reason for the extensions of time for compliance was that no trichina problems had been associated with the dry-cured hams. `` These traditional processing methods have been permitted because they are decades-old methods believed to be effective in destroying trichinae,'' says <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` We are researching the safety of traditional trichina control methods and developing a proposed rule for issuance in early 1989,'' he said. `` After we receive public comments on that proposal, we will develop new regulations.'' But just in case the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s rule-making machine is slower than officials hope, the compliance deadline was extended another full year.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spares President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> one politically difficult decision, but gives him another arduous task: overseeing that dialogue. The decision by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration guarantees that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s explosive problems will face <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as soon as he enters the Oval Office on Jan. 20, even though the vice president said Thursday, `` There's no game plan, there's no five-point program.'' Although initial contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are to begin in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, later this week, there is little doubt that the turnabout decision clears the way for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to try to bring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> into direct negotiations. With tensions high on both sides of the 40-year-old dispute, such a task could be monumental. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not only will have to deal with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, whom just a week before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration had branded a terrorist, but he'll have to do it in a way that avoids souring relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed Thursday that the initiative, which he fully supported, was `` a dialogue, not negotations.'' `` Let's see how things evolve. My position remains the same. I want to see direct talks between, for example, between King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Israelis,'' he told reporters. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the tough decision so <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't have to do it. But he conceded the action could be helpful to the next administration. `` This is one step further down the road in the pace process and should provide for new options,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had conferred with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before making the final decision, although had not given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto power over it. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s announcement Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would initiate a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> saved <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from having to expend his own political capital in sorting out the issue. Less than a month after he denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa and barred him speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on grounds he was a terrorist, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader had met three conditions long insisted on by the administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he fully supported the decision to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, in light of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s assertion that he had met the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions: recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, a renunciation of terrorism and acceptance of two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace resolutions. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have stressed that this country remains committed to the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and still opposes an independent Palestinian state, the decision reversed a longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has shown no indications it is willing to follow suit. Its government still refuses to deal with what it views as a terrorist organization devoted to its destruction. Major disputes continue to divide <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, including the status of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had more experience in foreign affairs than any president since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, his choice for secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, has relatively little background in that area. However, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s reputation as a non-ideological problem solver, honed in exchange-rate and trade negotiations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic allies in his 2 -LCB- years as treasury secretary, could help make up for this lack of experience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign record provides few clues to the kind of positions he might take as talks progress on the Palestinian issue. For the most part, the vice president dodged most specific questions concerning the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, as did Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did speak forcefully during the campaign of his dedication to U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation, and he said he would not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or back an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ echoing administration positions of the day. It remains to be seen whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s legacy to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be a blessing or a curse. Asked Thursday if he would prefer that the talks wait until his administration starts next month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I become president on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.''

 <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> smiled at the television in his hotel suite when it carried the news that ended months of secret meetings, and last-minute quibbles over words in two languages not his own. The Swedish foreign minister guided the diplomacy culminating in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Wednesday night. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s effort to bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> together began on a trip <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> made to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in March. During that visit he saw the Palestinian uprising, now a year old, against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` I met with about 100 boys shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, some of them paralyzed for life,'' he told reporters Thursday. The 64-year-old Swedish diplomat went to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and talks with two <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders convinced him they wanted a separate Palestinian state rather than the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> had preached for decades. Egyptians, Saudi Arabians and envoys from several European nations were involved in negotiations that followed. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and hinted to the journalists of contacts with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> acted as `` a postman'' delivering messages, but added: `` I confess we have written some of the letters, too.'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhlouf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegate to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, said the Swedes did most of the diplomatic maneuvering. `` They worked very hard until we achieved this result,'' he said just after the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announcement. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> described his role to a few reporters early Thursday morning, and at a crowded news conference later. He told the news conference he approached American Jews, not Israelis, because he did not want the Israeli government to know about his activities in advance. `` The most crucial event was the meeting with the Jewish personalities from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' attended by <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hassan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, `` a fortnight before -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, a prominent member of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish delegation at the secret meeting. <PERSON> El-Hassan </PERSON> is a leading figure in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and a confidant of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. After the meeting, the foreign minister said, he wrote a document expressing the agreements reached and both sides agreed to sign it. The document was not made public until last week, when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> to meet with Ms. <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> and other American Jews. Most of the meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> dealt with strategy for persuading the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>'s last maneuvers were performed Wednesday afternoon, when he settled arguments over which words in English and Arabic the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would accept in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s announcement that he renounced terrorism and accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had said a speech by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> did not meet American conditions for contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. That speech and his statement Wednesday seemed much the same, but <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s remarks at the news conference, in English, cleared up questions of language that had disturbed the Americans. He said all the ideas expressed Wednesday were in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech in Arabic a day earlier, but were `` split up and in different words.'' Arabs have a different way of making speeches than Americans, the Swedish diplomat observed: `` They use a lot of words. A lot of words always cause confusion, misunderstanding. ... If he -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -RRB- changes the words, the Americans say ` What's going on here?'.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the speech, for instance, that he `` condemned'' terrorism, and at the news conference that he `` renounced'' it. <PERSON> Makhlouf </PERSON> said one word covers for both concepts in Arabic. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative added that another element contributed to the delay in a favorable response from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` They did n't believe their ears yesterday -LRB- Tuesday -RRB-. They needed to hear it again.'' <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, whose diplomatic involvement with the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict covers 25 years, said he felt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision was an important step in breaking the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> stalemate. `` The beginning of peace is always dialogue, but it has a long way to go,'' he said.

 The government needs to funnel more money to the nation's colleges and universities and to the students who wish to attend them, a group of educators told a congressional panel on Thursday. Witnesses appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s education and health subcommittee said that diverting more resources to post-secondary education would pay off in the long run with a higher-skilled work force `` What we have done up to the present time in order to create a work force as motivated, skilled and dedicated as those we confront in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other industrialized nations has obviously not been adequate and can even be called tragically inadequate,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Trachtenberg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee released a report on Wednesday, the first day of the two-day hearing, that recommended ways to better American schools, including lengthening the school year, improving vocational education and other programs, and increasing the emphasis on basic skills such as reading and studying. But on Thursday, the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, emphasized what he said was a need to consider making post-secondary education available to all qualified students. `` Kindergarten through grade 12 education, which was adequate for the work force of a predominantly agricultural nation adapting to industrialization, is simply obsolete in today's complex and sophisticated high-tech environment,'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said. The educators who addressed the committee agreed, and argued that federal aid to colleges and universities has eroded in recent years. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said the inflation-adjusted value of the maximum <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> award for colleges costs has declined by 13 percent during the 1980s. <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> also noted that the numbers of minority students are projected to increase from one-fifth of all <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children under age 17 to one-third by the year 2000. In addition, by the turn of the century, more than one in seven workers will be non-white, he said. `` The federal government, the states and institutions must develop a partnership in providing the financial resources and educational programs that will enable all our citizens to develop to their full potential,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Concerned About Earthquake Safety at Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientific advisory panel has urged the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to bolster the resistance to earthquakes of a weapons production reactor at the trouble-plagued <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. The panel also has concluded that to avoid confusion during a crisis, fewer personnel should be regularly assigned to the control room of the K reactor at the facility near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, S.C. The reactor currently is shut down because of maintenance and safety concerns. The recommendations came in a letter, released Thursday, to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> from the department's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Facility Safety, which <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> established earlier this year to assess safety programs at the nuclear plant. The three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are the nation's only source for tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the explosive power of modern nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished regularly. The advisory committee, chaired by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, declined to endorse a detailed DOE report presenting the department's strategy for restarting the K reactor. The just-completed DOE report outlined more than 160 separate tasks, calling for a complete overhaul of training, safety, management, operating and inspection procedures. In the advisory panel's 11-page letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> said that `` in our opinion ... the restart strategy document represents only an initial step in <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to develop sound operations at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' He added that `` we have broad concerns regarding safety philosophy, the overall criteria for restart and management.'' A DOE spokesman, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, said in response to the letter: `` Secretary <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has received this very constructive document. We believe that this an important part of the process, and we will respond in due course. Secretary <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> takes very seriously the recommendations of the advisory committee.'' Regarding earthquakes, <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> wrote, `` the seismic resistance issue in the restart strategy appears to be narrowly focused, does not indicate what must be completed before restart and tends to weaken the defense-in-depth philosophy.'' `` The seismic resistance criterion requires the capability to shut down, cool and monitor core status for a design basis earthquake -LRB- 0.2 g -RRB-, but it is not stated whether or not this needs to be completed before startup,'' he said. The `` g'' figure represents the strength of shaking that a structure undergoes during an earthquake. A level of 0.2 g would be approximately equivalent to the force exerted by a nearby quake with a magnitude of 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> noted in the letter that `` seismic criteria for the confinement system and the ECS -LRB- emergency core cooling system -RRB- were not included because neither is considered to be a ` primary safety system.' Crucial instruments are to be seismically qualified, but the instrumentation system -LRB- wiring, sensors, etc. -RRB- is neglected.'' `` We recommend that the ECS and confinement systems be seismically upgraded prior to restart,'' he said. Overall, <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> wrote, `` a rationale should be developed for deciding which upgrades are of immediate concern, which can be delayed until after restart and for how long.'' On the control room issue, the letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said current plans call for at least 12 people being in the K reactor control room when the reactor is restarted. They include five reactor operators, a technical support engineer, a shift adviser, a DOE <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> office onsite engineer, an environmental safety and health inspector, a DOE headquarters observer, a contractor oversight representative and a contract operations manager. `` This number is clearly excessive,'' <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> wrote. `` Indeed, it is difficult to see how such a large group could communicate effectively to provide prompt attention to any crisis situation. The list of people required for plant control room duties should be reviewed carefully and access limited to essential personnel.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday gave a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team 38 sets of remains believed to be those of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. It was the largest such repatriation since the Vietnam War ended. In a 50-minute ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military honor guard loaded the remains, each in metal caskets draped with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, onto an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. He said the plane took off for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> will determine if the remains belong to any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The remains are all associated with incidents in the northern provinces. They said they were found in lots of different circumstances and some of the remains were found by local villagers,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. He said the Vietnamese `` presented possible names associated with some of the remains.'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the Vietnamese also turned over information on 12 other missing Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified Vietnamese sources as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will step up the search for American MIAs and has agreed to accept more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams to conduct searches. The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved 27 sets handed over April 6. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said a four-member team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic experts examined 45 boxes of other remains in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and found some that they recommended for analysis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earlier reports had said 80 sets of remains were examined. The other three teams searched <PERSON> Binh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tri </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nghe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tinh </ORGANIZATION> provinces in north-central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, looking at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane crash sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. Their 10-day project ended Thursday. Investigators focused on 70 `` discrepancy cases'' where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says Vietnamese authorities should have information, including cases of captured airmen who were never returned. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said Vietnamese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical experts would meet in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible repatriations and discuss future projects. Since the war ended, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned remains of 172 Americans which have been identified by the Army laboratory. Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The repatriation Thursday was the seventh since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy, reached agreement in August 1987 with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to end months of deadlock on the MIA issue. The first American combat troops landed in then-South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in March 1965. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Peace Accords in January 1973 halted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighting in the conflict, which claimed the lives of about 58,000 Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975. Bitter political bickering between <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has often blocked accounting for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says it will not consider normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> withdraws all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and resolves the MIA issue. In <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials were continuing a joint excavation Thursday in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province to try to determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hearing Set Next Week for Final Trial Preparations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra case on Thursday scheduled a hearing for Dec. 21 to begin making final preparations for the trial of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who has previously indicated the trial could begin as early as late January, said in an order that he wanted to discuss procedures for screening potential jurors and other pre-trial housekeeping matters. The scheduling order provided yet another indication that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is determined to take the case to a speedy trial. On Monday, he strictly limited the number of classified documents that North can introduce into evidence and set a Jan. 3 deadline for listing those secrets he would propose to disclose at the trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rulings on secret documents earlier this week greatly increased the likelihood that all the charges against the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide will go to trial despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refusal to release secret documents the defense wants to publicly disclose. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> could still dismiss the central conspiracy charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON> if he determines that the withheld documents are needed to ensure that <PERSON> North </PERSON> gets a fair trial. But the judge made clear that he would not allow <PERSON> North </PERSON> to introduce documents that were not relevant to his defense simply to scuttle his prosecution. North is accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He faces a total of 14 felony counts, including charges he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, destroyed documents, pocketed travelers checks intended for the Contra leaders and illegally used a tax-exempt foundation to raise money to arm the rebels. Three co-defendants are set to be tried separately after <PERSON> North </PERSON>. At next week's hearing, the judge said he wanted to consider the type of questionnaire that would be sent to prospective jurors. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he also wanted to set a deadline for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to provide <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers with the grand jury testimony of the prosecution witnesses. The defense is entitled to examine that testimony to prepare cross examination. Questionnaires are usually sent to jurors for lengthy or high-profile criminal cases, such as the perjury trial of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>. The questions are designed to screen out jurors who would be unable to serve for a variety of reasons, including their inability to render a fair verdict or to understand complicated evidence. The completed questionnaires would be used as a basis to conduct jury selection in court. The North trial, which could last several months, may require the court to order as many as 1,000 questionnaires to screen out people who are unable to serve for the duration of the proceeding. The questionnaire would likely also ask prospective jurors whether they could judge the evidence in the case free of any influence from the extensive publicity that has surrounded the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Examiners Told To Watch for Banks Too Heavily Involved in Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The agency regulating nationally chartered banks ordered its examiners on Thursday to look for banks that have taken too big a chunk of the risky, but lucrative, business of financing leveraged buyouts. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates about 4,400 of the nation's 14,000 commercial banks, issued a set of guidelines for banks and government examiners to determine whether a bank's safety is endangered by involvement in the buyouts, or LBOs. Comptroller <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, in a memo to all national banks, said LBOs are `` considerably more complex and characterized by higher levels of risk than more traditional forms of commercial bank lending.'' But he acknowledged that LBOs have become an important source of income for banks as their traditional source of income _ straightforward loans to corporations _ becomes more scarce. LBOs are `` a legitimate business activity, as long as a bank's board of directoers and management follow prudent banking principles and guard against unnecessary credit and legal risks,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said In an LBO, such as <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 25 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders and take over the company. The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear the high debt levels in an economic downturn would endanger both the company and the group or bank that lends the money. In guidelines issued to bank examiners, the comptroller stressed diversification. He said a bank should have policies in place ensuring it is not overly involved in LBOs, does not lend too much to a single borrower and does not concentrate its lending to a single industry. Banks also should have policies curbing potential conflicts of interest in LBOs, to guard against getting sued by the losing parties in takeover battles. `` These are fundamental elements of any sound credit process, but they are especially important in view of the risk characteristics of many'' LBOs, the guidelines said. The cautions apply equally to banks that originate the loans and those that buy into the deals by participating through other, larger, banks, they said. The comptroller began working on the LBO guidelines after surveying the practices of 11 large money center banks and five regional banks in late spring and early summer. According to <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pricing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company that monitors large banks loans to corporations, banks have lent $ 70 billion in highly leveraged transactions since mid-1987. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits up to $ 100,000, said a substantial but undetermined amount of bank profits this year are coming from LBOs. Banks through the first nine months of this year reported record profits of $ 16.4 billion and likely will have earned more than $ 23 billion by the end of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Court Denies Visitation Rights To Sperm Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Dutch court on Thursday denied visitation rights to a sperm donor who sued for permission to visit his biological child, a court spokesman said. In the case, which has gained widespread national attention, a man who donated his sperm to a woman in a lesbian relationship sought the right to periodically meet the 15-month-old daughter born as a result of the artificial insemination. The donor claimed that an `` emotional attachment'' to the child developed over visits to the lesbian couple before and after the birth. A month ago, the Utrecht court ruled that the father was entitled `` in principle'' to sue for his rights. But Dutch family law does not contain specific provisions outlining the rights of sperm donors. The identities of both the plaintiff and the defendants in the lawsuit were not disclosed for reasons of privacy, and court hearings six weeks ago took place behind closed doors. In its ruling Thursday, the court said that `` in this particular case, the tensions caused by periodical visits would be very serious, and that is not in the interest of the child.'' The ruling also said that `` in cases such as this, visitation rights should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.'' It did not elaborate. During the hearings, the lesbian couple claimed that the friendship with the donor had ended and that serious personal conflicts had developed, according to their lawyer, <PERSON> Arnoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Willems </PERSON>. He added that the couple had rejected the idea of an anonymous donor so that the father could be identified if the child later would ask for his name. Artificial insemination by donated sperm is a widespread practice in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, but the strict confidentiality that prevents identification of the parties involved usually precludes such legal battles.

<TEXT>
 For the second consecutive year, flue-cured tobacco farmers in 1989 will see a hefty boost in federal marketing quotas, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the 1989 flue-cured quota will be 890.5 million pounds, up 18 percent from this year's 755 million pounds. The national acreage allotment will be increased to 426,485 acres from 379,588 acres in 1988. Allowing for overmarketings and undermarketings, the effective quota for 1989 will be up by about 90 million pounds from this year. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the flue-cured price support will be boosted to $ 1.468 per pound, an increase of 2.6 cents from 1988. The basic quota was increased on the 1988 flue-cured tobacco crop for the first time since 1975, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts, reflecting a draw-down on stockpiles and brisk demand. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said flue-cured tobacco farmers will vote in a mail referendum to be held Jan. 9-12 on whether to continue federal marketing quotas for the following three years, 1990, 1991 and 1992. A two-thirds majority will be required for the controls to continue.

<TEXT>
 A leading advocate for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children on Thursday urged President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make good on his campaign promises to offer more government help to disadvantaged youth, saying that eventually would save tax money as well as lives. <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, president of the private Children's Defense Fund, said the 1988 elections brought children's needs into the national spotlight, and that `` the debate over the next four to eight years will be on the form, level and timetable'' of programs to help youngsters and improve child care In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign proposal for a $ 2.2 billion children's tax credit is a `` welcome supplement'' to the child care bill that was considered but not enacted by the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> She noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called during the campaign for support of the federal nutrition program for pregnant women and children, increased <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> education efforts, expanded Medicaid health coverage for low-income families, and new education initiatives. `` I have confidence that he will keep his word,'' Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. `` ... I look forward, on many occasions, beginning in the State of the Union address, to his fulfilling it.'' She said that failing to meet children's needs early in life results in more costly problems later. `` At a time of massive deficits, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not afford to waste resources by failing to prevent and curb the deficits which cripple our children and cost billions in later remedial and custodial dollars,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s remarks were excerpted from her organization's upcoming report, `` A Children's Defense Budget: A Vision for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Children,'' to be released in January 1989 She recited a litany of troubling statistics about the levels of children living in poverty, infant mortality, gaps in prenatal care, low birthweight babies, children infected with the AIDS virus, broken families and homelessness. But she added: `` This is, for all its shadows, not a gloom and doom speech. It is a get-off-our-national-duff and save-our-future speech.'' Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said her organization's most immediate goals include: health insurance for poor families, expanding the federal nutrition program to cover all pregnant women, infants and children, making Head Start available to all needy children, ensuring that all children are fully immunized, making quality child care available to all families, and increasing the minimum wage. `` We believe these goals are doable in four or five years and should be pursued as fast as the delivery systems of these successful programs can effectively serve more children,'' she said. `` The longer we wait the more children we will lose.''

 Leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the new opening between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> a wary welcome Thursday and sought to reassure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will be alert to any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> tricks. `` This is good news and the right path to follow,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we would best be very careful that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any deception.'' Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move and called it a `` significant step toward advancing the peace process.'' `` It is consistent with what has been bipartisan American policy for over a decade,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said in a statement. `` Under that policy, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seeks to encourage direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions, intended to achieve a stable and lasting peace.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renunciation of terrorism were `` important statements'' but `` in light of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s record ... must be viewed with caution. He added that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action `` in no way represents or implies ... recognition of an independent Palestinian state'' and reaffirmed `` strong and unwavering support'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. The current <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-W </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, called the opening `` a diplomatic turn of events that should not go It is an opportunity that must be pushed forward despite the risks.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> added: `` As <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s real friends, it is time to recognize the shift in posture by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Our commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is firm and unswerving. But it must be tempered by the realization that there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward peace.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also sought to reassure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not mean any lessening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military support to its ally `` It will ... take more than words to convince <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said. `` Only the Israelis can determine what is best for their own security. So it should also be made very clear that there will be no attempt to impose a settlement on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Continued aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the top recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance, is necessary both to calm <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fears and `` as a clear signal to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and other parties that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed firmly to the independence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within secure borders,'' he said. Another staunch <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> supporter and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said he believed Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was sincere in believing the opening would advance the cause of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace `` I remain highly distrustful of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and of Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` A carefully worded and hedged statement -LRB- in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> -RRB- has to be put into the light of 20 years of terrorism and commitment to the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. I remain highly skeptical about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions.'' But <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> added, `` I think we should put those intentions to a test.'' Moves to call off the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and a rewriting of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter to eliminate a pledge to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would help prove the organization's good faith, he said. `` It's a risky move. I hope what we've done here contributes to negotiations towards peace,'' he said. `` You can not simply operate on the basis that the status quo can go on in perpetuity.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` may well be a historic step on the road to lasting peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> Only time will tell whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is genuinely prepared to live up the far-reaching conditions they have now accepted.'' `` It's a very positive thing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION> `` There are two parties to the conflict out there, the Israelis and the Palestinians. To not talk to one of the groups is to ignore reality.''

 Palestinians elated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> celebrated in the streets Thursday and credited their year-old uprising against Israeli rule for the change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. But Moslem fundamentalists rejected the decision as an American deception, threatening to deepen divisions among Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` America is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prayer leader <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s move failed to stop anti-Israeli protests in the occupied lands. Sixteen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, including an 11-year-old shot with a plastic bullet in the right eye, Arab hospital officials said. The wounded also included a 23-year-old Palestinian who suffered a serious gunshot wound to the liver in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>. The army confirmed two of the wounded and said it was checking further. Dozens of Palestinians marched through the streets of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, chanting pro-PLO slogans and carrying banners reading `` Yes to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Yes to the Palestinian state.'' A slogan sprayed on a wall in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> read: `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position is a victory for the uprising and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> diplomacy.'' Residents of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also expressed elation. `` Finally, the Americans are realizing that there is a Palestinian people,'' said a 35-year-old man who refused to give his name. The sentiments were echoed by Palestinian leaders. `` The uprising has succeeded beyond our expectations by changing the political climate,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter and editor of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said Palestinians in the occupied lands had put the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership under great pressure to translate the uprising into political gains, and this pressure led to recent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statements of moderation. `` All of a sudden, we were able to say publicly what we had been saying privately before: ` Let's recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Clear recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was one of three conditions set by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The others were renunciation of terror and acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing the right of all nations in the region to live within secure borders. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> acknowledged that Palestinians were deeply divided over the next steps. `` The road to peace is full of obstacles, such as the opposition of hardliners on both sides,'' he said. Moslem fundamentalists and hard-line <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions refuse to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They say all of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be returned to Palestinian control. <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, a prominent Moslem fundamentalist, said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made too many concessions to win <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s approval. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> gave everything to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and he got nothing in return but promises,'' the wheelchair-bound prayer leader said in an interview. He also expressed skepticism over the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. `` To all appearances, there is a change in American policy, but deep inside, there is nothing new,'' he said. But other Palestinians said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision marked a breakthrough in the stalled <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process, and they urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its refusal to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the Americans will pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the world can not live with -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s stubbornness,'' said <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter and businessman in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. `` No doubt, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to be isolated.''

Bidders paid more than $ 1.9 million for a range of historical letters and manuscripts but a collection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential autographs was not sold because it failed to reach the minimum set by the seller, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s letter was sent in 1795 to a group of officials protesting a treaty <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> negotiated to settle differences remaining after the Revolutionary War. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>'s treaty was criticized because the British continued violating the Treaty of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I can not but hope, that experience will shew, that the public interest required the course which has been pursued,'' the first president wrote to the officials.

 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> boasts of his skill in electronics, carpentry, mechanics and welding, and he made a mark in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> by raising money for African missions. Those were the talents, according to the British government, that the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest brought to the deadly work of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, it is alleged in extradition warrants rejected by <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and then by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, conspired to commit murder and cause explosions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> between 1975 and 1988. According to press reports attributed to British government sources, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> supplied the timers for scores of bombs and solicited cash and gold from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. A lean, clean-shaven man with a receding hairline, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is said by his brother <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> to able to speak nine languages and fly airplanes and run six miles a day. `` I am a member generally of the Catholic church,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said recently. `` I have been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abstinence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> since the age of 12, and I am still a teetotaler. `` After that I belong to no other organization either overt or covert. `` So, do I belong to the IRA? I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention,'' he told the Tipperary Star on Nov. 28, his only interview since his arrest. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is the focus of a diplomatic impasse across the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> wants to put him on trial, but <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, concluded that the priest could not get a fair trial in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> vowed that he will never stand before a British court, and staged a 22-day hunger strike in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> after the British sought his extradition. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was born June 26, 1930 in <LOCATION> Rossmore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tipperary </LOCATION>, one of six children in a farming family. He attended the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> school and the <ORGANIZATION> Pallottine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Thurles </LOCATION>, and was ordained June 6, 1954. `` While he was with us, we could see a man who was zealous, hard-working and very orthodox,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, rector of the students' house of the Pallottine Fathers of Thurles. `` In many ways he could have been an idealist.'' The young priest was assigned to mission work in the diocese of <LOCATION> Mbulu </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, where he was involved in well-digging projects. His colleagues, according to The Sunday Times, recalled him as a pastor who cared both for the spiritual and economic needs of his flock. In 1967, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was assigned as a curate in an east <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> church. In 1970 he returned to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to promote African missions. At that time, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> reportedly became preoccupied with the struggles in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has waged an armed campaign against British rule. In 1973, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> rejected a transfer to a church in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` He told me at that time that he felt in conscience bound to work for the dependents of prisoners and those who had died in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanly </PERSON>, the Pallottine provincial in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said in the Star interview that: `` I would travel through the airports principally of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to various parts of the world collecting a few pence _ more than a few pence, a lot of money.'' `` But I found that I would be just stopped at a frontier ... and I would be given no reason other than ` you ca n't pass.' So I decided if I could n't pass one way I was going to pass another way.'' Thus, he said, he traveled on a forged passport. According to British authorities, one of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was discovering a gadget called Memopark, a timer intended to remind a motorist when the parking meter expired. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> allegedly bought every Memopark, some 400 of them, in stock at a novelty shop in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1975. Subsequently, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sources have said, remains of the timers were found at the scene of 185 bombings in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1976, and timers were found in his possession. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> also went free when <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard was unable to develop evidence that he had committed any offense on Swiss soil. He was arrested, and freed, again in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in December 1976, in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in February 1977 and in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> the next month. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s last arrest was on June 30 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Belgian police said they found found timers, circuitry and manuals about bombs in his possession. `` In my living room they found all kinds of books,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told the Star. `` I am an excellent mechanic, very good with electronics, a good plumber, carpenter, welder. I have a variety of books on all these subjects. I have also books on music as I play the mandolin and banjo.''

 A wayward ball from a cricket match set off ethnic fights in which six people were killed, authorities in this southern port said Thursday. Police and witnesses said the trouble started Wednesday when some Mohajirs, Moslem immigrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, hit a cricket ball into a house owned by Pathans, an ethnic Pakistani group. A youth who tried to retrieve the ball was beaten and died of head injuries, and news of his death prompted clashes Thursday at a juncture of e Pathan and <ORGANIZATION> Mohajir </ORGANIZATION> neighborhoods in central <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, the reports said. Hospital officials reported the death toll. Security forces patrolled the streets Thursday night and there were no further reports of fighting. Mohajirs, who complain of discrimination, and Pathans, originally from northwestern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have battled repeatedly for a decade. Nearly 300 were killed in December 1986 during riots in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, a city of 9 million.

 Religious, professional and social leaders urged the government on Thursday to postpone presidential elections until a wave of ethnic violence that killed 109 people this week subsides. At the same time, rival Sinhalese and Tamil guerrillas called for boycott of Monday's election. Sinhalese extremists said the government was incapable of conducting fair balloting, and separatist Tamils blamed the two main candidates for violence that has wracked this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island for five years. A military spokesman said Sinhalese radicals shot and stabbed to death eight villagers in the south. He said the extremists left scribbled warnings saying: `` This is the fate of government spies.'' Later Thursday, soldiers captured an underground hide-out used by the Sinhalese attackers, who have waged a campaign of terror and intimidation to overthrow the government, the spokesman said. Four rebels were killed and 23 surrendered, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity, he said. A government statement said 21 prisoners were killed by police after anti-government militants bombed open a wall of the medium-security Welikade prison near <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. Earlier, officials said only two died. A total of 221 prisoners escaped but 133 were recaptured, the statement said. The remainder remain free. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella for 30 professional, religious and social groups, said President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> should call off the elections because of the escalating violence. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, is prohibited by law from seeking a third six-year term. The 82-year-old leader has said he will dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and step aside Tuesday. Opposition leaders say that will be too late. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has 9.3 million eligible voters among its 16 million people. Sinhalese extremists say the government's peace accord with Tamils grants too many concessions to the minority people who have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. Nearly 10,000 people have died since the war started in 1983. Predominantly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of the island's population, contend they are denied jobs, education and money for development by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese majority The biggest and most militant Tamil group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday said the two main presidential candidates _ <PERSON> Ramasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ `` have been instrumental in creating the ethnic conflict and have been responsible for the genocide of Tamils.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will allow a 17 percent increase in the amount of raw sugar that can be imported from 39 foreign countries in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said next year's quota was set at about 1.24 million short tons of 2,000 pounds each, up from about 1.06 million tons in calendar 1988. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> led the list with a 1989 allocation of 185,328 metric tons, followed by <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, 166,374, and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 152,685. Officials said the quota for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 30,537 tons, `` is not allowed to be shipped at this time'' and may later be allocated to other countries, as was done last July with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 1988 quota. Reduced production because of this year's drought and rising demand were the main reasons for boosting the quota so sharply, officials said. In metric tons, which have about 2,205 pounds each, the 1989 quota will be almost 1.13 million tons.

 Directors of a charitable foundation were accused Thursday of siphoning off nearly $ 7 million to support their own lavish habits, including chauffeured limousines, nights at the opera and trips to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In a lawsuit filed in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said officials of the <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Frances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spingold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> systematically looted the organization's coffers from 1983 to 1988, depleting its assets by almost 50 percent In particular, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, the foundation's chief administrative officer, took more than $ 5 million in salary to perform `` simple administrative duties. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> _ and not the charities he was supposed to support _ was the chief beneficiary of the foundation. <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> lawyer, allegedly billed the foundation at a rate of $ 275 to $ 350 an hour for his services. His hours increased, according to the attorney general's office, from an average of 29 per week in 1984 to an average of 77 per week in 1986 and 1987. In its lawsuit, the attorney general's office demanded the removal of <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON> as directors of the foundation and demanded repayment of losses resulting from their alleged misconduct. At <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' request, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauchamp </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order barring <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> and four other defendants from using any more of the foundation's funds. Calls to the foundation for comment were referred to <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargel </PERSON>, who was in court and could not immediately be reached According <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office, the Spingold foundation was established in 1955 by <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Spingold </PERSON> to make contributions to charitable, educational and religious organizations. The foundation's assets have decreased from $ 12.5 million in 1983 to $ 6.4 million this year, his office said. No figures were available on how much the foundation gave to organizations during that period. <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Spingold </PERSON> died in 1958; his wife and her son, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON>, supervised the foundation until both of them died of natural causes in 1976. <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> has served as director and chief administrative officer of the foundation since 1975, while <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Spingold </PERSON>'s grandson, has been a director since 1977 and president of the foundation since July 1987 The others named in the suit are <PERSON> Nedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasbourger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendlowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>. According to an affidavit filed by <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office, the defendants' alleged excesses included dinners; a trip by <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> and his wife to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; the purchase of an unneeded luxury office for the foundation; and a trip to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In addition, the affidavit charged that <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> leased automobiles, including a Mercedes and a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>, at foundation expense, and that he and other directors allegedly hired chauffeured limousines to take them `` to the theater, opera and ballet, and to department stores for shopping, gala benefits, and airports.''

<HEAD>Life Expectancy For Blacks Drops Second Consecutive Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The life expectancy for blacks has dropped for two consecutive years for the first time since 1970, when mortality data was first broken down by race, according to a federal report. While the white population experienced an increase in life expectancy, to a record high of 75.4 years, from 1985 to 1986, the black rate declined to 69.4 years, the same level as in 1982. Despite that most recent two-year decline, the report notes that `` the largest gain in life expectancy between 1970 and 1986 was for both black males and females, 5.2 years, followed by white males, 4 years, and white females, 3.2 years.'' The annual figures, released recently by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, are derived from comparing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bureau of the Census data with death certificates filed in the 50 states and <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The 55-page report, which contains dozens of tables breaking down death rates in a variety of ways such as age and sex in addition to race, makes no attempt at explaining any of the trends shown by the figures. However, the tables show there was a 15 percent increase in homicides among blacks between 1985 and 1986, compared to a 5 percent increase among whites. Homicide was the fifth leading cause of death among black males and the ninth leading cause of death among black females in 1986. Homicide was not among the top 10 causes of death for either white males or females. Accidents, the fourth leading cause of death overall, increased 8 percent among blacks and 4 percent among whites. Death rates among blacks were lower in 1986 than the previous year for heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, atherosclerosis, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis and congenital anomalities. Overall, the death rate for blacks was 1.5 times that of whites in 1986, with wide fluctuations among the 15 causes of death. For example, blacks were half as likely to commit suicide as whites and 5.8 times more likely to die from homicide. Blacks were 1.2 times more likely to die accidentally than whites, but slightly less likely to die in an automobile accident. The only other category where the 1986 death rate was lower among blacks than whites was pulmonary disease and associated conditions.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> had a busy speaking schedule in the first weeks of 1987, jetting to places like <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> as part of the multimillion-dollar congressional honoraria circuit. Between Jan. 5 and Feb. 6, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Republican made 18 speeches, all of them to major defense contractors who have more than passing interest in hearing from a member of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that has a major role in Pentagon spending. The whirlwind schedule was not without its reward: $ 29,000 in speaking fees from the likes of <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, an amount that the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says is just $ 1,853 below what the median <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household collected in income for all of 1987. Young did n't keep all of his earnings. His financial disclosure statement says he gave $ 3,200 to charity, which brought his speechmaking net to $ 25,800, or $ 84 less than <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules allowed him to keep. He made no more for-pay speeches after Feb. 6. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s press secretary, said Thursday the lawmaker's honoraria appearances were lumped together because he only schedules them during times when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> either is not in session or has a light schedule, as generally occurs in January. He said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> generally works a 7 a.m.-10 p.m. day while on these visits, meeting with company officials and touring plants, not just speaking for a fee. `` He learned something from these trips,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. Young is not unique among the 390 representatives and 87 senators who in 1987 pulled in $ 9.8 million on the honoraria circuit _ a controversial perk being targeted for oblivion by reformers, a federal pay commission and influential lawmakers like <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The commission said that public faith in the integrity of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is threatened by the steady growth in honoraria, which rose 30 percent from 1986 to 1987. `` The only principled argument that can be made for the practice of accepting honoraria is that official salaries are far too low and must be supplemented for a public official to meet his family obligations,'' the panel said. Its recommendation to the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: ban honoraria and raise congressional pay from $ 89,500 a year to $ 135,000. The champion honoraria earner for 1987 was Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the panel that originates most tax legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> is so much in demand by a broad segment of businesses, industries and trade associations that his 22 paid appearances in January 1987 brought in $ 76,500 in honoraria. Even though the powerful chief tax-writer of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had taken in more than nearly three times the $ 25,884 that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules allowed him to keep, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> did n't withdraw from the 1987 honoraria circuit. He kept talking, and by year's end his voice had brought in $ 245,000 _ $ 25,844 for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, $ 219,156 for the LaVerne and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> Charity Fund. A spokesman says the fund's money was distributed about 50-50 among <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and non-Chicago health, ethnic, religious and educational groups with bona fide charity status. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> does n't release their names. `` We've been running a Robin Hood program _ taking from the tax lawyers and giving to the poor,'' says the spokesman, who declined to be quoted by name. In 1987, $ 2.25 million of the $ 9.8 million in congressional honoraria ended up going to charities and nonprofit institutions _ an income source that could dry up if the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accept the pay commission's plan. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s spokesman says the chairman will continue his philanthropy even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to abolish speaking fees, which are frequently paid by groups with a financial stake in a particular lawmaker's committee and floor votes. The spokesman says <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> will help his favorite charities raise money by volunteering to be a drawing card at their fund-raising events. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was one of three lawmakers who went into six digits on the 1987 honoraria circuit. In second place with $ 118,588 was <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., who gave $ 94,938 to charity Third was Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., $ 106,050, with $ 80,000 to charity Both <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> kept less for themselves than Capitol Hill rules permit. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lets members keep honoraria earnings up to 30 percent of official salary, or $ 26,850. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the factor is 40 percent, or $ 35,800. In 1987, 44 senators took in less than this amount. Twenty-six of them listed no charitable contributions on their disclosure forms. The new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, was above average in honoraria earnings and below average in giving to charity. He took in $ 42,225, about $ 6,000 above the norm, and gave away $ 7,350, about $ 2,000 below the average senator's giving. One senator who will be able to watch next year's pay-honoraria debate with detachment is <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., who as vice president will fall under the existing ban on paid speechmaking by the executive branch and the judiciary In 1987, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was more active on the honoraria circuit than the average senator. He collected $ 49,255, kept $ 34,953 and gave $ 14,302 to charity.

<TEXT>
 Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at his side, on Thursday praised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, paying a farewell call on the retiring president, told reporters through an interpreter that he thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision `` helps to work toward the solution of a delicate problem.'' `` And now, talks will help us understand the conditions that are there for negotiations,'' he said. `` The decision of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government is very important because it solves the problem of finding a counterpart'' to talk for the Palestinian side, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said. Attending <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> later had lunch with the allied leader. At their meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> again for the Italian decision to provide a new home for a 72-plane <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter wing that is being relocated from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Most of the meeting was about Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech, `` the need for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> unity'' and efforts to correct the imbalance between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet bloc conventional forces, he added. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> told a news conference afterwards that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had prepared a decision on how to deal with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but the decision had been paralyzed by the lack of an acceptable spokesman for the Palestinians. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was a way around the obstacle, he added. Asked what his advice to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be at this moment, he replied: `` Be serene. Neither the Italian nor the European position favors one side against the other.'' The Italian government favors a negotiated solution to the conflict, he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> added that recent decisions by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> were contested by many Arabs and that the statements of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> were risky.

 A dozen children and teen-agers seemed to be enjoying themselves Thursday rummaging through boxes of clothes and toys. But the laughter and the smiles vanished as they remembered they did n't have a home or parents to return to. Eight days after an earthquake in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> sundered homes and families, officials can only guess at the number of children killed or left orphans. Many survivors are having nightmares, and the Soviet Children's Fund, a charity, sent a team of 11 child psychologists to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to help `` Who has trouble sleeping?'' psychologist <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhina </PERSON> asked the group of children, whose parents are dead or missing. Nearly all raised their hands and yelled, `` I do, I do!'' The therapy session had begun. The youngsters, from seven to 15 years old, were sitting in a recital hall of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s music conservatory. The building was converted into a children's relief center and the hall was filled with donated toys and clothes. `` Sit back and close your eyes,'' the pscychologist told the children. `` Frightening pictures may come to you. But forget about everything. Force yourself to see the best: the sky, birds.'' The children broke in with their own suggestions: flowers, a warm sun. Their eyes still closed, children were told to imagine themselves in a forest and told to care for dolls they had just received. <PERSON> Mukhina </PERSON> seemed to be trying to establish the dolls as a symbol of security to replace that which was lost with the disappearance of their parents. `` Hold the doll, which loves you,'' she said, pushing the new toys into the children's embrace. `` Take care of the dolls. Lead them into the world. Keep everything frightening away from your doll.' Then she concluded: `` When I count to three you will say goodbye to your forest and tonight you will rejoin it and sleep peacefully. The suggestion worked so well that 12-year-old <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudliny </PERSON> did n't open her eyes again when the count ended. But when she woke up, the shock of the quake returned and she began to cry. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhanov </PERSON>, head of the Children's Fund, was watching and went over to embrace <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> and comfort her. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s 15-year-old brother <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON> told in a matter-of-fact way what he could not get out of his mind. `` We had an English class. We sat writing. The teacher said tomorrow there will be a quiz. Then everything started to shake,'' <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON> said, recalling when the quake struck his hometown of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> at 11:41 a.m. `` ` Let's get out!' we shouted,'' <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON> said. A classmate of <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON>'s, who identified himself as <PERSON> Saak </PERSON>, described how the class managed to get outside and saw one entire class crushed as they tumbled from the third floor to the ground. Soldiers later pulled up in a tank and took the students away. <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON> said he does n't know what happened to his parents. In an interview, <PERSON> Mukhina </PERSON> explained that she tries to help the children cope with the tragedy by `` replacing negative emotions with good thoughts.'' But she said the process is likely to take years. In the meantime the children are staying in a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> school, playing with their new toys and going to movies and concerts. Authorities are arranging longer term care in sanitariums throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexanyants </PERSON>, an Armenian doctor specializing in child health care. Some Armenians say the children should be kept in the small southern republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> rather than being sent out to other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Alexanyants </PERSON> said all eventually will return.

 Nicaraguan soldiers fired on Honduran patrols three times this month in `` provocative'' attacks along the border, the government said Thursday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> sent a protest note to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON>. There was no immediate response from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> listed these inidents, without mentioning casualties: _ Dec 7: Nicaraguan troops attacked a Honduran patrol with grenades and rifle fire near <LOCATION> Walpauanta </LOCATION>, but the two soldiers and two civilians did not return fire. In a separate incident the same day, 24 Nicaraguan soldiers in a boat on the <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tossed grenades and fired rifles at a Honduran patrol near <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> and the patrol fired back. _ Dec 11: A Sandinista patrol exchanged rifle fire with Honduran soldiers in the Teotecacinte border post. The protest said the attacks `` appear to indicate that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is looking for another front to execute its provocative actions that in no way contribute to lowering tensions in border areas.'' Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, Honduran mlitary commander, said Thursday he and the defense chiefs of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> agreed in recent meetings that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was impeding regional peace. He did not say when the meetings took place. `` We've met and reached the conclusion that the road to peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> runs through <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' the Nicaraguan capital, he told reporters. Relations between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> became strained after U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, began their war against ther leftist Sandinista government in 1981. The rebels have bases on Honduran territory.

<HEAD>Government Threatens Aid Cutoff Over Cleveland Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday gave <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials two months to adopt an automobile pollution inspection plan for the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> area or face a cutoff of $ 20 million in federal highway funds. Unless the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> complies with the federal Clean Air Act by ordering tailpipe inspections in populous <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, federal highway money to the county will be blocked 60 days after the order is published in the Federal Register. In addition, carbon monoxide-spewing smokestack industries will be denied new construction permits, and air pollution control grants to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will be reduced by $ 64,000 under the sanctions given final <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approval. If those penalties do n't prod state lawmakers into enacting a tailpipe inspection bill, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is ready to wield yet another club: the loss of sewage construction grant money, perhaps $ 20 million worth. Spokeswomen for Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said avoiding the sanctions has become a top priority for the new year. `` We are working with the governor's office on draft legislation which we hope to introduce as early as possible in January,'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> said. `` I would give the federal government what they've asked for.'' Press Secretary <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the governor believes there is time to beat the 60-day deadline. State Sen. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Democrat, agreed. He predicted the penalties would force the Legislature to enact a tailpipe testing bill, though `` with a lot of kicking and screaming.'' `` <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will come into compliance,'' he said. `` We ca n't afford to lose those funds.'' <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was singled out because of violations of federal air pollution standards, specifically levels of carbon monoxide. In high concentrations, the poisonous gas can cause dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, headaches and delayed reaction times. Tailpipe inspections are considered an effective antidote for high carbon monoxide levels because 85 percent of the gas comes from the exhaust fumes of cars and trucks. Though no other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city currently is suffering the loss of highway construction money, there are about 10 other areas under construction bans, including <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> suburbs, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and some of its suburbs, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. Highway funding sanctions were lifted recently against <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> after a year and a half; four areas in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were under the same restrictions for nearly two years, but those also have been lifted, he said. Even with the sanctions, many highway projects will continue to get their full federal funding because the government does n't withhold money for safety improvements and projects that have a beneficial effect on air quality

<HEAD>Opposition Says British Intelligence Agency Among The Worst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday derided MI5, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s counter-intelligence agency, as one of the worst secret services in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and said it has a long history of recruiting and promoting Soviet agents. `` It has made itself ridiculous because it believes it is above scrutiny,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> deputy leader <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON> spoke during a parliamentary debate on a bill proposed by the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to license bugging and break-ins by the agency. The Security Services Bill will give a basis in law for the first time to the 79-year-old agency, whose existence successive governments long refused even to acknowledge. <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>'s attack reflected complaints by the opposition and civil liberties groups that the bill fails to provide any parliamentary control over MI5. Its chiefs will continue to report secretly to the prime minister and the home secretary. The agency became the focus of renewed public attention during a three-year court battle, which the government finally lost this year, to suppress the memoirs of ex-agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. His book `` Spycatcher'' includes charges that MI5 tried to destabilize a Labor government. Several Soviet agents from the British upper classes _ <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> _ were recruited at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s to work for the British secret services. MI5 and MI6, its sister intelligence-gathering agency, have been dogged by subsequent spy scandals. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> is hearing complaints arising from charges in 1985 that MI5 agents tapped the telephones of anti-nuclear campaigners and labor union leaders on the instructions of Cabinet ministers. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> on Thursday denied that MI5 is `` locked in some time warp of the 1950s, forever fighting shadows that have long since disappeared.'' But he refused to comment on whether agents have tapped labor leaders' telephones. `` I am not going to comment on past operations,'' he said. Under the bill, agents will require a warrant, now unnecessary, from <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> to bug or break into property, and an independent commissioner will monitor the granting of warrants. The bill also provides for a tribunal of lawyers to hear complaints from people who suspect they are targets of improper surveillance. But critics charge official secrecy laws ban revealing the activities of the secret services.

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader Sees Chance For Reconciliation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity's <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Thursday that he sees increasing prospects for agreement with the communist government, perhaps through long-awaited `` round table'' talks that would include his banned union movement and the church. `` There is a chance now. I do n't know if it is honest or just a fake. But I can not destroy it. There are many new elements which we must notice,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at his first news conference since returning from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Monday. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> meanwhile told a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> audience, `` We are looking for roads of still wider national reconciliation. `` There is still only one criterion: a feeling of responsiblity for the country and the good of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said in a speech Thursday marking the party's 40th anniversary. Parts of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s news conference were broadcast Thursday night on state-controlled television, the first time his weekly meeting with reporters was treated by the TV as a normal news event. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity, the independent union movement in the Soviet bloc, remains ready for `` serious talks which would assure pluralism.'' `` Now, at the end of the year, there are buds of hope to obtain solutions accepted by both sides. The round table is a chance which could give life to these hopes, which were born out of seven years of mutual brawling.'' Plans to hold the talks broke down in November when authorities refused to guarantee their willingness to relegalize the labor federation, crushed in the martial law crackdown seven years ago this week. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s appearance in a nationwide TV debate on Nov. 30 and the increasing attention given his views in the state-controlled media this month indicated a growing acceptance of the Solidarity leader by officials. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s being allowed to go to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also underlined his improved standing with officials. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> on Tuesday praised <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statements during his trip and said the talks could discuss the future of trade union pluralism Asked about Urban's comments, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, `` It is very close to dotting the ` i,' but the dot is still missing.'' Opposition sources said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will meet this weekend with a council of 60 independent intellectuals and worker activists that he consults on major policy issues. In another development, the party leadership announced a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting for Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss political reforms and the role of the party. Urban has said the plenum could bring new impetus to national agreement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity has been maintaining contacts with authorities through a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> intermediary, the Rev. <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orszulik </PERSON>. He said the talks would cover unions, economic problems and ways `` to cooperate to improve living conditions.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, agreed this year to end a wave of strikes demanding relegalization of Solidarity after the government agreed to the talks.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will continue diplomatic and economic sanctions imposed in an effort to force out Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will not be disposed to abandon the pressure for change and democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... no matter what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might want,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told a dinner Wedneday night of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and Industry of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The embassy released his remarks Thursday. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would end sanctions when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resigned as as commander of the Panamanian military, a position he uses to control the country. `` The beginning of political stability only can be achieved if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> relinquishes power,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. He denies the accusations. `` In 1988, we have observed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a progressive deterioration of human rights, a growing disdain for justice and respect for laws, the unconstitutional ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, and the loss of confidence in the economy,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> declared. He said the government nominally led by President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s dismissal by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 26, after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions were not to blame for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and were not meant to hurt the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. `` The Panamanian economy can not begin its recovery unless the political crisis of this country is resolved in a satisfactory manner for all Panamanians,'' he said. Economic sanctions, which which forbid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations to pay taxes to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` are doing what they were created to do: they're preventing cash from reaching the hands of an illegal regime,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeks an excuse to violate the 1977 treaties under which control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> will be given to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said canal security can be guaranteed only with `` genuine progress toward democracy and a civilian and constitutional government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said presidential elections scheduled for May 7 would be worthless if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained in his post. `` As long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> clings to power, we do n't believe that the elections can be accepted by Panamanians as the product of an authentic process,'' he said. Most opposition parties take a similar position, arguing that sufficient election and press guarantees do not exist. The government has closed three newspapers, three radio stations and a television station.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for Arrow Air accepted the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that ice on the wings caused a plane crash at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, that killed 256 Americans three years ago. The letter to the board from lawyer <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> was obtained Thursday by the Canadian Press news agency. It said that while Arrow does `` not agree with some matters contained in the report, they do accept the report as published and do not propose in any way to challenge the same.'' He did not elaborate on which matters the company disagrees. Arrow Air was the operator of the charter DC-8 that crashed on Dec. 12, 1985, killing 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and eight crew members. The soldiers were heading home to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, from peacekeeping duties in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The board concluded Dec. 8 that ice on the wings was the likely cause, but a significant minority said in a separate opinion that an in-flight fire caused the crash. The often public disputes during the long investigation and the sharp split led to repeated calls here for a judicial inquiry. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said Arrow does n't want one. `` It is my clients' present view that they would not participate in any such review or inquiry, a view with which I wholly concur,'' he said. `` I hope the board will now be able to put this sad incident and its recently troubled history behind it having regard to the important role it must play in civil aviation in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' He said the release of the board's majority and minority reports means `` the issues on the whole have been raised.''

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Thursday of continuing supply flights to Nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional ban. Gen. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> is president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, also told a news conference that battle casualties in 1988 were dramatically lower than the previous year's total. He claimed Nicaraguan radar detected 10 clandestine supply flights into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in November. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported the rebels, known as Contras, since 1981, two years after a civil war in which the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> deposed the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stopped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels at the end of February but allowed distribution of non-lethal aid to continue in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. About 10,000 rebels returned to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to get the food and uniforms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said rebel forces totaled no more than 7,000, of whom about 2,000 were in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said the presence of Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> means a war situation still exists and the rebels `` can do damage.'' <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has an army of about 80,000, the largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and gets its military equipment from the Soviet bloc. The defense minister said government forces killed 2,226 rebels in 1988, down from 5,339 the previous year, and 611 Sandinista soldiers were killed compared with 1,613 in 1987. He said civilian casualties rose to 1,748 from 1,675 in 1987, but did not break the number down into dead and wounded. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the number rose because of kidnappings by rebel forces. The Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fire March 23 that called for the rebels to stop fighting in exchange for democratic concessions. Talks on details of the agreement reached a stalemate in September. Both sides stopped offensive operations March 21, when the talks began. The government has renewed the cease-fire each month since a formal 60-day truce ended May 31. On Thursday, the defense minister claimed the Contras had killed 69 civilians since the March agreement, wounded 79 and kidnapped 372. He said 70 soldiers had been killed, 73 were wounded and seven were missing. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, flanked by the military high command, said Nicaraguans should be prepared for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have made that claim repeatedly. He said Honduran forces have harassed Nicaraguan positions on the border to provoke a confrontation that would give <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> an excuse to request help from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal election officials, under court order to clarify how political parties can spend campaign funds, heard Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> spokesman warn Thursday that too much regulation could stamp out politicking at the local level. While other critics told the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that current rules have led to illegal use of so-called soft money, the national political parties lobbied for flexibility in what the state and local parties can do. The issue revolves around how to apply the federal election laws to the local entities who get money from the national parties and whose activity can provide overlapping benefit to presidential and congressional candidates. `` If you like a campaign that involves people at the local level, then do n't go down that slippery slope,'' of micro-regulation, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> told the commission. He warned that if the local parties are forced into complicated bookkeeping on what money is spent for federal and non-federal campaigns they will probably ignore the rules or simply bow out of campaigning. That would freeze out grassroots activity and shift to a total national TV campaign, he said. <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> and his Democratic counterpart, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, argued that where federal and local goals overlap, the local and state parties should not be saddled with complicated allocation formulas, but should be allowed to allocate the funds to federal and non-federal accounts in a way that best suits their situation. No matter how stringent the rules, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be able to accomplish complete fairness, <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said. `` You draw up the rules. I get paid to manipulate them,'' he said. `` Whatever you do is going to be maniplated to some degree.'' <PERSON> Rieser </PERSON> denied that the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> gives money to local and state parties only to help the presidential race. He said the party has an interest in local level politics as well. Different states have different political situations that would make it unfair to lock them into using a standard formula for how much of their activity benefits federal elections, versus local elections. For instance, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had a plethora of hotly-contested ballot initiatives and many tight legislative races on which the state and local parties invested heavily for slate mailers and get-out-the-vote activity. Other states had little state election interest and were more focused on the presidential race. The public hearing testimony was a step in <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> compliance with a federal court order that said the commission's rules were too vague on soft money, which is banned in federal elections but is permitted in many states. Soft money generally refers to union and corporate donations, as well as individual contributions in excess of the federal limit of $ 1,000. Such funds are banned in federal elections, but permitted in many states. The focus of the current <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> deliberations is how the parties should allocate funds to soft, or non-federal accounts, and to federal accounts for campaign activities that benefit both federal and non-federal candidates. Such activities include voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives as well as slate cards and administrative costs. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of Common Cause, a longtime critic of the system, said that both parties in 1988 `` brazenly flouted the limits imposed by federal law on the sources and amounts of permissable contributions in connection with federal elections.'' Noting that both parties had raised millions of dollars in soft money, he accused them of using the system to circumvent the limits on what they could spend for their presidential nominees by doing it through state party activity. <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rieser </PERSON> both said they knew of no examples of soft money being spent on the campaigns of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but they acknowledged that party spending at any level inevitably helps the top of the ticket. `` That sort of activity affects all elections,'' said <PERSON> Rieser </PERSON>. `` You ca n't help a legislative candidate without helping the top of the ticket,'' said <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>. `` Everything affects everything else.'' The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> raised in the neighborhood of $ 70 million this year, with about $ 20 million of that in soft money, <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said. However, those figures did not include another $ 25 million that was raised through the `` Victory'88'' program the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> set up in each state, with the funds going directly into state accounts rather than to the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>. The Democrats, said <PERSON> Rieser </PERSON>, raised about $ 60 million this year, with some $ 18 million of that in soft money. Both parties had programs to court high-dollar givers who contributed sums of $ 100,000 or more. The federal system permits an individual to give no more than $ 25,000 per year in federal election contributions, including to parties and candidates. But unlimited sums can be donated to non-federal accounts.

 Gas explosions believed caused by a faulty valve killed a 10-year-old girl on Thursday, injured four other people and heavily damaged 20 homes in a central West German town, officials said. The chain reaction explosions began at about 11:45 a.m. -LRB- 5:45 a.m. EST -RRB- among newly constructed homes in <LOCATION> Niederwalluf </LOCATION>, about three miles southwest of <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state Interior Minister <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Niederwalluf </LOCATION> that 4,500 residents were evacuated to neighboring <LOCATION> Eltville </LOCATION> until 500 houses could be checked to make sure no further danger of explosion existed. Officials earlier said the danger appeared over, but at least three more explosions erupted among the white townshouses hours later, raising the total to 20 blasts and 20 homes damaged, <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> said. Officials said four of the homes were demolished. The child's body was found in the rubble of one house. Rescue teams with trained dogs searched other damaged structures for more possible victims.

 Political activists began a hunger strike after they were arrested for organizing a human rights march that police broke up last weekend, the wife of opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> said Thursday. `` My husband was detained in the central police station on Dec. 6 when he went to find out about the imprisonment of other politicians,'' <PERSON> Rafaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Guanes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> said.

 Chinese and American officials on Thursday began three days of scholarly discussions and banquets to mark the 10th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. In the first of many toasts to be raised over the next few days, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> told hundreds of Chinese scholars `` Let us commit ourselves not only to expanding our exchanges of delegations and goods, but also to that ever-elusive, more profound goal _ the exchange of understanding.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> plans a strait-laced dinner and evening of traditional entertainment Friday at the imposing Great Hall of the People. Lord's wife, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, said she is planning a more light-hearted party Saturday that will involve ushers in panda suits. `` It's not going to be a reception, it will be a happening,'' she said. `` We want to have fun.'' Both sides said the state of Chinese-U.S. relations is cause for celebration but acknowledged that friction exists over trade, human rights issues and the status of the rival Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` Ten years ago, nobody could imagine that the two countries would develop the kinds of extensive and permeating contacts that exist today,'' <PERSON> Zi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongyun </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, told a seminar marking the anniversary. For decades after the Communists came to power in 1949, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognized their defeated rivals, the Nationalists on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government. Ideological suspicion was reinforced when the Chinese Communists and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found themselves on opposite sides in the 1950-53 Korean War. In 1972, President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> made a dramatic trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and began a process of drawing closer to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that culminated on Dec. 15, 1978, when President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> signed an accord recognizing the Communist government. The agreement took effect Jan. 1, 1979. Since then, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s second-largest trading partner, after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with 1988 trade projected at more than $ 13.5 billion. More than 50,000 Chinese will travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988, Lord told the seminar Thursday, and about 300,000 Americans will visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hundreds of cultural and scientific exchanges have taken place in addition to regular visits by senior government officials. However, Ms. <PERSON> Zi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains unhappy over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to press <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to enter into reunification talks with the mainland. She also repeated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s frequent charges of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade protectionism and criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of technology transfer `` to impose pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

 A prosecutor ordered a 41-year-old Swede held in custody Thursday in the slaying of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, signaling what could be a major break in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s crime of the century. The man detained Wednesday is suspected of `` having murdered <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON>, spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s strict press and libel law forbids publication of a suspect's name, but he was identified in public records as <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>. Palme, a four-term <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> prime minister who championed international peace and disarmament issues, was killed the night of Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home unguarded with his wife from a downtown movie theater. The killing jolted a nation which prides itself on orderliness and had seen little of the political violence and terrorism that plague other countries. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has a history of violent crime and a previous conviction of manslaughter. He has been interrogated since he was detained Wednesday. `` The suspicions from yesterday remain,'' said <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON>. A witness identified the man as someone who waited outside the Grand Theater, where Palme had been just before he was fatally shot, the radio reported without identifying its source. It said there were discrepancies between witness accounts and the suspect's alibi. The killer followed Palme down the street after the prime minister left the theater and shot him with a .357 magnum revolver which has not been found. Before Wednesday, police were unable to produce a solid lead or a motive in the killing, despite the largest manhunt in Swedish history and a reward of $ 8 million. The investigation was marred by squabbling between police and prosecutors, and the chief detective in the case was replaced twice. Government commissions accused police of incompetence in the investigation. Thursday's move means that prosecutors feel they have enough evidence to build a case against the man and may hold him indefinitely, although his attorney may dispute the remand order in <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` There is reason to believe it will be a difficult case,'' said <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>, the public defender assigned to the case. `` My client denies it, says it's a mistake,'' he said in a television interview. A friend of the suspect said the man was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-rightist group that advocates white supremacy, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported. But police have not linked him with the party, the report said. `` He did n't like <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>, he was angry at him,'' the unidentified friend was quoted as saying. Authorities have refused to give details of their case, but Swedish police reporters were given access to the suspect's file. Reports said he had 63 convictions for various offenses and had spent the last 22 years in and out of prisons and phychiatric wards. He was convicted of fatally stabbing an alleged drug addict with a bayonet in 1970, just a few yards from the site of the Palme killing. <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON> said the suspect had been under investigation `` for a long time,'' but declined to give further details. The man had been questioned in 1986, but was not arrested because his alibi appeared sound at the time, according to TT.

 The two airlines that dominate <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> airport agreed Thursday on flight schedule changes aimed at reducing the number of delays in and out of the airport next spring, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. After two days of meetings, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stagger and more evenly distribute flights at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> _ the busiest airport in the nation _ especially during heavy travel periods in the evening, officials said. `` We're pleased with the adjustments which should provide a substantial reduction in delays we've been experiencing -LRB- at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>. Most of the adjustments will go into effect March 1 when the airlines put their spring schedules into place. The discussions under the direction of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> were being conducted at a hotel near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Flight delays have increased at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> in recent months after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reduced the maximum number of flights allowed each hour at the airport. The flight restrictions were imposed because of concern that air traffic controllers were being asked to handle too many planes. There has been a sharp increase in controller errors involving air traffic in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area this year. American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> together have about 60 percent of the flights at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said the adjustments agreed upon by the two airlines will be closely watched by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> when they go into effect. `` If we find out the agreement is n't working, we'll call the carriers back in again,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Organizers of the one-day general strike that jolted <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to a standstill demanded on Thursday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> give workers and the poor a bigger share of the country's growing prosperity. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that Wednesday's 24-hour strike was `` a victory for all of Spanish society.'' `` The government has to be sensitive to the demands of the union movement,. It should not underestimate what has happened or try to fool itself,'' he said. His union is a century-old ally of <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement Thursday, the prime minister acknowledged `` the political success'' of the strike and admitted it represented `` a tough political blow for the government.'' The unions estimate that 7.8 million of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 11.8 million employed stayed off the job to protest austere economic policies. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the government would give its view of the strike in Parliament next Wednesday and seek a first meeting with union leaders the following day. But government spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> said the government's position `` will not vary substantially. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> joined the communist-dominated Workers Commissions to organize the strike after talks with the government broke down a month ago over demands for more pay, unemployment benefits and pensions. <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON> warned that the two unions will organize more strikes and demonstrations if the government fails to satisfy their demands. <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON> and Secretary-General <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> of the Workers Commissions told reporters the government must accept the unions' basic demands prior to their entering wide-ranging negotiations on economic policies repeatedly offered by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> These include wage and pension demands, expanded unemployment benefits, granting civil servants collective bargaining rights and withdrawing a youth employment plan the unions reject as exploitative. The unions have denounced <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' anti-inflation, high-growth economic policies which caused a boom in the last three years. They complain that the policies failed to reduce unemployment, which at 18.7 percent remains the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON> said it was time to compensate workers and the poor for sacrifices the unions contend made the boom possible.

<HEAD>Department Spends $1.3 Million Sending Collider Reports to the

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department came under criticism Thursday from an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman who said the department wasted $ 1.5 million by mailing a 26-pound, 23-volume report on the superconducting super collider to 16,000 people, sometimes sending four to a family. A department spokesman, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, disputed the figures cited by Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., saying the report actually went to about 17,000 people and cost $ 1.3 million `` This is crazy,'' said <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, whose district includes one of the rejected sites for the collider. `` It's just a lack of common sense.'' The document at issue is an 8,000-page environmental impact statement on possible sites for the $ 4.4 billion atom smasher in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> announced Nov. 10 that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would house the project, a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets which would whip proton beams together with 20 times the force of the most powerful existing atom smasher. Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from studying subatomic particles created by the proton collisions. The department sent copies of the environmental statement to everyone who testified at hearings on the project or submitted written comments on any of the seven finalist sites, <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> said. `` It is government practice that both draft and final documents be made available to interested parties as part of the environmental review process,'' he explained. `` In order to comply with that process, the department mailed that document out.'' However, <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON> said an expensive mailing went far beyond the requirement that agencies keep people involved in the site-selection process. `` The law says people have to be contacted; they do n't have to send all this stuff,'' he said. `` If the department sent a letter with a reply card, maybe they'd get 1 percent that would want the report. Then, just making them available in libraries would be enough. `` Why not do that? We're scrimping to cut spending by pennies, dimes and nickles in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They're spending almost $ 1 -LCB- million, here, when we could be using that money to build highways or feed the homeless. What a waste!'' <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> acknowledged that the mailing might alienate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who will decide whether to appropriate money for the collider. `` I understand where the argument is coming from. I do n't know who made the ultimate decision,'' he said. `` But if we had n't distributed -LRB- the report -RRB-, we would have been criticized for that as well.

<TEXT>
 More than 150 Nicaraguan refugees are living in the locker rooms of a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> stadium after their three-room shelter was closed by the city because it was overcrowded. `` I saw three, four people sleeping on top of each other'' at the House of Love and Hope, said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> after a Tuesday night inspection. `` I was horrified.'' The privately run shelter was shut down Wednesday for alleged unsanitary conditions and violations of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> zoning laws. Vans and buses moved the 157 refugees to the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> stadium. There was no word on how long the refugees would be allowed to stay at the stadium. The action was the first time <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officials have stepped in to handle the growing influx of Nicaraguan refugees, who have been moving to the city since the Sandinista revolution in 1979. The exodus has picked up speed in the past few months with thousands of Nicaraguans pouring across the border, many from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and finding their way to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Some resented the move to the stadium. `` They're moving us like animals,'' said <PERSON> Magda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> two months. Others were pleased with the space and bath facilities at their new quarters. `` I feel they're helping us,'' said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON>. The shelter had been cited for code violations several times since it opened in August, but officials had given shelter founder <PERSON> Cristobal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> extensions to search for better quarters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate 300 Nicaraguans a week have been settling in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> since the summer. The city manager told Nicaraguans that their problem was similar to the problem facing Mariel refugees eight years ago. When 125,000 Mariel refugees arrived in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1980, they were processed in the Orange Bowl and a tent city was erected to house them under an Interstate 95. `` We need to work with you in the same way,'' said <PERSON> Odio </PERSON>, who helped direct the Mariel relief effort.

 Top Energy Department officials will meet here with the governors of three western states Friday in an attempt to resolve an impasse over storage of radioactive wastes from nuclear weapons plants. The governors of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said they want to hear proposals to solve the problem when they meet with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, chief deputy to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, and other regional DOE officials. The immediate problem is to find a storage site for seven boxcars of radioactive material _ and enough additional waste to fill 17 more _ sitting outside the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flats </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The other question is when the federal government will open its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a prototype for permanent waste storage facilities under construction in southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmet </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Thursday the purpose of the meeting was to provide `` a chance for some straight talk between the governors and the federal government.'' But the governors said they hope federal officials will have an answer to the problem. `` I've got all the information I need. What I need now is for them to come and say, ` We have got our act together,''' Idaho Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said at a Thursday news conference. `` They should come with a proposal that the three governors can deal with.'' Waste has been stacking up at Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium components for nuclear weapons, since October when <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> turned away a boxcar headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and said the state would accept no more shipments. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said he would not open the laboaratory to additional shipments until the pilot plant is opened and <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> has outlined a plan to remove existing waste from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Since the ban was imposed, he said, `` There has been no progress for two months, which tells me I was right to put my foot down.'' Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he would require Rocky Flats to suspend production once its temporary storage capacity is filled. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said during a news conference Thursday that he would not consider a 90-day extension that would permit <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> to keep waste beyond the plant's capacity. `` If they do n't have a solution, they are going to have to close it by failing to act,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` I do not want a de facto dump here. That's why I've kept that storage in those boxcars.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he did not expect an immediate solution to the Rocky Flats problem, but said he hoped the DOE would `` put some alternate solutions on the table.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Caviness </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, said his boss wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to provide a firm deadline for opening the pilot plant and an update on the progress of some $ 240 million in mitigation funds the state has been promised. Under an agreement signed between the state and <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is to receive $ 190 million to build bypasses around major cities through which waste would be shipped, and $ 50 million to compensate for lost mining royalties. <PERSON> Caviness </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> would not permit the pilot plant to open until those pledges are fulfilled. `` The DOE is in the awkward position. The governor is not going to have the WIPP site open until the terms are met. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has no intention of rolling over because the governors of other states have problems,'' said <PERSON> Caviness </PERSON>.

 The trial of a man and a woman accused of bilking 31,000 men out of $ 4.5 million with phony stories of a retreat inhabited by nude `` love angels'' went to a jury Thursday.

 A $ 200 million drop in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> investment funds are actual dollar losses, not interest, and resulted from poor sales, state treasury officials said Thursday. As jittery local governments continued to pull their money from the state investment pool, treasury officials said they sold off $ 30 million worth of securities early to satisfy a run on the investment account. In addition, Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said the man in charge of investments at the time of the 1987 loss _ former Associate Treasurer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> _ was warned by his staff about the bad investments but did nothing to halt them. The loss was not revealed until this week, and the news has spurred a four-day run by local and county governments on the state's consolidated investment fund, in which state agencies and local governments place money for investment by the state. The local governments pulled out another $ 37 million Thursday, bringing to $ 146 million the investment fund withdrawals since Monday _ about half of what the agencies had invested. Assistant Treasurer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Capet </PERSON> said $ 30 million worth of securities was sold at a loss to raise the funds needed to pay the local governments. The state also sold other matured securities and all its interest earnings were used to meet the demand. `` It's a day to day thing,'' <PERSON> Capet </PERSON> said. `` From the newspaper reports that I've seen and the lack of an explanation from those in charge, our money would be at risk in the account if we were to wait for an explanation,'' said <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administrator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>, whose county commission Thursday withdrew the $ 1.6 million it had in the investment fund. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, who is in charge of the investment fund, said he suspects no wrongdoing in the loss. `` It was just bad investments,'' he said Thursday. The treasurer has asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and state officials to investigate the loss, however. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> directed <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s request to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which has not decided whether to investigate. At <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s request, the private accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the loss. <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>, who submitted his resignation last month to join the staff of Gov.-elect <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> as chief financial adviser, has said he is awaiting the results of the Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> investigation before commenting. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> has refused to accept <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>'s resignation until the matter is cleared up. He has challenged <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> to reveal publicly what happened, since <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> said he has explained the situation to <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. `` He was the man directly responsible,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> explained it to <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, why does n't he explain it to the people? This is strange silence. He's hiding behind the governor-elect.'' But <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> as saying that he notified <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> as soon as he discovered the losses. The governor-elect said he retains the `` fullest confidence'' in <LOCATION> Margolin </LOCATION>. Assistant Treasurer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Capet </PERSON> said the bad investments were made over a 6 - to 8-month period He said the assets were purchased at a high price and sold at a lower price. Former Assistant Treasurer <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, who actually made the investments under <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON>, was quoted in The <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday as saying that she was retaining a lawyer and would have no comment. Assistant Treasurer <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who now is in charge of investments, said the consolidated investment fund this week totaled $ 1.572 billion, or $ 208 million less than last December. The fund was $ 2.4 billion at the end of 1986.

 A postal worker who shot and wounded three people and held his girlfriend hostage for almost 13 hours was coaxed into surrendering Thursday by an old acquaintance _ the police chief. `` I just tried to appeal to him as a father,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said. `` I'm glad it worked. I'm not a trained hostage negotiator.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 39, gave himself up in the main <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> post office shortly after 9 a.m. and released his hostage, 29-year-old <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, unharmed, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Menchel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was booked with assault with intent to commit murder, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Africk </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Michaelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a federal lockup in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Three post office workers hit by birdshot from <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s gun during the siege, which began about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, were not seriously wounded, officials said. <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON>, who negotiated with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> for about two hours, said he knew the gunman because their sons had played football together. He said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was concerned about a marital breakup and the welfare of his children who reportedly were in his estranged wife's custody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, also a postal employee, as <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s girlfriend. `` He was n't angry at her,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. `` He was upset over a family matter. After the shooting started, he just grabbed her.'' <PERSON> Volney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, after arriving for work Wednesday evening, pulled a birdshot-loaded shotgun out of a bag and started shooting. He hit one person in the eye, another in the thigh and another in the arm. Postal employee <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, hit in the eye, was reported in good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Another victim who was unidentified was in fair condition at <LOCATION> Tulane </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. At <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman said a third victim, also unidentified, was discharged Thursday. About 400 postal workers and customers fled when the shooting broke out, authorities said. About 100 others took cover and hid for four hours before being escorted out by officers making a room-by-room search for the gunman. When the shooting began, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was standing in line with his Christmas cards. `` I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' <PERSON> Wingerter </PERSON> said. `` Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.'' After eluding police for five hours, the gunman was cornered with his hostage in a windowless coffee break room with a single door. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> chased off agents with gunfire. More gunfire erupted sporadically through the night when <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> apparently became frustrated, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. No one was hurt, he said. `` They were just random shots,'' he said. `` They have n't been at anyone. ... just stick the barrel under the door and fire.'' Once it was apparent there was no danger to people outside the building, police lifted roadblocks around the building, allowing rush hour traffic to proceed on the busy streets surrounding the post office. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> made his only demand about 9 a.m., telling negotiators he wanted to see no news reporters. A few minutes later, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> surrendered. `` I told him I'd meet him halfway, and when he walked out I was there,'' <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said. `` He had thrown the shotgun out.'' Postal inspector <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Durken </PERSON> said he did n't know how <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> got the gun into the post office. `` Most of our entrances are secured,'' said <PERSON> Durken </PERSON>. `` But it's a big building. The loading docks are open at times. Unless you had someone every 20 feet, it would be hard to make sure nothing ever got through.''

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will name onetime rival Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as secretary of housing and urban development and was poised to make a decision on former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary, sources said Thursday. Sources close to both <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and the vice president said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had accepted the job after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday and that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> announcement could come either Friday or Monday. Meanwhile, Tower was tentatively set to talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday. A final <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check on the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was presented to the vice president on Thursday. Transition officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the lengthy background check did not uncover any problems that would hurt Tower's chances for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 53, a former professional football quarterback who has championed conservative causes, was a distant also-ran in the Republican primaries last winter. He was an original sponsor of the 1981 tax cut legislation later endorsed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and is an ardent advocate of free enterprise and government deregulation. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has called for housing vouchers for the poor and allowing tenants of public housing to purchase their units at low cost as part of his urban redevelopment proposals. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved closer to filling two other Cabinet appointments, transition sources said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a black medical school chief and contender for secretary of health and human services, and was on the verge of naming <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as secretary of transportation, according to the sources. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDougal </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> business executive and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition adviser, also has emerged as a top candidate for secretary of labor, sources said. The sources, who commented only on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may fill some of the eight remaining vacancies in his Cabinet on Friday. He has filled six Cabinet departments so far and has said he wants to finish before Christmas. Transition legal counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> delivered his final background report on Tower to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has delayed a decision on whether to name <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, 63, <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary pending completion of an extensive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's background, including an acrimonious divorce. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is not the only black reportedly under consideration for the Bush Cabinet, which already includes a Hispanic, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, the holdover secretary of education. Retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who now runs the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is in the running to head the new Department of Veterans Affairs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters only that he had a `` very good'' meeting with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Transition sources said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 55, president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the meeting that he shared the vice president's anti-abortion views. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> are friends. He accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1982, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> board of trustees. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> introduced the future first lady at the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last August. Although transition officials formally said there was no final decision on the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> post, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a practice of meeting with his prospective Cabinet choice shortly before an announcement. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 50, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that he expects to name a black to his Cabinet. At a photo opportunity before meeting with transition advisers and talent scouts, the vice president brushed aside a question about whether he may appoint two blacks to the Cabinet. `` Do n't believe all the rumors that are around. Just wait to have an announcement,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who also told reporters that after the transition, he wo n't allow questions at picture-taking sessions. `` Talking at photo ops will continue until Jan. 20 and after that there will be absolutely none,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And then I'll have other ways of communicating that will be much more pleasant for you and much more pleasant for me and much more respectful of our guests like foreign visitors.'' He said the current practice of trying to sandwich in questions during picture-taking sessions was `` demeaning to your profession.'' <PERSON> MacDougal </PERSON>, 52, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is reportedly among four candidates on a short list for the labor job, along with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> labor lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilberg </PERSON>; <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, has faded as a top contender, administration sources said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the transition lawyer, said background checks now are under way on candidates for subcabinet jobs. As for Tower, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would ask him to pursue further any aspect of the extensive checking already completed. One of the leading proponents of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, retired Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, said Thursday he opposes a Tower nomination because the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman `` is not for SDI.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group for the space-based missile shield, said Tower would be `` in the pocket of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>'' and would sacrifice SDI to preserve weapons in the Pentagon arsenal. He predicted Tower would not get the job `` mainly because he's carrying so much baggage around on his back.''

 Palestinians, the Arab world generally and many other countries said Thursday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> may bring new life to stagnant <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace negotiations. `` I could scream and cry and say, ` Happy new peaceful era, Arabs and Israelis!''' said <PERSON> Nawal </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON>, 44, a pharmacist whose family fled Israeli-held <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON>, one of 1.5 million Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, wept as she said: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has to know that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, and especially Palestinians, are for peace and the wise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision does not mean <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will be thrown into the sea. ... We want to live in peace and share the same land.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, a former Palestinian mayor who was expelled from the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said Wednesday's announcement was `` a great step by a great nation.'' `` One of the major roadblocks has now been removed to convening an international conference and the peaceful co-existence between all peoples and all religions and all states,'' <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling executive committee, said in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. Some radical factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also hailed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision. <PERSON> Kays </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Samarai </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a new victory for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'' and for the intefadeh _ the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, leader of the radical Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, called it a victory for the uprising even though `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration says that initiating the dialogue does not entail recognition of Palestinian rights to ... an independent state.'' Palestinians declared an independent state last month. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s statement referred to `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' instead of `` the Zionist entity,'' the phrase his group and other factions traditionally have used to describe the Jewish state. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said it was `` sad day for all of us.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the move was `` just another step'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not worry about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to its security. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, delighted Palestinans marched in the streets to celebrate. Some Palestinians opposed the concessions made by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, such as renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, which effectively denies many Palestinians the dream of returning someday to their homes `` Armed struggle is our only option. Palestine is for the Palestinian people and not for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>, a 22-year-old student at the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> praised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision and predicted it will lead to an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said the decision was a beginning, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must withdraw from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and allow establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. He accused Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes an international conference, of delaying peace efforts. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahram </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement came hours after <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> telephoned Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` to urge him to take a positive attitude toward the constructive decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, after meeting with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, and said: `` I believe the ice has been broken. ... I believe the peace process has begun, and we hope to see it accelerate in the near future.'' Later, in a satellite TV interview with `` CBS Evening News,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Americans `` should understand that the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and their representatives have opted for peace ... I know <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to be a man who is determined to stand by his word -LRB- in renouncing terrorism -RRB- ... That's good enough for me.'' <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Musamer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, noted that the Americans said the talks would start at a low level, but added: `` We hope it will be more than that after the first meeting and especially under the new American president.'' In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent statements qualified the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to take part in a peace conference. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said later in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> interview, `` There has been courage and clarity from the Palestinian side. We must now look for the same kind of response from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said the decision `` has brought peace in the region a step closer.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> declaration as `` an important step toward progress.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, who was visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, concurred, and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> radio called the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> decision a sign that `` the force of reason begins to prevail.'' The governments of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were among those praising the action. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said it would send a delegation of senior diplomats to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> urged member nations to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a Palestinian government-in-exile. An-Nidaa, a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily, carried the headline: `` American Retreat Under Blows of Stone-Throwing Heroes.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s official news agency used the headline `` Finally, American-Palestinian dialogue.'' In an <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> refugee camp, accountant <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalidy </PERSON> said: `` I never expected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would look at us or care to find a solution to the Palestinian issue.''

 Howling winds clocked at up to 102 mph battered <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday, claiming at least one life, overturning trucks, toppling trees and cutting power to more than 440,000 electric customers. The winds littered scenic <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with downed power lines, branches and trash, and authorities closed dangerous highways and issued travel warnings. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> waterfront was ravaged by the winds, which tore yachts adrift, sank several and sent waves up to 10 feet high slamming into seawalls. A 60-foot floating dock at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Pier 43 sank `` We've had lots of trees knocked down, power outages and phone problems,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sonoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Some homes have been damaged to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up in motels overnight.'' Three-year-old <PERSON> Oli </PERSON> <PERSON> Asghar </PERSON> died Thursday in a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> apartment fire sparked by a candle used because of a wind-caused power outage. His parents and three brothers and sisters were left homeless, fire officials said. Some 442,000 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers throughout <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were left in the dark by the winds, said officials for the utility whose repair crews worked through the night. `` This is definitely ... one of the largest outages because of the velocity of the winds,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutkowski </PERSON>. The winds also delayed the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vinson </ORGANIZATION> from reaching its dock in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The carrier was scheduled to arrive Thursday following a six-month tour, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials postponed the homecoming until Friday. Winds were n't the only weather problem in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Driving snow Thursday afternoon forced the closure of Highway 101 from <PERSON> Paso </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, a 30-mile stretch about 230 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The winds were caused by the strong flow of air from a high pressure system over British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to a low pressure center in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>. In northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the same `` upper air'' weather system brought gusting winds up to 115 mph to northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, said meteorologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alder </PERSON>. Winds there felled power lines, toppled tractor-trailer trucks, delayed mail deliveries, closed schools and fanned several brush fires early Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> crews worked into the afternoon to restore electricity at the sites of scattered outages throughout a four-county area. UP & amp; L spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said he had no firm estimate on the number of people left without electricity, but said `` you certainly would be safe saying several thousand.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, power lines strewn across heavily traveled <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, forced authorities to close it overnight. Two private planes at the <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> airport apparently were damaged by the winds, said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>. About 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel aboard the USS <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON>, returning from a six-month deployment to the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, had their holiday port call delayed several hours because of the winds. Petty Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwinn </PERSON>, aboard the huge ship, said he was eager to reach shore where his wife, <PERSON> Sheree </PERSON>, and 3-month-old son, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, were waiting. `` For me, it's hard. I've never seen my kid,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Panel Recommends Temporary Halt to `Let It Burn' Policy for
Forests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal panel on Thursday recommended a temporary halt to the `` let it burn'' policy in national parks and wilderness areas to make sure everybody understands what the policy means. In a report to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, the advisory panel said current policies permitting fires to burn under predetermined conditions `` are sound, but the policies themselves need to be refined, strengthened and reaffirmed.'' Until the moratorium is lifted, fires will be put out, officials said. `` No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management plans meet these standards,'' the report said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Philpot </PERSON>, co-chairman of the review panel, told reporters he expected `` the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the Western fire season, which is the middle of May.'' <PERSON> Philpot </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official who is now special assistant to the deputy secretary of agriculture. The secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> appointed the committee in September after the worst fire season in history in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Yellowstone National Park. Some 249 fires in and near the park prompted complaints from residents and their representatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that their communities were being ruined by smoke and the collapse of tourism. The panel reviewed fire management policy on all federal lands, not just <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. The panel said it found that some plans did not spell out the conditions under which natural fires would be allowed to burn. Some plans also did not consider `` values at risk outside of parks and wilderness and the number of fires that can be managed at one time,'' and `` cumulative effects of drought.'' The panel's other co-chairman, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that `` Twenty-five to 30 percent of the plans have some shortcomings. Some of them are minor.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contains the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contains the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises many wilderness areas and manages much national forest land adjacent to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Interior's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> also manage affected lands. The agencies insist they do n't have `` let it burn'' policies but rather `` let it burn if it meets our criteria'' policies. The report said the agencies reject as `` impractical and unprofessional'' the practice that fires can be allowed to burn free of conditions laid down in advance or appropriate suppression action. It said some employees essentially had advocated that policy as long as fire did n't escape the agency's land. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and Agriculture agencies should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency had had the report for 24 hours, and would be submitting comments to the two secretaries. `` I do n't see it as a major shift,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said. `` It's clear we'll do more around developed areas'' in deliberately set fires to clear firebreaks or other techniques. The report, which will remain open for public comment for 60 days, recommended more research on when deliberately set fires can be used and how to use them in lodgepole pine forests, the dominant kind in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Many people interviewed said this technique should be available for all federal land, though it has been little used in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and practically never in lodgepole because of the difficulty of controlling it. The fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> were particularly intense because of more than a century's buildup of dead trees and other matter on the forest floor. `` There is little agreement on whether management objectives can be achieved through planned ignitions when they result in high intensity crown fire,'' the report said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Linenesch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he saw no reason why all parks should be barred from letting fires burn until every management plan had been approved. `` The lesson of the summer is that you can not choreograph nature,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of the association.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who once was held hostage by Palestinians, telephoned <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Thursday to make the first official contact of a new dialogue for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, who escaped from his terrorist captors in 1970, held a brief conversation with a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official at their <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> headquarters, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> did not identify the Palestinian or say what was discussed. He said he did not know when to expect the first face-to-face meeting of what Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> calls a `` substantive dialogue.'' Palestinian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation at the first meeting probably will be led by executive committee members <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hourani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the talks probably would begin Friday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other officials in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Thursday, then headed to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was one of the first countries to recognize an independent Palestinian state. It was not known when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> intended to return to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent statements renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist opened the way for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He designated <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's `` only authorized channel of communication.'' `` We hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct negotiations that will lead to peace,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` How those negotiations are structured, who is there to speak on behalf of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> is a subject that's a difficult one.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and especially <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states as the sole legitimate representative of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, has its political headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, capital of the Arab nation of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> political director, confirmed by telephone that the conversation with <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> `` really took place.'' But he declined to identify the official who spoke to the ambassador. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> called the director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> political section to try to arrange talks. It was not clear whether he was referring to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON>. `` We're sure the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will try hard to have them take place as soon as possible,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another official said the first meeting certainly would come within days. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, who has been ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> since March 1987, is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable American diplomats on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs. The 53-year-old native of <LOCATION> Patchogue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, speaks Arabic and French and has served in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He once was ambassador to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. From 1985 until going to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> was deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. His first encounter with Palestinian terrorism came in September 1970 when guerrillas of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s extremist <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction diverted three airliners to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, and took the passengers and crews hostage. Colleagues say <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> enjoys describing how he outwitted captors who kidnapped him on the streets of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> and took him with the other hostages to a a downtown hotel news conference. Seeing his captors were not attentive, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> edged in among the journalists. `` He was standing there as the press conference was going on and he just walked away. He bears them no ill will. It was a great adventure,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said on condition of anonymity. `` Those were in the innocent days,'' he recalled. `` It's almost hard to remember the days when you just did n't kill diplomats.''

<TEXT>
 The house of the second-ranking official in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was attacked with grenades last month, the embassy reported Thursday. Neither <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON>, the deputy chief of mission, nor any of his family members or domestic employees was injured in the Nov. 25 nighttime attack. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that men traveling in two cars through the affluent neighborhood of <PERSON> Maquilishuat </PERSON> threw several grenades and that two landed at the wall surrounding <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON>'s house. <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said the two grenades caused some material damage, but no injuries. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the explosives bounced off the top of the wall into the yard. A woman was wounded by shrapnel from another grenade thrown farther down the road, according to newspaper reports published in the days after the attack. Those reports did not mention the attack on <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON>'s home. No group claimed responsibility for the Maquilishuat attack. Because other grenades were thrown at other homes, it was unclear if the attackers considered <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON>'s house their specific target. Four days after the attack, leftist guerrillas briefly took over two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> radio stations to broadcast a statement saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buildings were considered `` legitimate targets'' in the 9-year-old civil war. The centrist government's war effort is funded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The guerrillas, on their clandestine radio station, previously made similar statements. The wall around the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade in October.

 Israeli leaders responded with anger and dismay Thursday to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> declaration that it will talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a stunning reversal of policy to which they were given no time to object. Some Israelis were left with a sense of betrayal by the way the announcement was handled. Others said the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is doomed to collapse. `` We believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will discover very soon the true face of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and will realize that it can not be a partner for negotiations and peace,'' said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. According to the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was considering a unilateral Israeli step `` that will make the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision fade.'' The initiative amounted to granting a limited self-rule to 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands, <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page report in its Friday editions. The daily Hadashot described <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision as `` the most painful diplomatic slap in the face that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has received since its establishment. We have been left alone to face the entire world.'' Israeli officials said they were notified only 30 minutes before Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made the announcement, which allowed no time for an attempt to dissuade the Americans. Analysts said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will face mounting pressure for a favorable response to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and delay could endanger relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which is its main ally and provides $ 3 billion a year in aid. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> succeed, pressure would grow for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept a U.N.-sponsored peace conference, which many Israelis see as a forum for demanding unreasonable concessions from the Jewish state. A conference probably would consider such issues as the Israeli settlements that dot the occupied territories, return of the territories, the status of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the central question of an independent Palestinian state. An example of what <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers unreasonable was a provision in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution passed Thursday for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has declared its capital. Such right-wing leaders as <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was prepared to take the heat. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but this does n't require us to speak with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> said `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can advise us and even pressure us here and there, but we have to know how to withstand the pressures.'' Palestinians called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision a victory of their year-old uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, in which more than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, a senior aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, told foreign reporters there could be no solutions to Palestinian problems without <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` They are still where they were in the camps,'' he said. `` We are still running the show. Their lot ... has not changed by this American move. The agent to bring about change is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and nothing can be done by bypassing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sent an explanatory message to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s caretaker government. A text released by Israeli officials said: `` I know how sensitive an issue this is for you and the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The dialogue that is about to be launched is not an end in itself. It must focus on the core issue of negotiations to end the <LOCATION> Arafat-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> passed on oral assurances that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not recognizing <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims to an independent state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio called <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talk with <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> `` a hard and unpleasant one.'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are `` stronger than ever,'' but he said Israelis and Palestinians must make difficult concessions for peace. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, made no comment Thursday, but <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said: `` We regret this <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> decision, very much.'' He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not reconsider its refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it calls a terrorist organization. Dozens of Jewish settlers from the territories began a hunger strike, pitching tents in front of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the seed of the next war,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, a settler leader. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not reach agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. There is no common ground and the result will be an explosion.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political rival, said of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism: `` I surely see a change in their rhetoric; I hardly see a change in their actions This is the discrepancy that worries me.'' He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was `` facing a new situation'' and proposed an alternative: that elections be held in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders for peace negotiations. <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a Labor member of the Cabinet without portfolio, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism made the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a satisfactory partner for talks. `` I think a new era has opened,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Laws Would Ban Religious Discrimination In Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government proposed new laws Thursday to prevent employers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> from discriminating on the basis of religion, but said threats of disinvestment could only produce greater misery. `` I have made absolutely clear ... that there is to be no discrimination of any sort in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top official in the province. The bill, whose passage is assured because of the governing Conservatives' huge majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, would force companies to report regularly on how many Catholics and Protestants they employ. It would order them if necessary to change their employment practices and levy fines of up to $ 55,000 on employers who do n't. The measures, due to take effect next summer, stopped short of imposing hiring quotas for the 40 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority, but they mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. Despite longtime bans on overt religious discrimination in jobs, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> unemployment runs at 17 percent, 2 -LCB- times the Protestant rate. The new moves appear to have been spurred partly by threats of disinvestment from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Eight American states have endorsed fair employment principles put forward in 1984 by the late Irish statesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> MacBride </PERSON>. He called for ending investment in companies in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> accused of religious bias. The disinvestment lobby is headed by Irish-American legislators and pressure groups. American investment accounts for nearly 14 percent of the jobs in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` There is absolutely no way in which this legislation is designed to see Protestants being dismissed for Catholics to take their place,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> told reporters. `` This is about recruitment ... seeing that there is equality of opportunity.'' He said the only way to improve employment opportunities for Catholics was to create more jobs, and he called the disinvestment program in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a very negative campaign.'' `` We're getting more jobs into <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and that combined with effective legislation is the real hope for Catholics of a fairer situation,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` There is no hope for Catholics in any policy that leads to disinvestment in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which leads to greater misery for all.'' More than 2,700 people have been killed since political and sectarian violence broke out in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969 after several years of civil rights campaigning by <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>. Under the new laws, all companies with more than 25 employees _ and later with 10 or more _ will have to submit reports at least once every three years on the religious composition of the work force to a new body, the Fair Employment Commission. Failure to submit a report or comply with the commission will be a criminal offense, carrying a fine of up to $ 55,000. The laws would also ban `` indirect discrimination'' in hiring practices, such as getting workers to find new workers or taking recruits from a single school. Nearly all Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> children are educated separately. Public and private companies with more than 250 employees also will have to monitor their job applications as well as the composition of their work force.

 A man imprisoned 20 years ago in the poisoning deaths of his seven children asked for a new trial Thursday, telling the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> he was framed. Attorneys for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the prosecutors and the sheriff involved in his conviction time should be charged with perjury and perhaps attempted murder, because he once faced execution in the electric chair. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s case also is being reviewed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was considering a request to recommend clemency to free the former orange picker from prison. Three Cabinet members would have to concur. `` This petition is going to crumble the house of cards the state's case was built on,'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said shortly before filing the petition. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, and lawyer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who wrote a book on the <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> murders, said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was framed partly to protect a friend of then-Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. The friend was related to <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Richardsons </PERSON>' baby sitter who <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> say has confessed to the killings. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> fed the children on the day of Oct. 25, 1968, when <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> were working in the fields. The children, ranging in age from 2 to 8, died within a day after eating food laced with the deadly pesticide parathion. The lawyers said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, convicted on one count of first-degree murder, was an easy target because he was illiterate, poor and black. `` We know what racism was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1968 because of this case. Let's find out what it is in 19 and 88. This case is going to do it,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. They based their petition on three claims: _ The knowing use of perjury from the sheriff regarding an insurance policy <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> supposedly purchased for the seven children, and from two former cellmates of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s who said he had confessed to the crime One has since recanted that statement. _ Prosecutors suppressed evidence that would have shown <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> had not yet purchased the insurance on the children _ Newly discovered evidence; former <ORGANIZATION> Arcadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> says he believes <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was framed by the sheriff, and affidavits from nursing assistants that <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> has told them she fed the poison to the children <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> did not return a telephone message left at his home. There was no answer Thursday night at the office of State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, who won <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s conviction in 1968. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> leaves office next month.

<HEAD>Communist Party Supports Multi-Party System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling communist party for the first time openly supported development of a multi-party system Thursday and said independent political groups can take part in parliamentary elections in 1990. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, chief ideologist of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' -LRB- communist -RRB- Party, said in a report to the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that a law regulating parties should be passed before a new constitution is adopted in early 1990. `` The party ... advocates society's right to self-organization, and therefore it supports the enactment of a party law that will regulate the foundation of parties in keeping with the new constitution,'' <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said in his speech, published by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. It was the party's first direct support of a multi-party system. In November the government approved for presentation to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> draft bills to permit such a system. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> did not say what kind of power new parties will be permitted to wield. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> has said the leading role of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will remain at least until the new constitution is adopted. The keynote address by <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> comes a week before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is to pass a law on assembly and association that sparked a nationwide debate in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on the feasibility of a multi-party system. However, <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> rejected a multi-party system along a Western democratic model. `` We disagree with the bourgeois -LRB- Western -RRB- interpretation of the multi-party system,'' he said. Communists have also said they do not want to see the development of parties like those in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which carry little or no political weight. They say parties that develop should be capable of bearing responsibility. The country's leaders have said the law would mean the acceptance in principle of a multi-party system but have emphasized that a separate law would be needed to regulate the establishment and function of independent political parties. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said the draft constitution could be put before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as early as May or June 1989 and then presented to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in the spring of 1990 following public debate on the draft. He also advocated a plebiscite on the new constitution as demanded by independent groups and some lawmakers after it is approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Elections could then be held in the second half of 1990, <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> was quoted as saying. In an interview with the independent Reform weekly, published Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> indicated independent parties could begin to function on a local level as early as 1989. Dozens of independent organizations have mushroomed in the past year, many with highly political platforms and nationwide support.

 Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen infiltrated a U.N.-policed village in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Thursday and abducted a Shiite Moslem guerrilla leader, police said. Armed residents in the village of <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> retaliated by kidnapping three Irish soldiers with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers for about an hour, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The Irish soldiers were released after the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia promised the villagers that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will do its best to locate the guerrilla leader, <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON>, and bring him back, the spokesman said. A source at the 5,800-strong <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> said villagers from <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> held three <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> soldiers aboard an armored personnel carrier for more than an hour. `` The Amal movement interfered and the villagers released the three Irish soldiers unharmed,'' the source said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, 13 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, is within <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s area of operations The police source said two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and three men from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia `` infiltrated into <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> in two civilian cars early in the day and kidnapped <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON>.''

Israeli troops and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen control a six-to-10-mile strip of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> which they refer to as their `` security zone.'' The zone, which extends from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in the west to the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in the east, serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla raids into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The interior minister and three other Cabinet members were relieved of their jobs on Thursday at a session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The report gave no reason for the shake-up, which came one day after a Communist Party plenum and a series of changes in the ruling Politburo. However, <PERSON> Dimiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoyanov </PERSON> apparently left the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> so he could assume even greater responsibility. <PERSON> Stoyanov </PERSON>, 60, who holds the rank of colonel general, was appointed a full Politburo member and a party secretary _ apparently responsible for security affairs _ at the two-day party conference which ended Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said he was relieved of the interior minister's job he held since 1973. <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON>, 45, named minister of transportation in September, became new interior minister. <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON>, a civilian, has been a member of the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since 1981. Western analysts, speaking on the condition of anonymity, speculated that <PERSON> Stoyanov </PERSON>'s rise to the Politburo was linked to official criticism of growing lawlessness and a wave of criminal offenses in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Replacing <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> as transortation minister was <PERSON> Trifon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashov </PERSON>, a regional party secretary for <LOCATION> Mihailovgrad </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Among other changes in the 14-member Cabinet, Health Minister <PERSON> Radoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Popivanov </PERSON> was replaced by <PERSON> Mincho </PERSON> <PERSON> Peichev </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-ruled mass organization. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, the minister of agriculture and forestry, was replaced by <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menov </PERSON>, a member of the standing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The official media has recently been criticizing the country's agriculture for output shortfalls, including shortages of such basic foodstuffs as potatoes, beans and rice In a speech to the party meeting Tuesday, national Communist leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> called for a reassessment of economic reforms. He said change so far has been inefficient and contradictory. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 76, the longest-serving leader in the Soviet bloc, called for introduction of market-style competition in the economy, partly by turning state enterprises into share companies. He made clear, however, that the state would maintain a controlling role.

 The piercing sounds blasted at a family's farm during a 13-day police siege were demonstrated Thursday at the trial of three polygamist clan members charged with a law officer's Jurors showed little reaction as noises used in the psychological assault ranging from an air-raid type siren to a sound resembling a stuck car horn were played from two 100-watt speakers about 60 yards away from the Summit County Courthouse. The demonstration came in the ninth day of the trial of clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and brother-in-law <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. All are charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 28 death of Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. House was shot and killed as he directed attack dogs toward the Swapp brothers during an arrest attempt. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who precipitated the standoff when he bombed a Mormon chapel in nearby <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> on Jan. 16, was seriously wounded during the same shootout. Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> cautioned jurors that the demonstration was only to illustrate methods used to rob clan members of sleep in hopes of speeding their surrender, and that they were not exact duplications. Defense attorneys have contended that loud, piercing electronic noises, low-flying aircraft, flares and banks of brilliant lights used by authorities in an effort to exhaust the 15 barricaded clan members, including nine children, actually escalated tensions during the siege. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a psychologist called by the defense, testified that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s use of the loudspeaker may have caused anxiety, stress, irritability and reduced reasoning ability among clan members during the standoff. Earlier testimony indicated the loudspeakers were used irregularly during the final days of the standoff, and that they were repeatedly shot out or torn down by clan members. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said the noises were a torture and they put pillows on the children's heads in an attempt to block the sound. He said he was compelled to shoot out or tear down the speakers to stop `` the crazy noise from hell.'' Also on Wednesday, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> testified that neither he nor any other member of his family deliberately fired at officers during the firefight that ended the siege by 100 law officers. He said once the siege began, none of the family felt they could trust anything the authorities said. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said he never fired at anyone during the siege and felt of killing, `` it's murder, it's wrong.'' Asked who should atone for the slaying, he said, `` that was an accident.'' Prosecutors contend and defense attorneys concede the wheelchair-bound Singer fired the fatal bullet, but Singer says he was aiming at the dogs, not House. In a related development, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a friend of the Swapps, was issued a misdemeanor citation charging her with illegally carrying a concealed weapon after she unwittingly brought a gun to the proceedings, officers said. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 36, had handed her purse to a deputy stationed at a metal detector and told him the gun was inside. She later explained to officers that she had left her purse in her car during the morning session and had retrieved it after lunch, forgetting that the weapon was inside, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> barred Foster from the courtroom for the remainder of the trial, and she was ordered to appear Tuesday in 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. The incident went virtually unnoticed in the courtroom.

 An offshore oil rig being towed across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> capsized in high winds Thursday but all 26 crew members were safe inside an enclosed boat called a `` survival pod,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported. The rig <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorilla </PERSON> I capsized about 1,200 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in gale-force winds of 40 to 60 knots and 40-foot seas, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The tugboat Smit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which had been towing the rig from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, remained with the pod, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two commercial vessels were heading toward the tug and pod. They were about 200 miles away as of 4 p.m. and it was expected to take two days to get the crew out of the pod because of weather conditions, he said. A Canadian P-3 plane was on the scene, he said. `` The people are safe _ there's nothing that can be done until the seas subside,'' <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. The crew members entered the survival pod, a boat that is completely enclosed and contains food and water, about noon when it became apparent the rig might capsize, he said. Nobody was injured when the rig capsized sometime in the early afternoon, he said. The rig, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Rowan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, capsized but did not sink, and will probably be salvaged, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said The crew consists of 25 Canadians and one American, he said. But Maj. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>, a spokesman for search and rescue operations in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, said 27 people were in the pod, including two women. He said they were 25 Canadians, one American and one Dutch crew member. `` Apparently they're a little bit seasick, but aside from that we have n't had any other adverse reports,'' he said. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownlow </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> crew member who had been scheduled to meet the rig in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said the life pod has enough food and water for days and can stay afloat in the roughest weather. `` Have you ever put a cork in a bathtub? That's what it's like,'' said <PERSON> Brownlow </PERSON>, who has worked on oil rigs for eight years. `` They're a self-righting capsule They can flip, flip, flip and it will keep righting itself. `` There will be some sick puppies tonight.'' The rig began listing after one of its ballast tanks cracked and began taking in water, said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> McNease </PERSON>, vice president of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Rowan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said the rig, about 300 feet wide and 300 feet long, was built to withstand 100-foot waves and 80 mph winds. The rig, which is not under lease to an oil company, left <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> last week for the 30-day trip across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It can carry 86 men. It is a jack-up rig, meaning its platform sits atop huge legs that are embedded in the sea floor during drilling.

<TEXT>
 A fonmer deacon of a faith-healing sect was sentenced to 41 months in prison Thursday for failing to seek medical help for his dying, diabetic son. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 43, who was convicted in October of first-degree manslaughter in the death of his son, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, was a deacon in a nameless Christian fellowship that followed a literal translation of the Bible, distrusted conventional medicine, and practiced strict discipline of members. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 10, died of complications related to juvenile diabetes at his parent's <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION> home Dec. 20, 1987, the day after he was spanked by his father and church founder <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> during a faith-healing session. `` In 15 years as a judge, nothing has bothered me more than this trial, this sentencing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> said before handing down the sentence to a grim-faced <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>. In brief remarks prior to sentencing, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> he loved his son and asked for mercy so that he could remain with his shattered family, especially an 8-year-old son who is in counseling. During an hour-long plea for leniency, defense attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was under the influence of <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> pastor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. Drawing parallels to the followers of the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> who committed mass suicide in <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> argued that normally intelligent people can be seduced by evil people who subvert <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s word to carry out their will <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> that as a parent, `` I have to be the person that intervenes between the child ... and outside impediments. You had the absolute obligation to intervene, and you did n't do it.'' Deputy <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Schultheis </PERSON> to find exceptional circumstances that would allow him to sentence <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> to more than the 31-41 months called for by state sentencing guidelines. <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was sentenced Dec. 7 to three years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree criminal mistreatment. He founded the sect, dubbed the `` No Name Fellowship'' as a prayer group of Christian athletes at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, where he played football. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, also pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to a two-year term. Testimony during <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s three-week trial indicated the gravely ill boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> and other church members watched. The spankings were believed necessary to get the boy to confess to what they called the sin of masturbation, which church elders believed was the cause of his illness. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, a 24-year <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> employee, testified that he believed <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>'s assurances that his son was recovering, despite physical signs to the contrary. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, originally were charged with homicide by abuse. The charge against the <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was later reduced to first-degree manslaughter and charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> were dismissed. Charges of second-degree criminal mistreatment also are pending against three other former sect leaders, whose trials are scheduled for next year. The fellowship, which at its peak claimed about 300 adult members in four states, disbanded in February.

 Despite a Soviet vow to continue searching for survivors of the Armenian earthquake, foreign rescue teams that worked in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> said they were told to stop digging so the town can be bulldozed. Sixty survivors were discovered in the earthquake's ruins Wednesday, eight days after the quake rattled the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region, leaving an estimated 55,000 people dead and 500,000 homeless. Search teams with tracker dogs from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail reporter that they had been ordered out of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a town of 25,000 people nearly totally destroyed by the quake. They said Soviet authorities said they were preparing to blast the ruins and bulldoze the city to prevent decomposing bodies from starting an epidemic.

 A congressional study places the largest government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nation's failing savings and loans, and says the cost could soar even higher unless action is taken quickly The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says the government should spend $ 112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted mergers. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, will need $ 85 billion over and above the $ 27 billion it expects to collect in fees from S & amp; Ls through 1998. However, the congressional auditing and investigative agency warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise. Most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next year, but offer no firm predictions beyond that.

 The time has come for those strangely ironic symptoms that seem inappropriate to the season, but the Rev. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON> offers some reassurance: Those `` holiday blues'' are really quite common. As noted in pastoral and psychiatric counselling, the melancholy oddly descends most widely in the presumably happiest periods, especially the weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas. `` It's when you're suppose to feel good and be happy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pastor who has worked extensively in the mental health field. `` But a lot of people do n't feel that way.'' There's a simple system for helping ward off that despondency, he said _ talking about it with relatives, friends or fellow church members, or getting them to open up about it. `` You ca n't just pull people out of it,'' he said. `` But it can help to encourage them to talk about it, to let them know that most people have such feelings once in a while.'' As a costless Christmas present to others, he suggested in a telephone interview: `` Pay a little more attention to people.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, 39, pastor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Steward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and formerly a pastoral counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, has written some pre-Christmas advice on the subject for fellow clergy. It was distributed by the urban mission arm of the denomination's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> conference <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> cited two main factors that bring on the slump in mood: The holiday reality often does n't match the popularized image, and the pace of activities all around appear abnormally accelerated and burdensome. `` Everything seems speeded up, the merchandising going into a frenzy, people getting behind in their shopping and having to fight crowds and traffic to do anything,'' he said. `` It zaps their energy and their enjoyment, too.'' More basically for many, the problem is shattered expectations, he said. `` They've grown up thinking Christmas should be a big family gathering, with gifts and everybody around and food on the table. But that's often not the way things are.'' In many cases, the contrast is acute for single people, for one-parent families, for the homeless and other poor that `` do n't have enough money to get the one gift a child has wanted all year. For these and others in similar circumstances, the typically portrayed images of Christmas simply do n't live up to the reality and `` it's as if something had died,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It shows on them. They feel guilty. They blame themselves. They're a lot harder on themselves in judgment than God would ever be. By such harsh judgments, emotionally and physically, we're ruining our health. In the pamphlet for clergy, <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> said `` the church has the unique opportunity'' to do two special things: to `` proclaim the holiday season as a time for thanksgiving, expectation and celebration,'' and to `` minister to those who do not feel thankful, expectant or celebrative.'' He said seasonal depression also can bring related illnesses such as ulcers and headaches, and also result in family disputes and violence. `` When people feel helpless and hopeless, the tendency to lash out is greater. Law enforcement and victims' assistance officers receive more requests for services'' than at any other time of year. Although Christmas blues are quite common, he said many people suppress them because `` they feel guilty or ahsamed,'' but a sensitive pastor can spot those seeming listless, disinterested or restless and offer comfort. He suggested pastors build sermons on cases of biblical characters who endured despair, or inviting psychiatrists or hospital chaplains to address church groups on anxiety and depression. Help people to see the holiday blues as `` normal,'' he advised, encouraging them to share their troubles with others. He said pastors are not immune to the problem in this busy season, and tells them: `` Be aware of your own limitations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> said the holiday slump usually starts out as a kind of `` low grade depression,'' and a little help can stop it from `` getting even deeper down the line. `` A lot of deep-seated problems start like this, as a seasonal problem, but those who stay in it get worse and worse and end up very depressed.'' The results, he added, can be serious, such as heavy drinking or suicidal impulses. But why this inconsistent mixture of sadness creeping into a time of joy? `` I see it as strangely consistent in the Christian faith,'' he said. `` At Christmas, there's an element of being down in the pit, and God comes to you there. `` You could n't accept it any other way, and the situation seems you would never get out, but God comes in.''

 The Earth is `` under siege by the invasion of human products that destroy its atmosphere, its water, its flora and fauna,'' says a conference of 40 scientists and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theologians. Citing damage to the ozone layer, degrading of land, pollution of water below and above ground, toxic materials injected into the air, deforestation intensifying droughts and floods, the conference says: `` God's earth faces a crisis ... As the recognition of God's land onwership gave way to the notion of human ownership, land became a commodity ... Humans began treating the land as a resource rather than a created partner.''

 Southern Baptists now feel more free to speak out on social issues because they no longer bear the shame of racial segregation, says the head of the denomination's moral concerns agency. The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told seminary students that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> had hesitated to deal with social problems because of fear of being criticized for segregation. `` I think we at least had the decency at some level of consciousness to be ashamed of the segregation captivity of our churches for most of our history,'' he said. `` We were not able to apply our ethical position on social issues until we were liberated from that.'' Beyond that, he said a different understanding of the separation of church and state has caused a `` sudden upsurge'' in the denomination's political involvement. `` I think the separation of church and state was used as an excuse for not getting involved as much as it was a conviction over whether we should be involved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Watch Those Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Individual and corporate credit users of late have been treating rising interest rates with a calm that hardly befits the situation. The perception, widely held, is that the economy now is better able to handle its debt because many more loans than before carry adjustable interest rates. Flexibility is built in _ or so it is said. A strong argument can be made, however, that the economy instead is much more credit-sensitive than before. The viewpoint involves, among other things, the type of credit, the amount and length of it, and the tax consequences. The calm view of the credit future involves a view of adjustable rate loans, which are far more common on big consumer items than in years gone by. Many see these loans as a positive factor in the credit outlook. That is, instead of being denied loans, as frequently occurred in the days of fixed-interest rates, borrowers will be granted credit. This, it is argued, lessens the dangers of a credit crunch that would bring the economy down. A more concerned view of the situation, however, sees adjustable loans as a threat to stability. With interest rates rising, people may find themselves unable to remain current on loan payments. Same effect: The economy suffers. But there are even more vital elements involved. Except for home mortgage loans, interest on adjustable-rate consumer loans will be taxed more heavily next year. Currently, 40 percent of interest escapes federal income taxes. Next year, the deductible percentage drops to 20. Rising interest rates and falling deductibility, therefore, can produce a one-two punch that could put some folks down for the count. Moreover, many of these consumer loans are for periods considerably longer than just a decade ago, and that too can create problems. Car loans are made for as long as five years now, which often may be longer than the life of the car. Stress already is becoming serious in some automobile markets, with the repossession rate rising markedly this year. But repossession does n't always resolve the problem. Some five-year-old cars simply are n't worth taking back. The corporate market has its own problems. Business demand for short-term credit has been fueled by the surge of leveraged buyout activity. Some of these loans probably are poor to begin with, but an increase in interest rates, and perhaps an economic downturn as well, might quickly turn them into bad loans. It might not take much of a downturn to show how unsound some of these LBO loans are, because many were made on the basis of cash flow analyses that were optimistic even for a booming economy. LBOs also are soaking up liquidity, threatening to limit funds available for more productive activities. Illiquidity could develop in 1989 because gross national product has been growing much faster than total bank reserves. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could radically change the game too, although the chance of it being able to do so within the next year is questionable. Still, it is possible that a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to reduce budget deficits might seek revenue by taxing some of the LBO debt. Right now, interest companies pay on LBO debt is n't taxed. Perhaps the nicest thing that can be said about the credit situation is that interest rates might not rise, as so many forecasters expect and as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy would seem to indicate. Among others, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expects that a slowing of economic growth in 1989 will allow interest rates to fall sharply. But even if they do, there's an awful lot of debt out there to be serviced.

 Two days before Christmas 20 years ago, the captive crewmen of the spy ship USS Pueblo crossed the `` Bridge of No Return'' to freedom, but they still have n't put their bitterness behind them. `` I thought they would shoot me in the back,'' recalled crew member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON>. `` I did n't believe it until I was on the other side.'' `` I felt like I had just come back from the dead,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, captain of the ship that had been seized on the high seas by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the first such taking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in a century and a half. The crewmembers remain angry at the American military's failure to protect the lightly armed vessel or to come to its aid. `` There were so many people at the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> level on down who were n't paying attention to their damn job,'' said <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>. `` They would have greatly preferred for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to have done us in completely.'' Instead, one crewman was killed in the attack and the 82 others were subjected to 11 months of brutal captivity. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> at that time had enormous military forces in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> within 5 minutes flying time of us,'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, now 61, said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I would have thought something could be mustered to come to our aid. But everybody just forgot we were there.'' <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, was a civilian oceanographer employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and assigned to the <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> to provide a cover for the ship's real mission of collecting electronic intelligence. He believes the capture demonstrated an American naivete about the world. Conducting espionage off the North Korean coast was not the same as running similar missions off the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. `` The North Koreans did n't play by the rules.'' Throughout the attack, seizure and early days of captivity, <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said, `` We expected someone to come over the horizon to rescue us.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chicca </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who worked as a Korean linguist on the Pueblo, said he still finds it difficult to believe there was no retaliation. `` I would lay the blame on every military commander who was in helping range and did n't come,'' said <PERSON> Chicca </PERSON>, 44, in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Retired Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> at the time, said it is difficult to provide protection for a spy ship. Writing in this fall's issue of Naval History magazine, <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said, `` There is n't any way you can do anything for an intellgience-gathering ship unless you want to accompany it with a destroyer, which would defeat the purpose.'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 after 27 -LCB- years of service, said the lack of preparedness that permitted the Pueblo humiliation persists in the military today. Pointing to the failed mission to rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980 and the terrorist bombing that killed more than 200 Marines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983, he said, `` As the years have passed I have learned of the incredible disarray our defenses are in.'' The weather was clear and cold on Jan. 23, 1968, as the <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> lolled about 15 miles off the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> coast _ three miles outside the communist nation's territorial waters. <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> was taking water-temperature measurements as four North Korean torpedo boats and two subchasers, all heavily armed, approached the 176-foot Pueblo around noon. `` They circled around and had their guns trained on us,'' <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said. A subchaser raised a signal flag asking the Pueblo's nationality, and <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> ordered the hoisting of the American flag. When the subchaser ordered the <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> to follow it, the American ship began to move away. One of the boats suddenly opened fire on the Pueblo with its 57mm cannon, slightly wounding <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> and another crewman. A later salvo killed Fireman <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> and wounded <LOCATION> Chicca </LOCATION> and several others. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> ordered the Pueblo stopped and stalled for time as crewmen radioed for help and frantically destroyed classified documents. Shortly after 2 p.m. the Pueblo, which never fired a shot from its .50 - caliber machine guns, was boarded by about 10 North Korean soldiers clad in olive green quilted jackets and carrying submachine The Pueblo became the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship captured since 1807 when a British ship forced the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> to surrender off the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> capes. After the North Koreans failed to extract `` confessions'' from the men during initial interrogations, the torture and beatings began. `` They wanted us to say we were inside their territorial waters and spying on them,'' <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said. `` You were helpless, and after a while, hopeless.'' The worst part of the imprisonment was `` hell week,'' which came late in the crew's captivity, <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said. `` They had me kneel down and took a hammer handle and started pounding my head. They put a board on the back of my knees and jumped up and down on it. `` After it stopped they came in and gave me a pail of water and a brush to wash my blood off the floor and stucco walls,'' <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said he was `` kicked into unconsciousness. That I endured a few times.'' <PERSON> Chicca </PERSON>'s nose was broken several times. `` They did n't like <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Freedom finally came on Dec. 23 at the bridge separating <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ but only after <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials signed an apology that they immediately repudiated. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> court of inquiry recommended a court-martial for <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, who violated the hallowed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> code of `` do n't give up the ship.'' That finding was reduced to a letter of reprimand by the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The court of inquiry also recommended a reprimand for the admiral responsible for ensuring the Pueblo's safety. Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> overturned the panel's recommendations on the day they were made public, saying the Pueblo crew had suffered enough `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> -RRB- had n't surrendered they would have blown the ship out of the water,'' <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> said. `` It would be suicide.'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said he was under orders to observe the North Koreans but `` not to incite them.'' Still, he said in some ways he feels personally responsible. `` Whatever I was unable to do are the things I feel worst about,'' he said. `` If I had a way to destroy the ship, we would have abandoned it and blown it up. I tried to get cans of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> before we sailed, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said they did n't have any.''

 For years, playing the blues was a sure way to get them, says guitar great B.B. King. `` That has hit me pretty hard, that the blues were not popular for a long time,'' said King, recalling the days in the 1960s and'70s when he was more popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than at home. `` It was like being black twice. But I kept working hard, kept practicing, kept playing.'' He and `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON>,'' his guitar, are still playing. After overcoming prejudice both racial and musical, King is now revered as a blues giant; he's just released his 52nd blues album, and he almost steals the show from U2 in their concert movie, `` U2 Rattle and Hum.'' `` I was in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and -LRB- U2 lead singer -RRB- <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> came by,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said recently about their collaboration. `` I'd always admired him and the group, and we talked about songwriting. I told him to think of me when he was writing, and he said, ` OK, I'll do it.''' The result, `` When Love Comes to Town,'' features King swapping vocals with <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> and playing his distinctive lead guitar over U2's backbeat _ a merging of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> delta and the <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isle </ORGANIZATION> recorded at the renowned <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. King, 63, was born in <LOCATION> Indianola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and took up the guitar at an early He started out playing and singing gospel, but soon began taking requests from churchgoers for more secular music. Making the guitar a career, he recalled, was a financial decision easily reached. `` I made $ 22.50 on a plantation driving a tractor all week. Playing guitar on a Saturday night I made $ 25 _ understand, that's for one evening,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said `` That's when I decided.'' King moved to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> after World War II, dubbing himself the `` <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION>'' _ later shortened to B.B. In 1951, he scored his first hit with `` 3 O'Clock Blues'' and his career was off and running. But during the British Invasion of the'60s and the disco craze of the'70s, King and his music slipped into the background. Despite the lack of acclaim, King never considered playing any other music. `` No, I did n't even think about it; I never felt that way,'' he said. `` I felt bad, I felt ridiculed, looked down upon for doing this kind of music. I wished it was different, but everything I play is bluesy.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said his instantly-recognizable guitar style was developed more because of his ears than his hands: `` I ca n't hear lows, so I would turn the treble up. That's how it started.'' But it's evolving to this day, he said before a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> appearance at the <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and Hedges Blues Festival to benefit the homeless. `` It's always changing. I'm influenced by everything. There are young people today who come up and say they idolize me _ I learn from them. It's a round-robin.'' Another thing that has the veteran musician smiling is the number of current artists who are acknowledging the blues `` are the mother of all music.'' King cited <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> as a particular favorite. Then he named another musician who loved the blues: the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. `` I remember once an interviewer asked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> what he'd like to being doing. And he said, ` Playing guitar, playing the blues like B.B. King,''' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` He never knew what that meant to me. It feels good to hear people talk like that.'' Despite his advancing years, <PERSON> King </PERSON> keeps an active schedule; he estimates spending 300 days a year on the road. And he has no intention of hanging up `` Lucille'' any time in the near future. `` When the great creator says it's enough, that's when I'll stop,'' said King `` What else would I do? It's like Count Basie told me one time: My friends are around the world. If I stopped playing, how could I see them all?''

 Another holiday season brings a riot of photography books, on subjects ranging from the honey hunters in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> to water towers, taken by photographers from <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to f-stop <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. All of the people who have been storing those back issues of National Geographic can throw them out if they can come up with $ 65 for `` Odyssey: The Art of Photography at National Geographic'' -LRB- Thomasson-Grant -RRB-. The selections from 100 years of National Geographic photography are rich in quality and variety. Among other retrospectives, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loengard </PERSON> has assembled `` Life Classic Photography: A Personal Interpretation'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, $ 24.95 -RRB-. Each photograph is accompanied by a succinct, provocative statement on how the shot came to be, giving it a textbook value. The West is at the top of landscape books with two works from the <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>: `` <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>: Letter and Images'' -LRB- $ 50 -RRB-, and <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` The West'' -LRB- $ 60 -RRB-. The <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> book is distinguished by the late photographer's lucid personal reflections on his art, while <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s shots stand alone with the luster of oil paintings. To complete the history lesson, the life and work of a Western photography pioneer can be found in `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Transformation of the American Landscape,'' by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 39.95 -RRB-. The hit of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is `` Hometowns: An American Pilgrimage'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, $ 50 -RRB-. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tice </PERSON> looks for a connection between three little Midwestern towns and three large figures they produced: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Fairmount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s Hannibal, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` Wayfarer: A Voice From the Southern Mountains'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Oxmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, $ 50 -RRB-, is photographer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bake </PERSON>'s fourth book on the South. The poet <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> spins an interesting but uneven tale to accompany the photographs. One of the best features on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> comes from Life magazine legend <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenstaedt </PERSON>, who in `` Eisenstaedt: <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Oxmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, $ 35 -RRB-, lets us in on his personal collection of 50 years of photographing his summer place. From more exotic places come rare glimpses at `` The Honey Hunters of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>,'' by <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, $ 29.95 -RRB-, and `` The Whisper of Stars: A Siberian Journey'' -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pequot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 24.95 -RRB-. The first offers breathtaking shots of the Gurung tribe committing the cliff-hanging robberies that have helped sustain the Himalayan people for centuries. In the second, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossfeld </PERSON> captures the warmth and life of an almost mythically forbidding land. There also are portraits aplenty this year, from the popular study of the ruling house of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> in `` <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaton </PERSON>: The Royal Portraits'' -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and Schuster, $ 35 -RRB-, to <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s evocative look at girls on the brink of maturity, `` At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women'' -LRB- New Images, $ 25 -RRB-. At the head of the class is `` Album: The Portraits of <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Michals </PERSON> 1958-1988'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Twelvetrees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 55 -RRB-. <PERSON> Michals </PERSON> says he is only sharing an encounter he had with movie stars and ordinary people, that most were strangers to him and therefore his portraits revealed `` nothing profound about the subjects or captured anything.'' But there is an almost palpable self-consciousness _ on the part of the subjects and the photographer _ that gives these portraits a special freshness. `` <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>: Pictures of People'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, $ 40 -RRB-, coincides with the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>'s first retrospective on the 41-year-old photographer. His use of a large-format camera, not in vogue since <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' Depression-era work, forces some sobering confrontations with subjects such as the elderly and AIDS victims. Like <PERSON> Beaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichfield </PERSON>'s royal portraits helped make him one of the few British photographers to work for Vogue. His portraits and pictures from a style that emerged from commercial work are presented in `` <LOCATION> Lichfield </LOCATION> in Retrospect'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, $ 35 -RRB-. Jazz lovers will be thrilled with `` Jazz: A Visual Retrospective'' -LRB- Billboard Publications, $ 60 -RRB-. Designer <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> has combed archives for portraits so often revealing because the subjects, as critic <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hentoff </PERSON> says in introducing the 350 photographs, `` are less likely than most people to wear masks.'' An insider's look at 50 years of jazz can be found in `` Bass Line: The Stories and Photographs of <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>,'' by <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 39.95 -RRB-. The great bass player also has a remarkable eye. For cultural significance there may be no more important a book than <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiermair </PERSON>'s `` The Hidden Image'' -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 45 -RRB-, a look at the evolution of the male nude in photography. But like `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, $ 50 -RRB-, whose beautiful work has long been augmented with sometimes shocking male nudes, the book will not be of general appeal. If one of photography's aims is to draw attention to details we might otherwise give little notice, there is no more successful book than <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' $ 50 `` Water Towers,'' by <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Becher </PERSON>. The effect can only be realized by leafing through the <ORGANIZATION> Bechers </ORGANIZATION>' groupings of these often overlooked staples of the industrial landscape Among other books of interest, author <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and photographer f-stop <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> -LRB- his legal name -RRB- take a look at gargoyles in `` Nightmares in the Sky'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, $ 29.95 -RRB-; <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON>'s talents help make potent `` <LOCATION> Manzanar </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Times Books, $ 27.50 -RRB-, a look at one of the Japanese internment camps of World War II; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarenza </PERSON>'s `` Landscapes of the Mind'' -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Godine </PERSON>, $ 40 -RRB-, is studio work for the most serious artists

<HEAD>Feds Restoring Salmon Run for Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UMATILLA, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Few people remember the days before irrigation dams killed the salmon runs on the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> never forgot, and more than 70 years after the river's waters became the property of white farmers, the Indians are seeing salmon returning as a result of a huge federal commitment to restore a part of the circle of life. `` It's like a part of us returns, part of my body,'' said <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice chairman of the board of trustees for the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> tribe. `` Because that is part of my body, the salmon.'' About 600 members of the tribe still live on a reservation just east of <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, about 40 miles up the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from where it empties into the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at this town. The treaty that put them on the reservation in 1855 was supposed to guarantee the right to gather traditional foods in their usual places, including the salmon swimming up the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But after 1914, when a series of five irrigation dams was built, so much water was diverted for farms there was n't enough left in the riverbed for the coho and chinook salmon to swim through the broad shallow stretches and over 24-foot-tall Three-Mile Dam to spawn in the headwaters and tributaries. Only the steelhead, a type of rainbow trout related to salmon, survived the dams, because they could wait for the winter rains to raise the river and were better at climbing the crude fish ladders. For the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> tribe, the loss of the salmon left a gap in the circle of eight inseparable elements that make up life: speech, food, religion, shelter, clothing, water, the land and the person. `` When we talk of food, we talk of food that Creator, he lent this to us,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> `` What you would call the amber waves of grain are not really that important to an Indian background. I know the farmer says irrigation is bread and gives food to the person. To the Indian person, no.'' In 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> with a mandate to restore fish runs wiped out by dams in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> system. That's when the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> treaty began to have power. Working with the council, the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> that markets power from 28 dams, has spent $ 8 million on the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION>, and is committed to a total of $ 25 million, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcotte </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> basin project for BPA. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION>, because it sells electricity from dams that devastated fish runs, to set aside a portion of its profits `` protect, mitigate and enhance'' fish and wildlife. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> use that money on their respective lands, and the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Wildlife uses it on private land, to stop erosion that smothers spawning beds, to deepen shallow channels, and to build new fish ladders, traps and outtake screens on the dams. A new hatchery is planned near the mouth of the river. Between 1981 and 1987, <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION>'s expenditures to improve <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> basin fish runs included $ 120 million in direct payments and, it calculated, four times that much in indirect payments such as lost revenue from storing water to help fish get over the dams rather than using it to turn turbines. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who manages the fisheries program for the <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, is seeing the effects. `` This was the very first year we've gotten adult coho back to the river,'' he said. `` We've got a total of about 1,500 coho back so far. The fall chinook we are getting is the best run we've had, too. The total run of adults and jacks is approaching 1,500 as well.'' In the next 15 years, <PERSON> James </PERSON> hopes to see 40,000 salmon and steelhead returning annually, with 15,000 reaching the headwaters to spawn. November marked the first time in more than 70 years that the <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have been able to take salmon from the river carrying their name. The fishing place and the memories of salmon in this river are so distant from the reservation that few took advantage. But more are expected as the runs improve. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a farmer on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irrigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, stood in hip boots and wielded a net as he helped state biologists gather fish in a trap at Three-Mile Dam to analyze the success of various smolt releases. `` Agriculture has kind of been in direct competition with what's going on here,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said `` As long as we can work together on it, it will be an excellent deal. There's also no way of stopping it. `` For every one of us with irrigation rights, there's 50 guys who want to go fishing.'' The biggest improvement of all will be a $ 42 million <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> project to supply local farmers with water from the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. That will leave for the fish the water that farmers used to take from the <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION>. The program has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but has yet to be financed. `` The government created the problem by subsidizing all the irrigation system dams built early in the century,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>. `` Before that, the water was to be kept in the river so the salmon could reach the reservation. `` I like the way the irrigators' attorney put it. The government sold the car twice, and now both parties want to drive it.'' `` This was one of the few situations where the tribe and the irrigators thought it was a win-win situation.''

<HEAD>Maverick Researcher's Approach to Developing Cancer Drugs Is
Faltering</HEAD>

 A maverick researcher's efforts to speed tests on unproven cancer therapies by selling them to any patients willing to pay is faltering. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has so far been unable to show that the treatments, which cost as much as $ 24,000, can prolong lives or reduce the severity of symptoms. Although patients stoutly defend their right to seek his experimental help, <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is failing to attract enough patients to make a profit. What is more, he has been attacked by doctors and scientists who say it's unethical, and possibly dangerous, to sell treatments not yet shown to work. Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Relman </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, says patients who go to <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION> `` are people desperate with fear. They're dying of cancer. And they're encouraged to believe there might be some hope. It's cruel deception. It's commercial exploitation of a tragedy. I think it's totally immoral.'' Biotherapeutics was the first profit-making enterprise to take advantage of government reluctance to allow sales of most experimental drugs until they've been throroughly tested for safety and effectiveness. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>'s daring decision to sell such unproven treatments to the public, and risk federal closure, has put <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION> in the midst of a debate over what the government might do to speed delivery of new drugs to dying patients. The outcome is vitally important to anyone who will be touched by cancer, AIDS, heart disease or any other incurable ailment. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is selling what are called immune therapies. They have been widely touted as an important fourth weapon against cancer, augmenting the triple arsenal of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery that cure only about half of the almost 1 million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year. Immune therapies, sometimes called biological therapies, are intended to provoke the body's immune system to destroy invading cancer cells. The hope _ and so far it remains little more than a hope _ is that the therapies may attack tumors impervious to conventional therapies. Another potential advantage is that the immune system may target cancer cells more accurately than conventional treatments, thus producing fewer of the harmful side effects often associated with chemotherapy and radiation. Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, who has done much of the pioneering work in biological therapy, calls this `` the dawn of a new approach to treating cancer.'' `` I've now had almost 20 patients with widespread, metastatic cancer that's disappeared,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> is, however, a sharp critic of <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>. He asserts that biological therapy is not ready for widespread use. `` The worst thing we can do is raise false expectations,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is located in a squat, modern, red-brick building just outside <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, an antebellum town 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> with a picturesque square frequently sought out by moviemakers. The building's Y-shaped entrance resembles an antibody molecule, a reminder of the company's use of cancer antibodies in some treatments. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, the company's dominant presence, is a well-known researcher with more than 300 papers to his credit. Among his accomplishments, he lists the discovery of certain white blood cells called natural killer cells, which help defend the body against disease. He began his research career at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. He left in 1975 to establish the cancer program at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> but returned to the cancer institute in 1980 to initiate research on biological therapy for cancer. He left the institute again in 1984, this time to set up Biotherapeutics, which focuses almost exclusively on the use of biological anti-cancer agents. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is a tough, combative man. He bristles at criticism of Biotherapeutics and seeks opportunities to defend himself and his enterprise. If cancer patients want the treatments he offers _ whether those treatments work or not _ then the patients ought to get them, <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> says. `` Where does society come off saying you ca n't have it?'' he argued. For more than three years, <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> has sidestepped federal regulations on the sale of experimental treatments by claiming to be in the business of patient-funded research. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> says he is not selling treatment. He says he's recruiting patients to serve as subjects in cancer research _ and to pay for the privilege. He says what he is doing is no different from what the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is doing, except for the source of the funding. The cancer institute gets its money from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION> gets its money from patients. But is Oldham selling research? Interviews with patients, <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> and other company officials suggest that people are coming to Biotherapeutics not to contribute to a research effort, but to try to save their lives. Here is the wording on a poster outside his office: `` If you had cancer, and traditional treatments were n't effective, what would you do? Give up? Or fight, pursuing every option? ... When standard therapies fail, we offer patients a scientifically valid option.'' Ask <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>'s patients why they have come to him, and it's clear they're seeking treatment _ not a chance to be guinea pigs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was recently treated by <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> for colon cancer. His doctor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, had told him he could do nothing more for him. Why had <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> come to <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>? `` You do n't have any alternative if you want to fight it,'' he said in an interview in his hospital room. `` Eventually I will die, but at least I'll give it a shot. ... I think Biotherapeutics charging -LRB- for experimental treatments -RRB- is better than not giving people a shot at it.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 60, said he hoped his case would help <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> learn something that might help others, but that was n't why he was there. A salesman for a computer systems development company, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he and his wife paid for his treatment with money from their retirement account. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> knows the Biotherapeutics treatment is a long shot. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> explained that well. And he believes that, ideally, experimental treatments should n't be commercialized, as <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>'s are. `` But the government is n't doing anything,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` You call the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and ask about colon cancer and you get a tape.'' You call <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, and if you are have the strength left and the money, you get treated.

 The two principal therapies <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is using are monoclonal antibodies and adoptive immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies are protective proteins produced in mice that have been injected with human cancer cells. Such antibodies could, theoretically, attack and destroy tumors or could be used to carry cancer-killing drugs directly to tumors. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is selling a monoclonal antibody treatment for $ 24,000. Does it work? `` It's too soon to tell,'' he said. Adoptive immunotherapy involves taking immune cells from cancer patients, stimulating the cells with a drug called interleukin-2, and re-injecting them in the hope the cells will attack the patients' tumors. The cells are called lymphokine-activated killer cells, or LAKs. This treatment has been shown to be of some help in fighting melanoma and kidney cancer. Ten percent of such patients show a dramatic reduction in tumor size, but whether the treatments will improve or extend their lives is not yet known. `` It's probably helping some people,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabner </PERSON>, director of the cancer treatment program at the National Cancer Institute. Kidney and other urinary cancers will strike 22,500 Americans this year and melanoma will strike 27,300, says the American Cancer Society. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is selling adoptive immunotherapy for 50 percent off the regular price of $ 19,400. Does it work? `` It's too early to tell,'' he said. Many of <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>'s critics have questioned why the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has n't acted to stop Biotherapeutics. Charging for experimental treatments is usually prohibited by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, according to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON>, a director in the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s drug evaluation office. `` We in general do n't think people should be charged for investigational drugs,'' he said. `` They have n't been shown to work yet; it's not fair.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> says it has n't made a decision yet on Biotherapeutics. Many doctors outside the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> say the agency is knotted in sharp internal debate. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutt </PERSON>, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief counsel and now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, put the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s fundamental dilemma this way: `` If someone is desperately ill and has no other hope, should the government tell them what they can take? Balanced against that, if the patient is desperately ill and has no hope, should there be protection against them being defrauded?'' An additional complication is that <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION>' company structure makes it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to act. Biotherapeutics does not send its drugs across state lines. It has hospital affiliates scattered across the country, but each hospital has a nearby laboratory that produces drugs according to the Biotherapeutics recipe. Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlington </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s division of biological investigational new drugs, said that limits the agency's ability to act `` With intrastate activities, there is debate over the extent of our jurisdiction,'' he said. While the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> ponders its moves, the ethical debate over <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>'s activities continues Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>, a pediatrician and director of the medical ethics program at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> clearly has conflicting interests. As a doctor, he should be helping patients. As a researcher, he should be trying to advance general knowledge, not to save dying patients. And as a businessman, he should be trying to keep his company afloat. `` It seems to me that the patient ca n't sort that out, even if the researcher can,'' said <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>. The immediate concern of Biotherapeutics is not, however, in resolving these ethical tangles but in curing the company's financial ills In the most recent fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Biotherapeutics </ORGANIZATION> lost almost $ 10 million of the $ 40 million stake it raised to go into business. It treated 400 patients, and, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berneman </PERSON>, the company's president, `` the expectations were that that would have been higher. He would n't say exactly what the company had hoped for. If management ca n't turn its troubled finances around, the company wo n't survive beyond 1990, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, its chief financial officer. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> added, however, that he had little doubt that the company would make it. It has already taken some drastic steps. The price of its most expensive product _ the monoclonal antibody treatment _ has been cut from $ 35,000 to $ 24,000. Adoptive immunotherapy is on sale for $ 9,700. The company hopes to persuade patients' insurance companies to come up with the rest, although insurance companies as a rule do not reimburse patients for experimental treatments. Biotherapeutics hopes the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will approve interleukin-2 next year for use against kidney cancer and melanoma. <PERSON> Berneman </PERSON> thinks insurance companies will then reimburse the costs of adoptive immunotherapy. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> is determined to press on against whatever odds. `` Some of our critics would legislate and regulate against us being available,'' he said. `` And that is wrong.''

<HEAD>No Fan of Perestroika, Castro Sees `Difficulties' with Moscow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As his revolution approaches its 30th birthday, President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has become something of an ideological renegade in the communist world, waging a lonely struggle in defense of socialist purity while others experiment with capitalist reforms. His recent speeches underscore his resistance to change. He has adhered to a strict constructionist viewpoint with only minor variations since that New Year's day three decades ago when he toppled a discredited dictator and proceeded to turn <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> upside down. While the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other communist countries try to overcome economic stagnation by borrowing some capitalist practices, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> remains a no-apologies defender of centralized planning and state domination of the economy. Some analysts even foresee the possibility of the first serious Soviet-Cuban rift since the two countries became devoted allies in 1968. The Soviets are clearly displeased with what they regard as <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> misuse of economic aid, which has averaged about $ 5 billion annually in recent years. In a recent article, the Soviet newspaper Pravda blamed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for `` serious imperfections'' at Soviet-backed industrial projects in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, meanwhile, makes no attempt to conceal his disdain for Soviet reforms. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, he has said, `` must watch over the ideological purity of the revolution. ... That is why we can not use any methods that reek of capitalism.'' He acknowledged recently that his country's future is somewhat more uncertain as a result of the Kremlin's philosophical shift. `` We can expect difficulties that may come from the enemy camp -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and difficulties that may come from the camp of our own friends,'' he said. In 1986, at about the time Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began moving toward capitalist-style reforms, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> shut down a six-year experiment involving the sale by farmers of their produce at market rates. He was afraid that a spreading capitalist mentality and a high-income elite might take hold. Most experts say <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is too valuable an ally for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to cut adrift simply because of differing economic policies. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> provides important political support for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and is widely admired throughout much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> also serves as an indispensable base for Soviet monitoring of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and space activities. At one facility alone, 2,100 Soviet technicians engage in intercepts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications, according to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had planned a huge welcome here for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 9 but the visit was postponed on short notice because of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Despite the apparent durability of Soviet-Cuban relations, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s unorthodox views have left him somewhat out of the Marxist mainstream. While other countries look on material incentives for workers as a fact of life that must be accepted as the price for increased production, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> believes _ perhaps more firmly than before _ that people should work not for personal gain but out of a sense of patriotic duty. To the extent that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is undergoing difficult economic times, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> says the fault lies not with the system but with human frailty, the lack of revolutionary zeal. Whatever the reason, the Cuban economy has been stagnant for more than two years. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, of course, never has been one to follow the crowd. He has spent a lifetime overcoming long odds. In a recent speech, he recalled the time in December 1956 when, at the start of his guerrilla struggle, serious setbacks reduced his forces to no more than a few devoted followers. Defeat seemed imminent. `` Now we are millions,'' he said, using the analogy to underscore his view that seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome through patience and political will. But as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> himself has admitted, no challenge for him has been more difficult than bringing about economic wellbeing for his countrymen. Food and clothing are strictly rationed and there is an acute shortage of adequate housing. For transportation, Cubans must rely on buses that too often are overcrowded or make their rounds too infrequently. Cubans also complain about bureaucratic lethargy and poor service generally, in restaurants and elsewhere. The quality of life for the average Cuban, compared with developed countries, is dreary although there appear to be few destitute Cubans. Many workers finds their jobs unfulfilling. Youths complain about a lack of recreational opportunities. As an alternative to the drab government-controlled press, Cubans these days snatch up Spanish-language Soviet magazines which have a quality Cuban publications lack: openness. <PERSON> Ofelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, who works at a local newsstand, said some Soviet weeklies are sold out in five minutes. `` Two years ago, we used to throw them out,'' she said. There is no overt persecution of Cubans who practice their religion but such people have little hope of rising to positions of authority. Christmas was officially abolished years ago because the celebration interfered with the sugar harvest but there are signs of a more flexible government attitude nowadays toward that occasion. Some families say they are discreetly doing this year what was unthinkable in previous years: putting up a Christmas tree. While there is more tolerance for outspokenness than before, Cubans who make known their disdain for the system do so at their own risk. Worker absenteeism has been a problem for all 30 <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> years, a phenomenon that is not surprising in a country that claims to guarantee a job for everybody. Theft at state enterprises has been a major headache for the regime. On a secret tape that was smuggled out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said `` 1 million police'' could n't solve the problem without stricter accounting controls. In many professions, requirements of the state leave little room for creativity. A Cuban judge knows the judiciary is subservient to the state. A journalist is aware that he must report within the narrow boundaries imposed by party dogma. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> also is viewed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as a threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests because of its generous support for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and aid to guerrilla groups elsewhere A related issue is the militarization of Cuban society. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> spends a higher percentage of its national budget on the military than all but a few countries worldwide. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has 950 battle tanks compared with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 114. Its military establishment is comparable to that of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a country with a population 13 times the size of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s. Among nations that have embraced communism, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> appears to be one of the more successful. Several of the more recent converts to Marxism are wracked by civil war and poverty. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, there is less absolute poverty than in any country in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where unemployment and underemployment rates run as high as 50 percent.

 For millions of Cubans, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> remains an inspirational figure. His oratorical skills are undiminished. He impresses visitors with the breadth of his interests, ranging from medicine to nuclear power. Little occurs in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> which escapes his restless gaze. Seldom has a leader of so small a country had an international impact as great as his. He can claim partial credit for the agreement under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony, independence and black majority rule. That was <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s price for agreeing to withdraw <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Above all, he sees himself as the broker for the dispossessed. He constantly expresses outrage about the injustice of a world in which some countries enjoy boundless abundance while others starve _ 120,000 children every three days, a <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> every 72 hours, he claims. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is proud that the infant mortality rate in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is comparable to that in some of the most developed countries. One reason <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has had difficulty developing economically is that so much of the country's resources go toward meeting basic human needs _ housing, schools and hospitals. The vast majority of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s children have the opportunity to develop their minds and bodies through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s far-reaching educational and sports programs. On a per capita basis, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> quite possibly produces more good boxers, runners, swimmers and baseball players than any other country. While more than a million Cubans have fled the island since 1959, the revolution has rescued countless others, mostly peasants and workers, from the social and economic oblivion they endured under the previous system. Block-by-block `` defense committees'' are used to monitor the politically suspect but they also have helped make <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s streets as safe as any in the hemisphere. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also boasts that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is drug free. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been at the helm in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for well over half his adult life and, at 62, he shows no sign of slowing down. If he does falter, brother <PERSON> Raul </PERSON>, 57, has been tapped as the successor. But <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON>, as he is known to his countrymen, may well be around for years to come. He has outlasted six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents. Next month, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will become the seventh.

 About the time <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was getting ready to introduce its minivans for the 1984 model year, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had their own concept for a minivan on the drawing boards. The result, the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MPV </ORGANIZATION>, debuted in November and marks a milestone in the Japanese automaker's history. The MPV _ an aerodynamic-shaped and smartly dressed package _ is the first <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> vehicle born of an initial design that originated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In fact, the MPV -LRB- for multipurpose vehicle -RRB- is not sold today in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s home country. The vehicle, designed with American buyers in mind, is built in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but sold only in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Sales of about 40,000 are forecast through October 1989, including about 4,000 four-wheel-drive models due out beginning in March, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON>. For the following 12 months, steady sales of another 40,000 are expected, he added. Early results were heartening, with <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> reporting more than 900 sold in the first three weeks the vehicles were out. `` We feel the -LRB- minivan -RRB- market is continuing to expand,'' <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said. `` Our sales need to come from the additional buyers into the market and from the domestics.'' Besides Chrysler, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> also sell small vans, though <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> outpaces all the competition in sales. The No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker has sold more than 1 million of its <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> vans since the 1984 model year. Major Japanese automakers such as <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> also sell minivans here, but <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MPV </ORGANIZATION> is different because it is not as box-like as the competitors. In price, however, the MPV is in the midst of all the others. <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said the base price for a two-passenger cargo van is $ 10,989, with the lowest-priced five-passenger MPV wagon at $ 12,909. The base price for a seven-passenger MPV with the standard four-cylinder engine is $ 13,759. The test vehicle had a V6 engine and topped out at just over $ 19,000. Those price ranges are comparable to the competition. The MPV has a side door that opens outward, like a regular car door, rather than a sliding side door that is standard on other vans. The MPV's side door, however, opens to a maximum 90 degrees _ greater than that on a car door. The design allows a slightly wider door opening on the vehicle than on other small vans, <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> noted. The swing-out door is lighter and easier for children to manage than some sliding doors. The MPV side door also features a bar that's easy to grab and use when manuevering around in the back. In addition, swing-out doors have greater durability and are less prone to rattles during driving, <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said. Another feature on the test MPV _ a seven-passenger model _ was a three-passenger rear bench seat with a seatback that folded down so the folded seat could be pushed upward and locked in place behind the middle bench seat. It's an unusual-looking arrangement but provides cargo space in back. On other vans, the rear seat can be unlocked from the floor and removed, but the MPV rear seat ca n't be removed unless hand tools are used first to unfasten it from the floor. That's a bit awkward and time-consuming for someone who wants to get large, long items in the van. But <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> countered that buyers may not have to remove the MPV rear seat seat at all. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> designed the rear seat bench and the two-passenger middle seat with seatbacks that fold down backwards for a somewhat uneven, but mostly flat, bed. <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> suggested buyers just load their long items on that bed. But I do n't know that owners want long, dirty items _ such as wood _ on their upholstery. Would n't owners rather put the items on the floor as permitted in other vans? -LRB- The MPV's middle seat is removable, however, with a flip of a couple latches, if you have cargo that is not very long. -RRB- The MPV, like all vans, offered good visibility, because of its higher riding profile. Still, it handled like a car, except for some body sway around corners. The van is rear-drive, as opposed to the front-drive Chrysler products, permitting towing capabilities of up to 4,300 pounds with the optional MPV towing package. Despite the rear-drive configuration, however, the MPV has a flat floor, save for the slightly raised area under the rear bench seat where suspension coil springs are located. Probably the most enjoyable part of the MPV was the optional 3-liter V6 engine which performed flawlessly. Teamed with a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, the engine was smooth and peppy. It's the same powerplant that's in the Mazda 929. The standard engine for the MPV is a 2.6-liter four-cylinder that's newly developed for the van, <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said. Another highlight of the MPV was the nicely appointed interior. Upholstery is placed on the sides of the doors, providing soft armrests, and carpeting is below on the sides of the doors, giving the impression of a nicely integrated interior. There was even a nifty pull-down two-cup holder on the side of the front passenger seat. About the only complaint was that the dashboard featured a tiny mapbox and a too-small glovebox. The van's interior was spacious, and legroom was admirable in all three seating areas _ front, middle and rear. It was relatively easy to move around inside, though obviously, you must hunch over a bit. The sloping front dashboard design gave an airy feel. Fit and finish was superb. The test vehicle had the optional, separate air conditioner for rear-seat passengers _ another nice touch. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> says its target buyers are men, but company officials expect women to be the primary drivers. That's explained by the fact that 73 percent of the potential buyers are male, with 88 percent married. The median age is 39, 60 percent are college graduates. The MPV is new, there are no trouble index reports from Consumer Reports.

 The story of a football coach stricken in the prime of life by <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease is n't exactly light-hearted viewing, but <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>, who plays the coach's wife, found the movie `` happy.'' `` It's really about the human spirit at its very best,'' she said. `` I think he inspires so many people by overcoming his own incredible trauma. It's a hopeful, happy movie.'' It was soon after <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> sitcom `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' was finally dropped for good after bouncing around the schedule for two seasons that she was offered the role as <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> in the real-life movie `` Quiet Victory,'' which <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will air Monday, the day after Christmas. Mrs. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> helps her husband, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON> -RRB-, continue his coaching career despite the disease that leaves him unable to speak or move. <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON> had held off new projects until she got final word on `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' so the movie offer came as she was ready for something new. The series was on-again, off-again on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> until April. `` We all thought we were going back to work on the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` Tribune Entertainment was nearly ready to make 44 new shows. Then it fell through. Too bad. It was a good show. But it was the victim of network politics. `` They wanted our Monday night time slot for a new show, ` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place. So they ended up killing two shows. ` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place' never should have been on at 8 o'clock. It was a more sophisticated show.'' `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' was moved to Saturday night its second year, but was soon taken off the air. It returned briefly in April as part of CBS' ill-fated attempt to program sitcoms on Tuesday. April was n't all bad for <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>. She and husband <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> had their son, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>. For `` Quiet Victory,'' she packed up her new baby and spent several weeks filming on Folly Beach, on one of the sea islands off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The Wedemeyers live in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, which is south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but it was too expensive to film there. `` So, we went to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which has palm trees, old houses and beaches,'' she said. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> was 30 when he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, called <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease after the famous <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> first baseman who was also stricken. A former star quarterback at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> was coaching the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gatos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildcats </ORGANIZATION> and teaching mathematics. He was married to his high school sweetheart, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, a former cheerleader. He's a native of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he was known as `` Kalekauwila,'' God of Lightning. His brother is <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON>, another football star, who played Detective <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukela </PERSON> for eight years on `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-0.'' `` Charlie is completely immobile,'' said <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>. `` He can move his lips. He has a portable breathing apparatus and a feeding tube and sometimes gets around in a golf cart. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> reads his lips and relays his coaching commands to the team. ... `` He's a regal, charismatic man. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s kept him alive through her attitude. They both have a wonderful sense of humor. She's a terribly selfless woman. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> in a way is the cheerleader for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>. The community has done so much for them and with them.'' The movie was directed by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, whose father played for the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> until an automobile accident left him an invalid. Now that the movie is completed, <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>, who gained fame as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' foil on `` Mork and <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>,'' is `` shopping around'' for a new comedy series. A sitcom offers `` the most reasonble schedule,'' she said. `` I do n't want my son dragged around while I do more movies. I want the industry to know that I'm available.'' <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>, who has sung in many musicals, including `` Pirates of Penzance'' on Broadway, planned to audition for the role of <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production of `` Phantom of the Opera.'' She said she would have to audition without benefit of having seen the play, since she was unable to get tickets to the show in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Julia Louis-Dreyfus _ One-Woman Greek Chorus on `Day by Day</HEAD>

 On <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Day by Day,'' <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> is sort of a one-woman Greek chorus _ she brings the unglad tidings to a couple of former yuppies who gave up the good life to run a day-care center. <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, a flamboyant stockbroker who's a friend of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> -RRB- and his wife, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> had also been a stockbroker, and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> a lawyer. They quit their high-paying jobs to spend more time with their infant daughter and teen-age son. `` <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON>'s a spoilsport who reminds them of what they're missing,'' <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> said `` ` She has great entrances and exits. That broad can make a joke. `` I hope she's a sympathetic character,'' she said. `` My goal is to make her sympathetic in spite of herself. She's so abrasive. I hope the audience likes her, because she says things everyone wishes they could say. You see a side of her _ I do n't want to say vulnerable _ a side of her that's warm. `` She's a former colleague of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s, but they were merely friends. In this season, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON>'s moved next door so that she can pop into the house more easily. No matter what she says, they remain good friends. That's a sitcom for you. Of all the characters in the show I'd say she's the most cartoon-like. She says terrible things, but people do n't pay that much attention. It's just <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> and her hijinks.'' The Sunday night comedy joined the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> lineup last spring, based on executive producer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s real-life experiences running a day-care center in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It also stars <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> as the Harpers' 15-year-old son, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne-Smith </PERSON> as <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON>, the center's beautiful young assistant. <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON>, an alumnus of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Second City troupe and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live,'' got to know <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> when she was in a spinoff pilot of his `` Family Ties.'' The spinoff was never picked up as a series. `` They were spinning off <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'s character of <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>,'' she said. `` I played a character who was similar to <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON>. She was sarcastic but more intellectual than <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON>. I would never call <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> an intellectual.'' She recently moved into a new home with her husband, writer-actor <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` It's a lovely little cottage with a fireplace,'' she said. `` We're finally getting organized.'' <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> had roles in the movies `` Soul Man'' and `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters.'' `` I did ` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>' right at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> while I was doing ` Saturday Night Live,''' she said. `` I was in the beginning of the film when <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s an executive producer of a television comedy show. I was his assistant. I worked with him for about a week, which was fun. But most of my part was cut out. `` This is such a different experience from ` Saturday Night Live,''' she said of the sitcom. `` On ` Saturday Night' you go to work on Monday morning and have to write your own material with the writers. The hours were nuts. Here, you come to work, and they hand you a script. Working on a sitcom is as close as you can get to having a regular job without having a regular job.'' She and her husband were both on `` Saturday Night Live,'' but they had met earlier at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s a great theater town. You do n't make a lot of money, but you do n't make any money in theater anyway. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s a much easier place to work and live than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but when her parents divorced she divided her time between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I can remember when the Eastern Shuttle was $ 18,'' she said. `` I grew up mostly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and went to high school with a lot of politicans' kids. My stepfather was a doctor. I did every play I could get my hands on. I grew up trying to juggle my time between theater and homework.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit dipped slightly in October and the nation's factories ran at their highest rate in nine years in November, the government says. Stocks and bonds fell Wednesday in reaction to the reports. Investors feared they hinted at higher inflation in the months ahead and possible moves by the nation's central bank to nudge up interest rates. The merchandise trade deficit for October fell 3.1 percent to $ 10.3 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But investors decided the improvement would not continue unless the dollar fell further to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive in world markets. That could depress stocks and bonds. In the day's other big economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry in November was using more of its capacity than at any time in nine years. The operating rate at factories, mines and utilities was 84.2 percent last month, up from 84.0 percent in October and the highest rate since November 1979. That raised speculation that factories were running too close to full tilt, possibly leading to shortages that would boost inflation. `` We're starting to approach levels of capacity utilization in some industries that will mean higher prices. If growth continues at this rate, we'll soon find most industries passing on higher prices and we'll see monthly increases in the inflation numbers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.24 points to 2,134.25 on Wednesday as declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks. In the bond market, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond lost -RCB- point, or about $ 7.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, climbed to 9.04 percent from 8.97 percent late Tuesday. The dollar retreated against major currencies Wednesday, hurt by what money dealers called rumors of a hike in West German interest rates and a negative market reaction to the monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report. `` The figures came out in line with expectations, and since there's overriding bearish sentiment to the dollar, people just resumed selling it,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, a trader at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities futures firm <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Fiber-Optic Cable Beneath Atlantic Goes Into Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Coded pulses of laser light have begun carrying phone calls, video signals and computer data beneath the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on the first fiber-optic cable connecting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The shark-proof cable that went into service Wednesday can carry 40,000 phone calls simultaneously, double the capacity of all its trans-Atlantic copper-cable predecessors combined, even though it measures less than an inch across. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>, the prolific author of science and science fiction, spoke the first official words on the cable in a three-way video conference connecting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Welcome, everybody, to this historic trans-Atlantic crossing _ this maiden voyage across the sea on a beam of light,'' <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said at 10:30 a.m. EST in the first words spoken over the new cable except for test messages. In a sign of the voracious demand for communications, the partners in the $ 361 million project expect the new fiber-optic cable to start running out of room by late in 1991. That's when a new cable with even more capacity will go into service. Fiber-optic service to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Far East will start next spring, and other undersea fiber links will reach to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> by the early 1990s. For residential customers, the new cable, TAT-8, will mean a continued decline in the price of calls trans-Atlantic calls. For businesses, it will mean lower rates and more capacity for the huge volume of computer data they transmit, especially in the areas of finance, travel and tourism. Ordinary television broadcasts still will be carried by satellite because they would take up too much room on the cable. But the cable's builders expect the cable to be used for video conferences between offices, with the signals compressed to take up less room. Lasers have revolutionized phone networks by making it possible to transmit information in the form of rapid pulses of laser light through hair-thin strands of glass known as optical fibers. The lasers transmit information in digital form, that is, coded into a series of ones and zeros. Most long-distance calls within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already are carried on optical fibers. The new cable contains six strands of glass, and two of them are spares. The cable measures 0.8 inch across, except for the sections that are reinforced against shark bites, which are 1.3 inches across. The first undersea phone cable between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, TAT-1, was built in 1956 and could handle 36 simultaneous calls. During its entire 22-year lifetime it handled 10 million calls. TAT-8 -LRB- the TAT rhymes with ` cat' -RRB- can handle that many calls in less than two days. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns 34.1 percent of TAT-8, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> owns 15.5 percent and <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> owns 9.8 percent. All three of those companies sent cable-laying ships to share in the effort. The rest of TAT-8 is owned by 27 other telecommunications administrations and companies. In spite of the huge capacity of fiber-optic cables, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said there is still a role for satellites, and it recently signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expanding its use of satellites. A <ORGANIZATION> Comsat </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>, said other companies such as <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also had signed long-term contracts for satellite usage. The cable touches ground in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tuckerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Widemouth </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Penmarch </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION>. It is buried a yard beneath the ocean floor to a depth of about 3,000 feet so it will not be snagged by fishing vessels. It is clad in steel to a depth of 8,500 feet to protect against shark bites. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said 1988 would be the first year the company handled more than 1 billion calls into and out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fall in Early December Sales Not Seen as Worry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11 percent drop in sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks in early December is n't seen as worrisome in an industry flirting with the second-best calendar year in history. Companies making cars and light trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday reported they sold an average of 29,610 vehicles during the nine selling days in the Dec. 1-10 period this year. That compared with an average of 33,251 vehicles sold during the same time last year, when there also were nine selling days. The automakers reported that car sales dropped 10.5 percent and light truck sales were down 11.7 percent in early December of this year compared with last year. But no one was predicting that the numbers pointed to an industry in a slump. Incentives began to work their way back into car deals during early December last year after a brief hiatus as the 1988 model year started. `` They -LRB- automakers -RRB- started putting on some heavy-duty incentives'' in early December last year, said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You've got a tough time to compare it with. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` That's hard to read,'' she said. `` It's not surprising that they're down a little bit, given that December is bad for auto sales anyway. `` In any -LRB- recent -RRB- 10-day period, you've had so much noise in the period that it's hard to make a comparison. That noise is incentives.'' As the year draws to a close, the companies are looking forward to what could be the second-best sales year in history, behind the 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986. For the year, car and light truck sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have risen 6.9 percent in 1988 over 1987, going to a daily rate of 37,949 this year compared with 35,499 last year. Among the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed the largest early-December decline in car sales, falling 12.9 percent to a daily rate of 8,906 cars in 1988 from 10,226 last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were up 0.9 percent in 1988 over 1987 to a daily rate of 11,776 this year, compared with 11,668 last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in early December fell 11.6 percent to a daily rate of 5,582 this year, compared with 6,316 in the same period last year. But for the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales have climbed 7.7 percent to an average daily rate of 7,121 in 1988 compared with 6,612 in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it sold cars at a daily rate of 2,673 in early December this year compared with 2,979 during the same period last year, a 10.3 percent decline. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has sold 10.3 percent more cars, with a daily sales rate of 3,451 in 1988 compared with 3,130 last year.

<TEXT>
 A management-led group buying out <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to sell some assets of the nation's largest hospital management company to help finance the $ 3.6 billion acquisition `` In order to meet its debt obligations, which include the repayment of a $ 1.3 billion asset sale bridge loan within two years of the merger, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will be required to sell certain of its assets and businesses,'' company officials said Wednesday in a statement. `` HCA is currently reviewing each of its affiliated businesses for possible disposition. However, no decision has been made with respect to which assets or businesses will be sold and no such decisions are currently anticipated to be made prior to the merger,'' the statement said. A management group led by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has obtained commitments for more than $ 4 billion in debt and $ 300 million in equity to finance the buyout. The management group, <ORGANIZATION> TF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, submitted the only buyout proposal by a Nov. 18 deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. The company's board approved the buyout Nov. 22. `` They're still reviewing assets and businesses, and they're not going to make any decision until the merger is completed,'' <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. `` We're looking to get the proxy cleared by the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in mid-January. We're still planning to hold the shareholder meeting in February, what time we really do n't know. <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> officials expect shareholders to approve the buyout. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> has filed preliminary proxy materials relating to the sale with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Co-arrangers for the bank financing are <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.

About $ 1.3 billion will come from the bridge facility that will mature two years after the sale is completed. About $ 280 million is expected to come from an anticipated $ 350 million revolving credit facility, officials said. Equity commitments have been obtained from Frist, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> management and Texas-based investor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainwater </PERSON> for $ 125 million, the <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> stock bonus retirement plan for $ 75 million and $ 100 million from `` affiliates of certain of the lenders,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Trump May Try To Get Control Of Caesars World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock rose just hours after the company announced that developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had invested in the gaming company. At the close of the day Wednesday on Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> stock had jumped $ 4.12 -LCB- a share to $ 29.37 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> with being a shrewd investor. `` I take my hat off to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a wise investment to buy into <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON>. ... We've always felt <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> was one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to $ 40 a share.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether his investment would violate antitrust laws. He filed notice with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of his desire to possibly buy more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> common stock. Although neither <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> will say how much <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once they have acquired at least $ 15 million worth of stock in a company. Caesars World officials refused comment on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s notice, `` due to the confusing content of this notice,'' according to a statement. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also refused to comment Wednesday. `` Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to comment,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In the notice, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he `` has the good-faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of the outstanding voting securities'' of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said, however, that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would not be successful in a hostile takeover of Caesars World. In a similar situation last year involving investor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosnoff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming regulators blocked <PERSON> Sosnoff </PERSON>'s highly leveraged takeover proposal. In a similar situation involving <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would probably also reject a highly leveraged deal, <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> suggested. `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' the analyst said. `` He has -LRB- accumulated -RRB- a debt of $ 1.235 billion outstanding on his three <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> properties.'' Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> can own only three gaming halls in the state. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels. A third, the massive <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON>, is under construction and expected to be completed in 1990. `` I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it does n't make sense to market three in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said `` But the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a profit.'' This is not the first time that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has invested in a rival casino company. He made a $ 30 million profit from investing in <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock and a $ 24 million profit on <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock. He also bought a small amount of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a move that his competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, called a `` publicity stunt.''

<HEAD>ZZZZ Best Turns Into ZZZZ Worst For Convicted Whiz Kid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Deliberations on co-defendant to resume at 12:30 p.m. EST.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Fallen whiz kid <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> listened grimly as a jury announced `` guilty'' 57 times on fraud charges in a $ 25 million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks and small investors. The 22-year-old defendant, who launched his ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning business in his parents' garage at age 16, had been trying to make a plea bargain only hours before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury convicted him on all counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud charges. The jury rejected <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s claim that he was a frightened young boy forced by mobsters into a life of crime, and accepted the prosecution's portrayal of him as a shrewd young con man with a thirst for money, power and fame. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 300 years in prison. Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> set sentencing for Feb. 21. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, said he would appeal the conviction, noting that <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> severely limited evidence on <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s claims of mob pressure. The jury was to resume deliberations today on five charges against <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s co-defendant, accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, who is accused of taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, sensing he would be convicted, had agreed to plead guilty to about 15 percent of the charges, <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said outside court Wednesday. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> said no final agreement was reached. The jury, which reached its verdict after five days of deliberations, made such discussions moot. It took 40 minutes to read the decision. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> fidgeted occasionally, and reached over once to clasp <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>'s hand. The attorney said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was remorseful and regretted what had happened. `` I think he's learned lessons from this,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> never wanted anything more than to build ZZZZ Best into the General Motors of carpet cleaning ... He clearly was involved with a company that was infiltrated by organized crime.'' `` I was just a front man for the mob,'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> had insisted on the witness stand. `` I was just a puppet.'' The youthful defendant told of constant beatings and threats from mobsters, loan sharks and thugs, but there was little corroborating evidence. `` A duress defense is difficult to establish because threats by their very nature are communicated privately,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said. In two weeks on the stand during the four-month trial, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> admitted defrauding numerous investors as well as talk show hosts who hailed him as a teen-age genius of the finance world. He admitted making romantic overtures to a woman banker to obtain her approval on a loan; she testified that she lost her job because of him. He told of bouncing checks, issuing false credit card charges and arranging investor tours of restoration projects that did n't exist. Dozens of victims who lost money in <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s frauds testified. After starting his business, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> had claimed ZZZZ Best was making a fortune restoring fire - and water-damaged buildings when no such jobs were done `` He sold investors on a business that for the most part did not exist,'' <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> told jurors. Soon, he was a familiar face in TV advertisements and on talk shows. He wrote a book about his success and took Wall Street by storm when ZZZZ Best went public in 1986. But the company quickly collapsed in scandal. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> claimed its demise was caused by mobsters, including the late <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Catain </PERSON>, who turned the business into a swindle. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has expressed to me the remorse he has for having been in that situation and his desire to become a meaningful member of society,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> told reporters. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is a young man,'' said <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>. `` I would hope <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> would still be a young man when he is released.''

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a Hungarian refugee from World War II who arrived in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> penniless and became one of its leading business tycoons, has died at age 57 of complications following a heart attack. <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, who died Tuesday, was chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s largest companies. The cause of death was not given other than that it was related to a Dec. 2 heart attack. Known as a shrewd and sometimes ruthless workaholic, <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> once described work as something to `` play at.'' `` I work golf, I work tennis, but I play work,'' he told a newspaper interviewer three years ago. `` I absolutely love it and if another heart attack is the price I have to pay to keep going at this pace, then I'll pay it gladly.'' <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> claimed that money itself was not the prime motive for his constant striving. `` Sure, it's important when you have n't got it. But once you have it, it is merely a barometer of how well you are doing,'' he said. `` Money is the only applause a businessman gets for his performance.'' Arriving in the country in 1949, <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> worked as a gas station attendant, record-shop owner and taxi driver before forming Fire & amp; <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Risks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 with $ 56,000 cash. <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION> is a $ 2 billion-a-year business, and is listed on exchanges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> was born Nov. 2, 1931, in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, of Jewish parents. His father, who had run a large profitable insurance company, died in a <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp when the country was invaded in 1944. He changed his name to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> upon settling in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> state Premier <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> called <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s great entrepreneurs. `` He built up, by his own drive and hard work and native wit, a huge business in a very competitive area.'' <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> is survived by his wife <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> and three children. His son <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON>, 29, a director of <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION>, today was named chief executive of the company. The family has a 41 percent controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Declines Against Yen, Stocks Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar declined today against the Japanese yen on investors' fears of possible interest rate hikes abroad, while stock prices also fell. Trading in both markets was relatively quiet following Wednesday's report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit had dropped only 3.1 percent in October from the previous month to $ 10.35 billion. `` The trade figures did n't provide any clear direction for the dollar, and dealers, anticipating possible rate hikes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are n't taking any large positions,'' said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON>, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar closed at 122.97 yen, down 0.38 yen from Wednesday's close A moderate sell-off pushed the dollar down to 122.88 yen at the opening, but it drifted higher on buying by investment trusts, <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said. It ranged between 122.85 yen and 123.05 yen. `` The market held a sense of disappointment over the slowed pace of improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in recent months, though the latest figures were within expectations,'' said a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> who spoke anonymously. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 156.92-point gainer Wednesday, fell 48.98 points, or 0.16 percent, closing at 29,705.75. Investors, finding no incentives for either buying or selling, remained mostly on the sidelines because of worry over rising interest rates, traders said. Many investors in both markets are also reluctant to take any new positions as the end of the year approaches, analysts said. `` It's a case of the end-of-the-year blues,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> said the market lacked new speculative themes `` Until we get something new, there is n't likely to be much going on this year,'' he said.

 Unemployment in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> fell to a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent of the workforce in November, the lowest level since March 1981, the government said Thursday. The November figure was down from 7.7 percent in October and substantially lower than the 9.2 percent rate in November 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> said. Seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 2.11 million people, down from a revised 2.16 million people in October and 2.6 million people in November 1987. The department said the decline in the number of jobless of 49,300 was consistent with the average 40,000-a-month fall since the beginning of 1988.

<HEAD>Share Prices Higher on Slower Growth in British Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were higher on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange at midday Thursday, helped by news that the growth in British average earnings slowed in October. The news helped ease fears of overheating in the British economy, dealers said. The British government has pushed up interest rates sharply in recent months to help quell inflationary pressures. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.5 points, or 0.37 percent, at 1762.6 at about 12:30 p.m. The index opened 6.6 points down on nervousness ahead of the release of the earnings figures and amid worries about upward pressures on interest rates worldwide. The figures showed the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent in September and August. Volume was light as 228.7 million shares changed hands by midday, compared with 263.6 million shares at the same time on Wednesday. Oil shares continued to dominate trading, as the market remained convinced that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> had completed the long-awaited sale of its 25.2 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. This rumor swept the market late Wednesday and continued to make the rounds Thursday. Dealers said both companies' share prices rose on relief the deal might have finally been completed. <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> shares were up 11 pence at 474 pence, after peaking at 481, while Enterprise shares gained 18 to 534, having been as high as 537. Also in the oil sector, news late Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was talking exclusively with <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> about selling most of its minerals business gave a sharp boost to turnover, especially in BP shares. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> shares, which had risen strongly on rumors ahead of official confirmation of the possible sale, were down 1 at 258. <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION> also reversed its recent course and rose 7 to 400. One dealer said price changes were a correction to the previous moves. But another dealer said the transaction, which would include the sale of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s gold operations, could prove a better deal for <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION> than for BP.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Lord Plumb, Thursday signed the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 52.8 billion 1989 budget into law. It was the first time since 1983, and only the second since 1979, that the budget was signed before the fiscal year begins on Jan. 1 The 1988 budget was only signed in June this year. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 budget amounts to 44.83 billion European currency units, or the equivalent of $ 52.8 billion, with farm spending set at 26.7 billion Ecus _ $ 31.5 billion _ or 56 percent of the total budget. It was the first time agriculture payments were kept to under 60 percent of the budget since the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was founded 31 years ago. This was the result of a deal hammered out by the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in February to strictly control farm payments. The 1989 budget cut agriculture spending by 1.3 billion Ecus, or $ 1.5 billion, because of higher-than-forecast world cereal prices and a cheaper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading Japanese research institute Thursday predicted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy will grow 4.4 percent in the fiscal year beginning April 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, echoed projections issued by other leading economic think tanks over the last two weeks. Like other researchers, <PERSON> Nikko </PERSON> said the bullish 4.4 percent growth after accounting for inflation would be led by strong capital investments and personal spending. Producer prices, on the other hand, are expected to rise by a modest 0.5 percent, while consumer prices are expected to rise by 1.0 percent. The forecast is based on assumptions that the official discount rate will remain unchanged at a postwar low of 2.5 percent, an exchange rate of 120 yen to the dollar and crude oil prices at $ 14.50 per barrel.

<HEAD>Stores Sue State Over Dec. 26 Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five retail stores have sued the State of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the right of all stores to open during normal business hours on Dec. 26 without having to get local permits. The stores are challenging state Commissioner of Labor and Industries <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>'s interpretation of a new state law on store openings the days after Christmas and New Year's. The holidays fall on Sundays this year. Snow ruled that Sunday hours will apply on Monday, Dec. 26. That means the stores can not open before noon unless they get permission from their local police chiefs, and the permits must be confirmed by the state. Snow already has said the state will confirm all local permits, but many local police chiefs have refused to grant them. The suit was filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s Basement, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lechmere </ORGANIZATION>. Permits to open before noon have been granted by police chiefs in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Westborough </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>. Permits have been denied by chiefs in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>. `` The retailers reluctantly decided to take this action primarily for customer-service reasons,'' said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Dawn-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON>. `` On the day after Christmas, customers appear early to make exchanges, to use gift certificates and to take advantage of after-Christmas sales. `` Retailers would lose a lot of customer goodwill by being open in some locations and being closed in others.'' Under state law, when some holidays, including Christmas, occur on Sundays, they are observed on the following Mondays. A change in the law passed last month, and agreed to by a coalition of retailers and unions, allows retailers to open Jan. 1 and Jan. 2, and Dec. 26, but not Dec. 25. But the wording of the change is open to interpretation. Retailers and some legislators said they thought it meant stores could be open during usual weekday hours. Other said they thought it meant Sunday hours would apply.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> officials say they have not decided what assets they will sell to help finance the $ 3.6 billion management-led buyout of the nation's largest health care company. `` They're still reviewing assets and businesses, and they're not going to make any decision until the merger is completed,'' <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> officials released a statement Wednesday outlining how <ORGANIZATION> TF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group of top managers led by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and third-party investors, plans to buy out the health care giant. `` In order to meet its debt obligations, which include the repayment of a $ 1.3 billion asset sale bridge loan within two years of the merger, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will be required to sell certain of its assets and businesses,'' company officials said in the statement. The statement said <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> currently is reviewing each of its affiliated businesses for possible disposition. TF Investments has obtained commitments for more than $ 4 billion in debt and $ 300 million in equity to finance the buyout, the company said. TF Investments submitted the only buyout proposal by a Nov. 18 deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.

About $ 1.3 billion will come from the bridge facility that will mature two years after the sale is completed. About $ 280 million is expected to come from an anticipated $ 350 million revolving credit facility, officials said.

<HEAD>EEC Orders Deregulation Of Telecommunications Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The European Economic Community Thursday ordered <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member states to deregulate by 1991 the telecommunications services industry in a move that is likely to meet national opposition. The decision was taken by the executive <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> unilaterally under the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> founding treaty which allows it to impose legislation to stop public monopolies distorting competition. A similar move earlier this year to break national telecommunications authorities' monopolies in the consumer equipment market is being challenged in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, supported by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The latest order would open up to private competition services such as data transmission, leased lines, electronic mail and financial data networks in stages by January 1991. The Commission said in a statement that national telecommunications monopolies in certain countries restricted clients' use of infrastructure and charged `` disproportionate'' prices for services in relation to cost. These measures limited the supply of telecommunications services, it said. It said that telecommunications services were growing fast and predicted that data transmission services would grow by 15 to 25 percent a year once the market was deregulated. The value of the telecommunications services market in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is estimated at about 64 billion European currency units, or $ 75.5 billion. The Commission will not put its order into effect immediately. It will consult with the member states on the terms of the legislation before giving the final go-ahead in March. The Commission also proposed draft <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> legislation to set common conditions for open access by private operators to public telecommunications networks.

The last trading will occur Friday in a series of expiring stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. This quarterly `` witching hour,'' when program traders engaged in multiple strategies move to close out their positions, has been less stormy for the stock market in 1988 than it often was in previous years. Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a wary approach in a difficult, sluggish trading environment. Many investing institutions that managed to squeeze positive results from their portfolios earlier in the year are waiting out the last couple of weeks before New Year's simply hoping to keep those results intact, brokers say.

Union leaders said of the some 4,400 attendants who voted, 80 percent of them gave the union's board the authority to call a strike if necessary. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said the company had not expected the attendants to agree to a strike. `` We're obviously pleased that nothing is going to happen to impact public travel, especially during the traveling season,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants are paid $ 11,000 to $ 15,000 annually, levels 30 to 35 percent below their counterparts at other airlines. The union is seeking a three-year deal that would boost the lower end of a salary scale by 5 percent and the upper end of the scale by up to 35 percent, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, she said, is offering an increase of about $ 1 an hour. But <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said the airline had made a wage and benefits package proposal it is prepared to implement Jan. 1 that includes raises of up to $ 4.25 per hour. He added, however, that the company will continue talks with the flight attendants.

<TEXT>
 Negotiations to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over air pollution from offshore oil drilling rigs have broken down after more than two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. The department will propose new air pollution regulations in four to six weeks which will tighten current standards, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRocco </PERSON>, spokesman for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> DeRocco </PERSON> said he could give no details of the forthcoming proposed regulations. The state's 1981 lawsuit charged that pollution from drilling rigs in federal waters off southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> made it impossible for onshore communities to meet federal clean air regulations. Negotiators held their last meeting in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> DeRocco </PERSON> said the department had been optimistic that an agreement would result: `` We thought we were going to have something to share with you,'' he said, but no agreement resulted. He said he did not know what the principal points of disagreement were. Interior officials involved in the negotiations were to meet in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> to discuss the breakdown. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> agreed in November 1985 to try to settle the lawsuit under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Other major parties were the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and the Citizens for a Better Environment, supporting the state's position in the lawsuit, and the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, supporting the department.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today threw out a $ 200,000 libel verdict stemming from a 1980 editorial in the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Democrat that said a county board chairman lied about his stand on a tax increase. Without written dissent, the justices said the editorial attacking then-St. <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> was false and libelous, but that <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>'s lawyer did n't prove the newspaper's editors had reason to believe it was false when they published it As a result, the high court said, <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> failed to meet the `` actual malice'' test for libel claims by public officials _ that the statement was made with the knowledge that it was false or a `` reckless disregard'' for the truth. `` Failure to investigate does not itself establish actual malice if the -LRB- editors -RRB- did not seriously doubt the truth of their assertions,'' Justice <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> wrote in the court's opinion. Costello, who was elected this fall to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, filed the lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the newspaper, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargraves </PERSON>, the editorial-page editor who wrote the editorial. The case gained national attention in 1984 when <PERSON> Hargraves </PERSON> was jailed briefly for refusing to reveal the names of people he said were confidential sources for the editorial. The newspaper endorsed Costello in his 1980 campaign for county board chairman, saying he had promised to vigrously oppose any new taxes without approval by voter referendum. After the election, the county board approved a creation of a mass transit district with taxing powers, and the newspaper blasted Costello in a scathing editorial. `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> lied to us ... and when he lied to us, he lied to you,'' the editorial said in part. Costello filed a libel lawsuit against the newspaper, claiming that he had lobbied against the measure but as the board's presiding officer was barred by law from speaking or voting on the issue when a roll call was taken. The lawsuit initially was dismissed by a circuit judge, but a trial was ordered by a state appellate court. Costello was awarded $ 600,000 in punitive damages and $ 450,000 in compensatory damages after the trial judge found that the editorial's statements were false and malicious. On appeal, a divided <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel upheld the verdict for Costello but threw out the punitive damage award and reduce the compensatory award to $ 200,000. The majority opinion called the editorial `` unduly harsh and vicious.'' However, dissenting appellate Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Steigmann </PERSON> wrote that the majority decision `` constitutes a threat to one of our most important freedoms _ the freedom of the press to criticize vigorously, and even unpleasantly, public officials in the execution of their official duties.''

 Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with corn and oat futures slightly higher while wheat and soybean prices were modestly lower. Persistent rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn supported corn futures prices.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank boosted a key interest rate 0.5 percentage points to help prevent inflation from flaring up, but a top official said the move should n't be considered part of a coordinated international rate hike. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> raised the Lombard lending rate to 5.5 percent from 5 percent effective Friday, but it kept the discount rate unchanged at 3.5 percent. The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks when securities are used as collateral. The discount rate is the main commercial bank loan. <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> officials said the change in the Lombard rate came in response to concerns about rising inflation. `` We are in an environment of slightly rising interest rates,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>.

 An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> natural gas producer has won a $ 600 million damage judgment against a <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, but <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> quickly said it would appeal the jury award. The 12-member jury on Wednesday ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary broke a contract to buy natural gas from <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The jury awarded actual damages of about $ 250 million, plus interest, and punitive damages of $ 350 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> officials. The verdict followed three days of deliberations and capped a 4 -LCB- - month trial in <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> before State District Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklar </PERSON>, who still must approve the verdict Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal it. `` I'm amazed _ shocked _ astonished,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel. `` I find it totally incredible.'' The verdict stemmed from a suit the tiny company filed against <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> in December 1985 that alleged <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> broke a contract it had to buy certain volumes of gas, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman M.A. <PERSON> Shute </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> was represented by <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorneys <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, who were not available for comment Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday quoted <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>, who is co-owner of <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, as saying of the court challenge: `` We felt we had valid reasons as individuals to seek fulfillment of the contract.'' According to a statement issued by a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> public relations firm representing <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON>, the litigation stemmed from a practice by pipeline companies _ when oil and gas prices were higher _ of making contracts guaranteeing producers that the companies would buy their gas at fair market prices. <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said the two sides `` had a wide dispute'' regarding the amount of gas <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gas was obliged to buy from <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON>. He did not have the specific amounts of gas each side claimed it had agreed to buy. <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> broke its contract in 1983, but <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said the company was acting on a provision in the contract that allowed it to buy less gas under certain circumstances.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has developed an inexpensive catalytic converter the automaker says is as effective as platinum in meeting exhaust emissions standards. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the automaker is installing the new converter on some 1989 cars. `` To appreciate the full implications of this patented development, you must understand that at least some platinum _ a very expensive and scarce metal _ has always been required in the past to reduce tailpipe emissions to meet government standards,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. The idea for the converter evolved from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s use of `` theme groups'' to develop new automotive technologies and adapt them to the assembly line, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> declined today to reveal any details about the new device or the material in it. He said it would cost significantly less to produce, but was not specific, and did not say how much of the savings would be passed on to the consumer. <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> said if successful, the new device would not be put into the general manufacturing process until after the 1989 model year.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it decided to extend a 1984 antitrust settlement that requires the computer giant to give certain technical information to competitors in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the accord `` has come to serve as an effective vehicle'' for resolving questions on how competing machines can be hooked up to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> equipment. The 1984 settlement suspended a 4-year antitrust case brought by the 12-nation trading bloc against <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was allowed under the agreement the right to give, starting Jan. 1, a year's notice that it would end the arrangement. That meant the arrangement could have expired as early as Jan. 1, 1990. The agreement makes it easier for other companies to compete with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> by setting out a time schedule for release of certain data, generally within four months, to enable competing equipment to interconnect with hardware and software for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s large-scale System 370 mainframe computers. By extending the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> avoided an uproar among Europeans who dislike the dominance of an American-based company in the European computer market. The agreement is relatively painless to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and has not cut into its share of the market. The statement said the community and the company decided that `` neither foresees any change in circumstances that would cause <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'' to use its termination right. `` However, should such circumstances arise, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to review the matter with the -LRB- EEC -RRB- prior to giving any notice,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Verstrynge </PERSON>, an official in the community's competition department, said, `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and the -LRB- EEC -RRB- have agreed that they do not foresee that at the present time such special circumstances will occur. The special conditions were not specified. The move to extend the agreement, he said, was prompted by concern the computer market would suffer from `` fear, uncertainty and doubt'' if <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had the power to give notice at any time. `` It was to eliminate this uncertainy'' that the extension was sought, he told reporters. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is, in terms of revenue, the largest computer vendor in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as worldwide. <PERSON> Verstrynge </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s competition chief, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, met on Dec. 1 with <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, to discuss a continuation of the accord. `` It was an easy meeting,'' <PERSON> Verstrynge </PERSON> said. `` But Mr. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> was totally determined.'' The trading bloc will continue reviewing the agreement annually, he said. An <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, who demanded anonymity, said the arrangement `` does achieve the intended objective'' of providing a means through which the company can provide data to competitors. He said that from August 1984 to last June 30, the computer firm received 66 requests from 20 competitors covering 703 questions. <PERSON> Verstrynge </PERSON> said prior to the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> could announce a new piece of equipment without releasing technical details. `` The competitors could not react with competing products or services because they did n't have the technical information,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ex-NY Fed Reserve Bank Director Pleads Innocent To Insider Trading</HEAD>

 A former bank president accused of leaking confidential interest rate data while he was a director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> pleaded innocent Thursday to insider trading charges. Robert A. Rough was arraigned before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> one week after being indicted by a federal grand jury here. Rough was accused of leaking information on the discount rate set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to principals at <LOCATION> Bevill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schulman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> brokerage firm that later collapsed. The government alleged that <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> made millions of dollars and avoided millions in losses because of the information, which Rough allegedly exchanged for $ 47,000 in interest-free loans. Rough's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON>, said he would need time to review thousands of transactions by the firm, which collapsed in April 1985. Debevoise on Thursday set Rough's bail at a $ 150,000 personal recognizance bond. A hearing on pre-trial motions was set for Feb. 14, and trial was scheduled for Feb. 21. After Thursday's hearing, <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON> and Rough declined to comment. Authorities have called Rough's case the first insider trading involving government securities and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> system. The indictment said that while he was president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Branchville </LOCATION> and sat on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s board from 1982 to 1984, Rough regularly leaked word on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate recommendation to the national <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s final determination on the rate Changes in the discount rate _ the interest on <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loans to commercial banks _ have a powerful impact on the securities markets. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials have called action involving the rate one of their most closely guarded secrets. Discount rate changes widely are regarded as the strongest indication the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> makes of the direction it wants to push interest rates, which affect the price of debt securities such as bonds. After the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> learned of the allegations against Rough, which first were mentioned in April 1987 during testimony of a criminal trial stemming from the <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> collapse, it tightened procedures regarding the rate. Rough formally was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud and securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks. Rough resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, prosecutors said.

 Share prices closed higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by news that British wage growth slowed in October and by some speculative buying of several major stocks. Dealers said overall trading volume remained low, with activity concentrated in a few of the leading shares affected by takeover speculation or special situations. Other share prices were higher in thin volume as the reported slowdown in British average earnings reduced fears that British interest rates would have to be increased again to curb inflation. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 7.1 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,763.2, near the session peak. Volume was a modest 396.2 million shares, down from 447.1 million shares a day earlier. Early in the trading session the market remained in negative territory, preoccupied with evidence of an upward drift in world interest rates. But the market turned around after the government reported that the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent in September and August. Most market forecasts had been for the rate to show no change on the month, while some analysts called for faster growth.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher After German Rate Hike, Gold Falls On Platinum
Selloff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Thursday after an expected increase in a key West German interest rate failed to bolster the West German mark. Gold and silver prices fell in busy trading, pulled down by a sell-off in platinum sparked by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it had developed a catalytic converter that did n't use the metal. Dealers said speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would follow the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s move by boosting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate helped the dollar. Dealers widely had discounted the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s move to raise its key Lombard lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent. But many market players had held on to marks rather than dollars in hopes that the move would boost the mark further against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. When such a rise did not materialize, dealers sold their marks for dollars and other currencies. `` The move was predicted, and there was n't enough reaction to it,'' one dealer said. The Lombard rate is the interest the West German central bank charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as collateral. The discount rate is what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to commercial banks. The West German rate hike followed rate hikes on Wednesday and Thursday by the central banks of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound dipped to $ 1.8280 from $ 1.8335 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7485 West German marks, up from 1.7365; 1.4725 Swiss francs, up from 1.4630; 5.9745 French francs, up from 5.9350; 1.9665 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,288.00 Italian lire, up from 1,279.50; and 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.38 yen to a closing 122.97 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 123.35 yen. A wave of platinum selling was sparked by reports that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said his company had developed a catalyst that was just as effective as platinum in meeting stringent exhaust emissions standards, but was significantly less expensive Platinum tumbled to $ 565 an ounce at the close in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, down from Wednesday's close of $ 600 an ounce and the session high of $ 601. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 416.45 a troy ounce, compared with $ 420.75 bid late Wednesday In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 416.00 an ounce, down from $ 420 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.67 to close at a bid of $ 423.05. Silver bullion prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 6.11 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.16.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Advance, Soybeans Decline On Export Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain futures prices closed modestly higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may have purchased up to 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. But soybean futures declined on the lack of confirmation of a rumored sale of soybean meal to the Soviets, analysts said. The corn market has been strong all week on persistent rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for a large amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and sorghum. Those rumors intensified Thursday, with some observers saying they believed the sale already had been completed. `` It is very likely that the sale has already gone through and we're just waiting for official confirmation,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It would n't surprise me to see some sort of confirmation come in the next 24 to 48 hours,'' he said. At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.28 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.68 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.13 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with January at $ 7.75

<TEXT>
 Snow falls silently on the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> battlefield as <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuckal </PERSON> inspects the ranks of Christmas tree soldiers. Scotch pine, blue spruce and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir are destined for all points of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet their artificial foe: the plastic Christmas tree. `` I'm worried about that,'' says the 18-year-old Schmuckal, shaking the snow from his brown hair. `` They're saying that 42 percent, 48 percent, of people are buying artificial trees,'' he said. With a year of college under his belt, Schmuckal is n't sure there is enough future in his father's northwestern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> Christmas tree farm for him to take the same trade. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> expects Americans will buy 34.1 million natural trees this holiday, while about 30 million people will put up artificial ones. There are other problems. The summer drought killed 2,000 young trees at the Schmuckal farm, flooding hurt <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 1986 harvest, and an increase in small-scale growers threatens to undercut the market. But growers say those woes are sideline skirmishes. From the hand-worked 400 acres at the <ORGANIZATION> Schmuckal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to the helicopter-harvested operations of the nation's largest Christmas tree growers, it is fake trees that are hurting a $ 1 billion-a-year business the most The market share for artificial trees has continued increasing despite a 21.8 percent jump in natural tree sales the past 11 years. Only 20 years ago, fewer than 20 percent of the holiday trees were artificial. `` We ca n't ship artificial trees fast enough,'' said <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` The trees are looking more like real trees each year. And increased prices do n't make any difference. They still sell.'' Artificial trees offer durability, safety and variety, their sponsors say. They come in metallic pink, shimmering silver or decorated with feathers. They come in symmetrical green perfection. But, `` they do n't smell Christmas. ... And they're expensive,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Artificial trees also are causing problems for others: a charity lot in <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> that once sold about 2,000 trees to raise money for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> now reports sales of 1,400. Individual tree growers are doing what they can to compete, pushing quality control programs and improving tree strains. Most trees are stained green before cutting to give them a good color. Farms like the Schmuckal operation prune the crop into classic cones by hand, while some bigger operations airlift the harvest by helicopter so the trees wo n't lose needles from being dragged on the ground or hauled in a truck. But the biggest push came just this year, when the Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> declared war against fake trees with a $ 1 million promotional campaign. About three-fourths of the money is committed to television commercials featuring <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> weatherman <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> extolling pine needles over plastic. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which supplied this year's Capitol Hill Christmas tree, has inaugurated its own promotion with a quality control program. Select trees that meet specifications are bestowed with a `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Snowfresh'' tag before being loaded onto trucks headed for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` We're trying to build up <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. There's something about <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. We have the soils,'' <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said. Oregon growers would disagree, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. Both states ship out about 6 million trees a year and claim to lead the nation. `` We do n't get into it and just say the two states are the top producers,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. Back on his father's farm, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuckal </PERSON> is n't certain <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> can do for Christmas trees what <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> did for potatoes. Too few trees bear the tag and the bulk of what consumers find in hometown parking lots show no origin at all. The national association is not concerned that programs such as `` Snowfresh'' have that impact. Any cut tree is desirable, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` Just get out there and get one,'' he said.

 The number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business failures fell by 6.3 percent during the first three quarters of this year, the best performance in nearly a decade, according to a private survey released Thursday. The number of business failures fell to 44,793 from 47,794 in the first nine months of 1987, the report by <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stated. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate economist, said the decline was `` larely attributable to decreases in the levels of failures in the oil and agricultural states.'' Agricultural business failures fell 54.9 percent. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the number of agricultural failures soared in 1987 when farmers took advantage of new protections under the federal bankruptcy law. The rush to benefit from the new provisions subsided this year, leading to the drop in failures in that industry. The only industry to see an increase in failures was wholesale trade, where 5.4 percent more companies failed during the first nine months of this year than in the same period a year earlier. In other industries, mining failures fell 25.5 percent; transportation and utility failures were off 7.8 percent; retail failures were off 6.6 percent; financial, insurance and real estate failures fell 3.4 percent; failures of service companies were down 1.8 percent; construction failures were off 1.4 percent; and manufacturing failures were essentially unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> is a financial information publisher.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will hold talks next month with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in an effort to open <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s dairy market to more imports. The 12-nation trading bloc would like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to ease measures that it says protect the local dairy industry from foreign competition. The Japanese market for table cheese amounts to about 120,000 metric tons a year, with imports from the European trading group accounting for some 27,000 tons. The study found that sales of European dairy products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were hindered by import quotas on cream, butter, powdered whey, and condensed and powdered milk. It also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> maintains a 35 percent tariff on processed and natural cheeses and limits the opening of large supermarkets that are the main outlets for sales of imported cheese. Moreover, it said, exporters were faced with long delays at customs offices and discriminatory labeling rules. As a result, European Community officials should press <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to slash the tariff on imported cheese, ease restrictions on expansion of supermarkets and shift government subsidies from production to promotion and consumer education, the study indicated. The study found that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s per capita consumption of dairy products is one of the lowest among industrialized nations.

<HEAD>National Semi Announces Loss; Micron Has Big Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced a $ 25.2 million net loss during its second fiscal quarter and company officials blamed the loss on a sharp decline in bookings and sales and a weak semiconductor market. The results contrasted sharply with those of another chip maker, <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which said late Wednesday the profits in its first fiscal quarter nearly quadrupled. National Semiconductor of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said its loss was in contrast to a net profit of $ 11.6 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the losses, noting that the company faced a squeeze on pricing because of intense competition in its markets. Sales for the second quarter, which ended Nov. 27, were $ 705.3 million compared to $ 640 million for the same quarter last year. For the first half of fiscal year 1989, sales were $ 1.35 billion, with a net loss of $ 55.7 million. Sales in the same period of 1988 were $ 1.15 billion with net earnings of $ 25.1 million or 19 cents per share. <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, did better because it makes computer memory chips, which are priced highly because of short supplies. It earned $ 32.2 million on revenue of $ 110.4 million during the quarter that ended Dec. 1. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 8.4 million on revenue of $ 43.2 million. Per-share earnings were 88 cents for the quarter, compared to 33 cents per share a year ago. However, both income and revenue were down from the last quarter of <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 fiscal year, when the company had a record quarterly profit. The declines were due largely to a higher effective tax rate and costs associated with hiring new employees, said <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedard </PERSON>, manager of investor relations. In addition, the company has been setting money for legal expenses. In November, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> filed a patent infringement lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> is producing memory chips that disregard TI's patents.

 The stock market posted a modest loss today in an atmosphere of caution approaching Friday's `` triple witching hour.'' The last trading will occur Friday in a series of expiring stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. This quarterly `` witching hour,'' when program traders engaged in multiple strategies move to close out their positions, has been less stormy for the stock market in 1988 than it often was in previous years. Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a wary approach in a difficult, sluggish trading environment. Many investing institutions that managed to squeeze positive results from their portfolios earlier in the year are waiting out the last couple of weeks before New Year's simply hoping to keep those results intact, brokers say.

 <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.65 billion cash and stock buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was approved overwhelmingly by shareholders of both companies on Thursday, despite criticism by some <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> workers and shareholders of big severance payments for the company's executives. `` I only wish the powers that protected the executive board would have protected the employees a little more,'' said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> employee for three years. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and some others said their benefits have been cut, while top executives of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> are receiving severance payments, called golden parachutes, that reportedly total about $ 98 million. Under the buyout, shareholders will receive one share of <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> common stock plus $ 7 in cash for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>. Based on Thursday's closing price, the deal is worth $ 28.25 a share in cash and stock. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 28 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The combined companies will operate under the <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> name. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, a Greenwich-based financial services and direct-marketing company, is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm it acquired in 1987 for $ 750 million. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced the layoffs of 120 employees due to soft business conditions. Baltimore-based Commercial Credit is involved in consumer credit, including lending, property and casualty insurance and credit cards. Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> shareholders voted in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> shareholders met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s proxy statement does not give a total figure for the severance payment package for its top executives. But published reports have put the figure at about $ 98 million. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> spokespeople declined to discuss the figure, because some shareholders have filed lawsuits against the company and its directors in an attempt to stop the merger. The proxy does say that <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will receive $ 19.2 million in cash, $ 8.6 million to cover excise taxes and $ 10.4 million, relating to cancellation of stock options. The proxy also reports that <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>, who will be the new company's largest individual shareholder and director and chairman of the board's executive committee, will receive an annual fee of $ 250,000, office space, staff, plust business expenses `` I can only tell you it is our judgment that this merger is in the best interest of the shareholders,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> also said he could not discuss the golden parachutes because the matter is in litigation. But he told one shareholder who complained that 93 percent of the shareholders voted in favor of the merger, `` so I guess you're in the minority.''

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Dec. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,064.1 billion from $ 3,061.2 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,899.4 billion from $ 3,895.9 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 786.4 billion from a revised $ 787.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said the proposed consent decree is for settlement purposes only and does n't constitute an admission by the company that it violated the law.

<HEAD>Platinum Market Collapses On Ford News</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices collapsed Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced development of a platinum-free catalytic converter that could slash global demand for the metal by one-third. On other markets, sugar futures plunged; energy futures fell; grain futures were higher; soybeans were lower; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. All platinum futures except the spot December contract settled down the daily limit of $ 25 with the January contract at $ 579.50 a troy ounce. The spot contract, which has no limit, finished $ 34.10 lower at $ 531.90. The use of platinum as a catalyst for chemical reactions in automobile pollution-control systems accounted for about 38 percent of world consumption of newly produced platinum last year and was expected to represent about 35 percent of consumption this year. Speculative buying of platinum futures had been rising due to recent projections that demand would continue outstripping production through 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement jolted the market. `` It's a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All our reasons for being bullish on platinum have been defused.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, New York-based metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed: `` It's a major development. It could potentially wipe out one-third of platinum consumption.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> announced a pilot program for the invention Wednesday evening but the news did n't hit the markets until after the opening of platinum trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. `` It came in dribs and drabs,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>. `` I had heard it as a rumor as soon as the market opened but I was hesitant to act.'' She said the market started falling from its $ 606 opening, ad at $ 601 she recommended selling the contract. That was at about 9:35 a.m., she said. Selling quickly escalated until the market went limit-down at about 9:50 a.m. The first news service report of <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s remarks came across the wires at about 10 a.m. EST. The platinum selloff spread to gold and silver futures, which are traded on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 8.60 to $ 10.10 lower with February at $ 416.60 a troy ounce; silver was 11.6 cents to 13 cents lower with March at $ 6.185 a troy ounce. Sugar futures prices plummeted on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on indications that near-term availability of sugar was on the rise, analysts said. Bearish factors included <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s announcement that it planned to move up shipments of 100,000 metric tons of sugar from July to March, and indications that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been selling sugar, said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar settled .44 cents to 2.76 cents lower with the active March contract at 10.84 cents a pound. Oil futures retreated in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid profit-taking following the previous session's rally, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 38 cents lower with January at $ 16.35 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to .55 cent lower with January at 50.94 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .32 cent lower with January at 43.65 cents a gallon. Grain futures finished modestly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may have purchased up to 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. Soybean futures declined on the lack of confirmation of a rumored sale of soybean meal to the Soviets, analysts said. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.28 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.68 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.14 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents lower with January at $ 7.75 -LCB- a bushel Cattle futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in positioning ahead of Friday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while most pork futures declined. Live cattle settled .02 cent lower to .37 cent higher with December at 72.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .20 cent higher with January at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .30 cent lower with December at 43 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents lower to .20 cent higher with February at 43.87 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled .70 point lower at 277.70.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Gold Drops on Platinum Rout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened Thursday after a West German interest rate hike failed to hurt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and led money dealers to assume the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit in this country. Gold prices dropped as much as $ 8.60 an ounce in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in reaction to tumbling platinum prices, a result of fears that the world automobile industry demand for platinum could dwindle. Precious metals historically move in the same direction. Currency strategists said the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s hike in a key lending rate from 5 percent to 5.5 percent raised speculation that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank would raise its discount rate, the loan fee to financial institutions, which as of Thursday stood at 6.5 percent. A higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate would tend to make dollar-denominated holdings worth more. Currency dealers also said the West German bank's move had generated optimism that the West German mark would riseas well. But when the mark did not rise as expected, speculators sold it and bought dollars instead. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.38 Japanese yen to 122.97 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 123.35 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 123.86 yen, up from 122.77 yen late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound dipped to $ 1.8280 from $ 1.8335 on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fetched $ 1.8192, down from $ 1.8295 Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with rates late Wednesday: 1.7557 West German marks, up from 1.7374; 1.4783 Swiss francs, up from 1.4655; 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2020; 6.0075 French francs, up from 5.9390; and 1,296.50 Italian lire, up from 1,285.25. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late rates Wednesday: 1.7485 marks, up from 1.7365; 1.4725 Swiss francs, up from 1.4630; 5.9745 French francs, up from 5.9350; 1.9665 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,288.00 Italian lire, up from 1,279.50; and 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986. In the precious metals market, a barrage of platinum selling was incited by reports that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had devised a substitute material for platinum, which is heavily used by the automobile industry for emission control devices. The platinum panic spilled into the gold market. `` With platinum moving down so sharply, the psychology tarnished the other precious metals and resulted in a wave of selling,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a strategist at American Precious Metal Advisers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold was quoted at $ 413 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 421 late Wednesday. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold for current delivery dropped $ 8.60 to $ 412.90. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 4.30 an ounce to $ 416.45; in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> it fell $ 4 to $ 416; and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it rose $ 1.67 to $ 423.05. Silver bullion for current delivery dropped 11.6 cents a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> to $ 6.061.

<TEXT>
 Bond prices slipped Thursday and a key short-term interest rate rose as traders puzzled over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had taken steps to boost interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond fell 3-32 point, or about $ 1 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield edged up to 9.05 percent from 9.04 percent late Wednesday. Trading volume was light, as investors sorted through the available evidence on the economy's strength and the central bank's likely reaction to the growth Some analysts expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will tighten credit for fear that the pace of economic growth will rekindle inflation. Economic reports this week indicated only a moderate decline in the nation's trade imbalance in October while industrial production, the industrial operating rate and retail sales all rose in November. Traders also pointed to the West German central bank's hike in one of its key lending rates Wednesday as increasing chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may do the same. Higher interest rates depress the prices on outstanding bond issues. An important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lending rate, the federal funds rate, rose as high as 9 percent on Thursday before settling at 8 ~ percent late in the day, up from 8 -RRB- percent late Wednesday The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for short-term loans, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> can influence the level of the rate indirectly by buying or selling government securities in the open market. Some traders concluded that when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> failed to do so at its traditional midday juncture, while the federal funds rate was trading at 8 -RCB- percent, that the central bank had indeed tightened its credit polciy. But others were not convinced. They noted that Thursday was a corporate tax payment deadline and said that may have resulted in a drain on bank reserves, forcing banks to borrow money. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubts the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` is going to tighten in a clear, noticeable way.'' `` I do n't see any reason to do it. The economy has shown we can get a suprising amount of growth without inflation and I do n't think the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- board of governors wants to stand in the way of that,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, interest rates on 52-week <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose in Thursday's auction to the highest level for such a sale in 3 -LCB- years. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 9.0 billion of the bills at an average discount rate of 8.49 percent, up from 7.92 percent at the last auction on Nov. 17 and the highest since 9.24 percent on March 14, 1985. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues, prices of short-term government issues were down 3-32 point, intermediate governments fell 1-16 point and 20-year issues lost 1-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.68 to 1,129.78. In corporate trading, industrials were down. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.83 to 292.95. In the tax-exempt market, prices lost 1-16 point, according to the Bond Buyers index of 40 actively-traded municipal issues. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.45 percent while the discount rose 7 basis points to 8.17 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.68 percent as the discount slipped 10 basis points to 8.22 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.16 percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to 8.49 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

 Three people were charged Thursday with defrauding investors in a start-up jewelry company of $ 640,000 in a case involving a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm already under scrutiny by federal authorities, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said. Stock of the jewelry company, <ORGANIZATION> Renaissance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, was underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Monarch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a 1985 civil lawsuit charged Monarch, its president, an employee and two others with manipulating the stock of two <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, companies. The action was put on hold until January while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> conducts an overlapping criminal investigation, said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An indictment unsealed Thursday accused <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, 29, his wife <PERSON> Annabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaverria </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, of conspiracy, interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained stockholders' funds and income tax violations. The indictment was returned May 20. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> was president of Renaissance, Mrs. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> was vice president and <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON> was an officer of Intercoastal Affiliates, a company that dealt with Renaissance, the indictment said. It said they used several means to siphon off funds from the offering, including making checks payable to accounts under different names controlled by <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> and under his wife's maiden name. They allegedly used $ 18,500 to buy personal jewelry. Phony loans were made to companies created by the defendants, the indictment said. The defendants could not be reached for comment. The Wynns have an unpublished telephone number and <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON> had no listing in <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON> just unequivocably denies any criminal wrongdoing in any of these matters,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Groot </PERSON>. He said the government had strung together innocent business activities to create a fiction of wrongdoing. <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON> has a `` history of working in the banking industry'' and is a well-known business consultant, the lawyer said. An attorney for the Wynns, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, could not be reached. He did not return a phone message. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, chief of the frauds division, said the lag in unsealing the indictment was because of a continuing investigation. <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON> was convicted in federal court in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in April for conspiring to prepare false income tax returns for a reputed captain in the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> crime family, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Attanasio </PERSON>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordenbrook </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. That case is on appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charged penny-stock underwriter Monarch, which maintains its innocence, with illegally inflating the stock in 1982 and 1983 of <ORGANIZATION> Toxic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a hazardous waste cleanup company, and <ORGANIZATION> Liquidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business consulting firm for distressed companies. In November 1987, a former Wall Street analyst was sentenced to eight years in prison by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> for writing falsely positive reports on the companies while having a financial interest in them. Thursday's indictment said the Wynns and <PERSON> LaMagra </PERSON>, through false claims and a false prospectus, caused Monarch to make `` false representations to induce the public to invest'' in Renaissance. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the defendants face at least 50 years in jail each if convicted of all the charges. They were not arrested and no court appearance was set.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and two employees pleaded innocent Thursday to federal charges of padding the cost of a battlefield computer system by $ 10 million. GE, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, and the two employees are charged with hiding savings negotiated with subcontractors in a $ 270 million Army contract to make the computer system. The two employees are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` The government alleges in essence that their materials and subcontractor costs were inflated and the defendants and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> knew it,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbist </PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney prosecuting the case. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, said the company would stand by the statement it released at the time of the indictments. In that statement, the company labeled the charges `` unfair and unfounded.'' The company also said that an internal investigation into the same matter showed pricing discrepancies totaling $ 3.69 million, which the company already has refunded. In May 1985, GE pleaded guilty to unrelated contract-fraud charges, paying a $ 1.04 million fine and reimbursing the government $ 800,000. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Undercofler </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the lawyer representing GE, said the innocent pleas were entered in a brief hearing before federal magistrate <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naythons </PERSON>. A trial date for the current charges was set for Feb. 13. <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> were released on their own recognizance under a $ 250,000 bond. As part of the release agreement, the two men surrendered their passports and agreed to restrict their travel to the eastern district of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harbist </PERSON> said. The 321-count indictment, released Nov. 29, charges that the scheme was conducted through <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s wholly-owned subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION> MATSCO </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>. GE was awarded a $ 250 million contract in June 1983 to make the `` decentralized automated service support system,'' called the DAS-3, for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. According to the indictment, the company and the two employees lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about the prices <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was paying for parts and raw materials and double-billed for some materials.

<HEAD>ConAgra's Profit Up 17 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said its earnings rose 17 percent in the second quarter and were up 21 percent for the first half of fiscal 1989, propelled by strength in poultry and prepared foods businesses. The food processing conglomerate said second-quarter earnings were a record $ 87.4 million, or 71 cents a share, on sales of $ 2.81 billion. That compares with earnings of $ 74.5 million, or 61 cents a share, on sales of $ 2.30 billion in last year's second quarter. For the first half, earnings were $ 145.5 million, or $ 1.19 a share, on sales of $ 5.58 billion. That compares with earnings of $ 120.2 million, or 98 cents a share, on sales of $ 4.71 billion in the same period last year. The company said its prepared foods segment had a substantial profit gain in the second quarter and first half, led by an increase in poultry earnings. Other strong performers were turkey products, consumer frozen foods, agricultural products and grain processing and trading units. Fresh red meat earnings were below last year's levels, but losses in the Armour processed meat unit narrowed in the first half, the company said. `` Record second-quarter and first-half results are particularly satisfying in light of the tough business environment,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. `` In addition to intense competition, our businesses were challenged by higher and volitile ingredient costs caused by the drought,'' he said.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Thursday to temporarily restore to corporations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> a weapon to fight hostile takeover attempts by other companies. The measure validating the use of so-called `` poison pills'' was approved 129-0 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and 52-0 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and sent to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s desk. The legislation, a product of negotiations involving the governor's office, is expected to quickly be signed into law by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The measure is designed to undo until April 1, 1989, the result of a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling earlier this year in which a poison pill that <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tried to use to fend off a hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was ruled illegal. That court decided <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state laws prohibit the inequitable treatment of shareholders. That cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition and raised concerns among the more than 100 companies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that have poison pill rules in place as protection against hostile suitors. Under the poison pill scenario, a target company gives shareholders the right to buy additional stock at reduced prices when an outside party buys up a certain percentage of the company's shares That makes it far more expensive for a suitor to buy enough stock to get a controlling interest in the target company. The poison pill is designed chiefly to give a company time to fend off an unfriendly takeover, if it chooses, or to negotiate a better price for its shareholders if it goes along with a buyout offer. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the bill, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schermerhorn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Orange </LOCATION>, said the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> originally favored validating the poison pills for 18 months, but he said that time period was reduced due to opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. A special task force made up of business leaders and others is in charge of studying the use of poison pills and other aspects of the merger and acquisition field and will report to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> by early spring. Schermerhorn said he'd been told there were `` billions of dollars out there'' that could be used in acquisitions and that some effort must be made to head off the wholesale buying and selling of companies. State. Sen. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Leichter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Democrat who voted for the measure, said poison pills are sometimes used by corporate management to `` keep itself in control.'' He said that can lead to what he called abuses. `` Poison pills really are a way of changing the rules in the middle of a game,'' he said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Leasing Violated Antitrust Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that the leasing of two corn wet milling plants in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniels-Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The government had claimed in a suit filed in December 1982 that the lease created an unreasonable restraint of trade because it would give <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> a large enough share of the high fructose corn syrup -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- market to control the price of the product. In the early 1970s, new technology allowed the processing by wet corn milling plants of certain corn syrups into a substitute for sugar in sweetening various products, including canned fruits and soft drinks. The suit noted that since 1934 sugar cane and beet sugar growers have benefitted from either direct subsidies or sugar price supports enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Because of the price supports, the price of <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> has been substantially lower than the price of sugar for many years. The government presented evidence that if the lease between <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> was consummated, <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> would be able, because of its newly established market position, to raise the price of <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> to a level just below the price of sugar. The companies, however, were granted a summary judgment in the case in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. That court agreed that sugar and <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> are in the same relevant product market, and that <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of that market was not sufficient to constitute a violation of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act In its 2-1 decision Thursday, a panel of the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled, however, that while sugar and <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> are functionally interchangeable, they are not reasonably interchangeable because of the price differential between the two products and therefore are not in the same relevant product market. The majority on the appeals court panel comprised judges <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>. Dissenting was Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who said he agreed with the district court's decision that <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> and sugar belong in the same relevant product market.

 Brewery workers at <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have voted overwhelmingly against union representation by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman for the brewery said Thursday night. Results of the two days of balloting on union representation were announced by <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Crider </PERSON>, a brewery spokeswoman. `` Of the 1,562 eligible workers at the brewery, 1,081 voted against union representation, while 413 voted for the union,'' she said. `` Brewery workers have decided that they do n't want union representation,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, director of community relations for <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>. `` Coors will continue to work to maintain high-quality relationships among its work force without third-party representation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> switched a live telephone in Golden to a recording after the vote was announced. The vote followed 18 months of union and company politicking at the brewery, the nation's fourth largest. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> needed a simple majority to win representation for the 1,600 Coors brewery workers. The brewery has been non-union since December 1978, when workers voted overwhelmingly to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> after a bitter 20-month strike. The strike had been effectively broken and triggered a nationwide organized labor boycott of Coors products. That boycott officially ended in August 1987 with an agreement between Coors and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and including the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. An agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> stipulated that win or lose, there will be no return to the boycott against Coors products. Voting began Wednesday, when 126 brewery workers who had Thursday off voted. It continued at three locations at the brewery on Thursday, said Meadows. Key issues in the election included wages and pensions. The Teamsters have touted the wages recently implemented and the pension plan under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new brewery in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Coors officials have warned employees not to count on those wage and pension levels even if the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> win, saying <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> is four times as large as <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> and can afford salaries and benefits that <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> can not <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, addressing workers Monday in a series of meetings at the brewery, rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' claims that a union victory would boost sales at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, which last year shipped 15.6 million barrels of beer and expects to sell 17 million barrels this year. Teamsters Brewery Division Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughton </PERSON> has said the union label would make Coors more palatable to many consumers and boost sales as much as 10 percent. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a beer industry analyst in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said the vote wo n't affect Coors sales one way or another. `` A non-union workforce is going to cost the company some business. Similarly, a union workforce could cost some sales. The question is: Is it a significant amount of business?'' he asked. The election was being conducted independently of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, an experienced labor arbitrator, was acting as the independent monitor. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter beer shipments of 5.57 million barrels, up 8.1 percent from the same period a year earlier, and net earnings for the period of $ 21.64 million, up marginally from a year earlier.
