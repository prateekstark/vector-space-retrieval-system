 A jury ruled Friday that <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON> was negligent but did not assault or beat a passport clerk who claimed the entertainer attacked her in 1985, and both women said they were pleased with the verdict. The jury refused to award any money for pain and suffering, emotional distress or punitive damages, but it assessed Miss <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON> $ 20,500 for the year's salary the clerk lost and her medical bills. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Polik </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON>, 44, for $ 6 million, claiming that the entertainer ripped out her hair, slapped her and `` banged and bashed'' her head on a counter top after she told her she had the wrong photos for a passport and that she needed the $ 35 fee in exact change. `` I'm very happy,'' <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON> said. `` I've been vindicated and I'm glad the situation has been resolved.'' `` Ms. <PERSON> Polik </PERSON> was looking for a $ 6 million gold mine and instead she's back to where she was in 1985 _ working for a living like everybody else,'' added <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Polik </PERSON> also said she was pleased with the verdict. `` No human being has the right to beat up on another,'' she said. <PERSON> Polik </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, said she considered the verdict a victory for Polik. `` I am thrilled,'' she said. `` The jury found Ms. <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON> negligent. They said that intentionally or unintentionally she did what she was accused of and ordered her to pay for medical expenses and loss of earnings.'' <PERSON> Polik </PERSON>, 27, said she suffered pinched neck nerves, headaches, dizziness and nausea following the July 8, 1985, attack.

<TEXT>
 Socialist parties have agreed to back Christian Democrat <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> to form a united front for <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s opposition in presidential elections set for December. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the general whose military government has ruled this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation since a 1973 coup, has said he will not run for the presidency but will remain as commander of the army. The army on Friday threatened `` the use of legitimate force'' if needed to keep <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as its commander after the elections. Leaders of the pro-socialist <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and two major factions of the divided <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held ceremonies Friday to announce their support of <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 70. `` It's not just a president we are going to elect,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, head of the Party for Democracy. `` We are going to elect the man who will rebuild a democratic system trampled by a dictatorship.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, predicted victory in the Dec. 14 election. His centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> form <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s largest political party. `` I'm sure we will triumph,'' he said in a speech accepting the socialists' support. `` I'm sure we will have a government of democratic reconstruction.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had been expected to run for president, but legal experts said the constitution, written by his military government, barred him because of a clause prohibiting a president from seeking re-election. Last Tuesday, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> publicly declared he would not be a candidate, but he also said he would not relinquish command of the powerful army. Conservative and pro-Pinochet groups are split over possible candidates. The main contenders are <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarpa </PERSON>, leader of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renovation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and former Finance Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s choice but has not agreed to run. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists and Party for Democragy are the major forces in a 17-party opposition coalition. A coalition leader, <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> would be formally nominated on July 4. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other far-left parties that are outside the coalition have said they will not present an opponent to <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> but will run their own candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Coalition members have been negotiating on a single slate of candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said his platform will include the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the years of military rule. He called rights abuses `` an open wound that will not heal until the truth is discovered.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> scheduled the election after voters, in a referendum last October, overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal that the general remain in power until 1997. The elected government is to be installed March 11, 1990, with the president serving a four-year term. The constitution bars the new president from replacing any of the existing armed forces commanders for up to eight years. A statement by the army command in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> said Friday it has the `` mission of safeguarding the constitutional order, either through representations or, in their absence, through the use of legitimate force.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which crushed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement, is expected to play an increasingly important role in civilian politics. It was lack of army support that doomed Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> when he challenged senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s condemnation of student protesters for a freer society. Now that at least 150,000 soldiers are stationed in and around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to enforce martial law, cultivating the army will be a necessity for any replacement for <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and prospective successor to the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. Which way the army will throw its support and whether it will stand united behind one candidate have become key questions, but most foreign diplomats and military experts say they can do little more than guess. One problem is that normal diplomatic and military contacts have been interrupted by the fighting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Outsiders have been reduced to watching which generals appear on television and reading between the lines in their speeches. Another is that the military stands outside the political dichotomy of liberals and conservatives defined by their stands on the speed of economic reform and degree of cultural freedom. The military has its own priorities, including stability and maintaining a political atmosphere in which the army has high status. Political initiatives are unlikely to come from the rank and file, many of whom are illiterate and subjected to heavy propaganda. Young officers with relatively liberal educations might support reformers such as <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> but have little power. The key players will be senior officers in their 50s and 60s who owe their positions to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and are desirous of promotion and national stability. By and large, the conservatives seem to meet their interests best right now, although long-term stability under a leadership that continues to repress the citizenry is dubious. In the latest move, army propaganda chief <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaze </PERSON> took over as editor in chief of the party's official newspaper, the People's Daily The paper said today that <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenrui </PERSON>, who resigned for health reasons. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s problems with the military began well before weeks of student protests for which he expressed sympathy threw the party leadership into crisis. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rising `` young'' generation of leaders in their 50s and 60s who, unlike <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and those in their 80s, were not army officers in the pre-1949 civil war and World War II. Their rise was interpreted as part of a natural evolution from the heavily ideological politics of a revolutionary leadeship toward a more pragmatic and even technocratic government style. But the status and budget of the military eroded steadily under the new leaders as funds were shifted from defense to economic development. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> approved the shift, but it appears <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> took the blame. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s personal power base was in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in which he served as political commissar during the 1930s and 1940s when it fought the Nationalist government and Japanese invaders. He made <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> a vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which he heads and which sets military policy. The army reportedly remained lukewarm toward <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who was more comfortable meeting diplomats and playing golf than visiting the troops. When <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> cast his vote against a crackdown on the protesters and publicly blamed the growing chaos on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, not one army official rose to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s support, according to foreign diplomats. There clearly was opposition to orders to shoot the crowd protecting the students. Some units sat on the sidelines throughout the battling and never joined in. There were reports, never confirmed, of individual soldiers or small groups firing on other soldiers who shot civilians. But there were no reports of units opposing the political shakeup or contemplating an anti-Deng coup. Clues in the official media indicate <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s candidate to succeed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, a member of the party's top decision-making group. He also lacks a military background, but he may have an alternative acceptable to the senior officers: he is believed in charge of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal secret service, and at one point was reported to oversee the people's armed police, which has links to the army. There are no indications the army is preparing to throw up its own candidate. The military has not put forward a political candidate since Marshal <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Piao </PERSON> fell from grace as <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s prospective heir in 1971 after allegedly plotting a coup One lesson may be drawn from the army's performance of the past few weeks. Even in the face of the hardest choice many soldiers probably have ever had to make _ to disobey orders or to shoot at people who had been giving them drinks and food for days as they sat parked in trucks around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> _ discipline and unity prevailed. When it comes time to rally behind a successor to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the army likely will act as one.

<HEAD>Memo Stirs Flap over City Councilman's Overalls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHWOOD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pair of worn, faded overalls has caused a flap at City Hall where the mayor wants a councilman to pay more attention to his appearance. After Councilman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> showed up recently at a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> workshop in overalls, Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> issued a memo asking councilmen to dress properly when representing <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION>, a small town about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The memo mentions no names, but <PERSON> Head </PERSON> said it was directed at <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>. His memo does not ban jeans but asks that they be clean and in good shape. `` While I'm sure that faded overalls and T-shirts are comfortable, I feel that they have no place in the council chambers,'' Head wrote. `` Hell will freeze over before I let anyone tell me how to dress,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. `` It's nobody's business how a person dresses. If someone wants to come down there in rags, that's his business.'' He intends to wear his overalls to the July 11 council meeting. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, 54, said he has only worn overalls once since being elected in May, and that was because he did n't have time to change after taking care of some goats at his farm. But <PERSON> Head </PERSON> said <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> has shown up at City Hall wearing T-shirts with holes around the neck, and cares little about his appearance when representing the city. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> lost an election to Head in 1988 but won a council post by a slim margin as a write-in candidate in May. Head, 50, stepped down from his council post to run unopposed for mayor in May.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders say newly declassified Pentagon figures on the cost of the B-2 stealth bomber bolster their argument against spending for the costly program. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has produced a B-2 program that wo n't fly financially,'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday after the estimates were `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are balking at spending $ 4.1 billion this year for SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB-,'' he said. `` It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much per year on a plane.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the radar-evading plane will cost about $ 24 billion over a three-year peak spending period. The estimated cost for the bomber in fiscal 1990 is $ 4.7 billion, including $ 2 billion in research, development, testing and evaluation and $ 2.7 billion in production. Estimated costs in fiscal 1991 total $ 5.3 billion with costs in peak years of fiscal 1992 at $ 7.8 billion, fiscal 1993 at $ 8.4 billion and fiscal 1994 at $ 7.7 billion. Recent estimates have shown the aircraft will cost between $ 500 million and $ 650 million a copy. The figures released Friday showed the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has invested about $ 22.4 billion in the program and total cost to complete the project would be about $ 70 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to purchase 132 of the planes, including three in fiscal 1990, five in fiscal 1991, 10 in fiscal 1992, 21 in fiscal 1993 and 24 in fiscal 1994. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel who had called for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to publicly release the cost figures on the aircraft, said publication of the figures means will make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take an even closer look `` I was shocked at the amount of money,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` This early on we will look at it with more care and more scrutiny.'' The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets Tuesday and will take up the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act. Opposition to the aircraft has grown in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with lawmakers arguing that production should be suspended because the bomber has yet to undergo flight testing. In an appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a former astronaut and test pilot, said pursuing production of the bomber violates the rule `` fly before buy.'' The bomber program has been `` buy it, and then we'll see how it flies,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said in a letter to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>. The defense secretary, at a hearing Thursday, indicated initial tests of the aircraft would be conducted by the end of the summer. In his fiscal 1990 budget, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had proposed pushing back production of the B-2 a year to 1993. In response to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s criticism, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said this week that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is `` thinks the B-2's long-range capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an important strategic asset to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` So, he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed his strong support for the B-2 program,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Child Care Bill; Fight Shifts To House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of an unprecedented child-care package sends the debate to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where Republicans and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration promise to fight anew for a plan without the billion-dollar subsidies being pushed by Democrats. `` We've made a significant step toward providing affordable, safe care for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children and equal economic opportunity for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said Friday just before the measure passed on a voice vote. With $ 1.75 billion in direct subsidies for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and more than $ 2 billion a year in tax credits, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> package represents the greatest government effort ever to address child-care needs of working parents and its first major effort since an emergency plan adopted during World War II. Action on child care is expected to accelerate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week, and Republicans vowed to fight for legislation far different from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. `` This is just a first step and a very short step,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to encourage the administration not to view what happened in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as final.'' With the White House raising the possibility of a veto, Democrats too said they hoped to strike a compromise, although they are not willing to abandon the subsidy approach. `` We are quite willing to hear the administration, to listen to their suggestions and their recommendations,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. It appeared early Friday that partisan bickering would threaten a two-week <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recess. But Republicans, after losing several attempts to significantly change the Democratic bill, relented and struck a deal with majority Democrats on a timetable to end the debate. Only a handful of senators remained when the measure passed. The leadership had agreed to the voice vote so those lawmakers who had to catch flights out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would not be recorded as absent for the vote. Democrats characterized the legislation as historic and a long-overdue effort to support low-income parents who must work but can not find affordable child care. `` The real winners, the children, are closer to a safer, more effective and affordable child-care program,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The measure was the product of an unusual alliance between liberal Democrat <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, whose conservative credentials helped Democrats brush aside many <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attacks on the plan. `` This is a monumental achievement,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Despite changes designed to accommodate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the measure contained `` nothing for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added that despite the addition of provisions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored, the bill remained `` a candidate for a veto.'' In addition to the $ 1.75 billion authorization for child-care subsidies, the measure includes three tax-relief provisions designed to help low - and moderate-income families pay for child care and health insurance for their children One would supplement the existing Earned Income Tax Credit to provide up to $ 750 more for parents whose annual incomes are less than $ 10,000 and have two or more children under age 5. Parents could receive a $ 500 credit for one eligible child. The second tax-related provision allows those who qualify for the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit to get 90 percent of their credit up front, a move designed to give cash to families who are eligible for the credit but can not take advantage of it because they do n't make enough to owe federal taxes The third provision, which Republicans vigorously opposed, would provide parents with annual incomes of less than $ 12,000 with a tax credit of to $ 500 to pay 50 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their children.

I'd say yes,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a builder in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, with several <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects who has given generously. `` It's perceived as the cost of doing business with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the current political climate,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authorities </ORGANIZATION>. It is a violation of the federal ethics code to use `` public office or official title for private gain,'' even if the money goes to charity, according to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Erotic Department Store remains open for business today, its supposedly `` sizzling'' saleswomen talking sex by phone under no less an authority than the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Their tape-recorded portrayals of sexual encounters _ part of a multibillion-dollar business known as dial-a-porn _ were ruled constitutional, within some restrictions, by a unanimous high court Friday. The decision, based on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, rejected a federal law that sought to ban telephone pornography outright. Obscene messages can be banned, the court said, but simply `` indecent'' ones can not. `` It's fantastic. The First Amendment will not be put down,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and a leading dial-a-porn entrepreneur. `` We feel very triumphant.'' But telephone pornography opponents claimed victory, too. `` Many, many of these messages are obscene,'' said <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsil </PERSON>, lawyer for the Children's Legal Campaign in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. As such, he said, they fall under the remaining ban. The debate began in 1983, when the court-ordered breakup of the telephone company gave independent companies the right to operate information services. Callers pay the fee, usually up to a few dollars, on their phone bill. In exchange, they can hear women, or men, make suggestive comments. The problem: Curious children were calling the numbers umpteen times, racking up enormous phone bills. Parents were not amused. Neither were organizations such as <PERSON> Munsil </PERSON>'s, which has been mounting lobbying and courtroom campaigns to have dial-a-porn banned as a corrupting influence on minors. `` There's no way to discriminate between adults and children in the listening audience,'' said <PERSON> Munsil </PERSON>. `` And it's quite clear that these messages are harmful to children.'' Beyond citing protections of free speech, Ms. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> pointed to dial-a-porn's financial success as evidence that it meets community standards of acceptability. `` At its peak, a number of years ago, we were getting half a million calls a day,'' she said. While Ms. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said her business is off dramatically _ down to perhaps 5,000 calls a day _ she attributes that to a proliferation of competitors, not any lessened interest in sex talk. `` There are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in every city,'' she said. `` This stuff has really taken off, on a mom-and-pop basis.'' But a source in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> speaking on condition of anonymity said many of the dial-a-porn services appear to have corporate links. The opportunity for profit is great; all that's required is a contract with the local phone company for an information service number _ often given under the `` 976'' exchange _ a switchboard capable of handling many calls at once, and women and men willing to be recorded making suggestive words and noises. Some of the services provide live telephone contacts. Although complete figures have n't been compiled, court records say 180 million dial-a-porn calls were placed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has 204 separate dial-a-porn services, making up 25 percent of its information service numbers. Nationwide, the industry did an estimated $ 2 billion in business last year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to look into restricting dial-a-porn in 1983, and last year the federal lawmakers decided to ban the services outright. Although the court rejected the ban on messages that are only `` indecent,'' other restrictions are possible. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, said the commission likely will revive a plan to require access codes, scrambled messages or credit card payment for dial-a-porn. The principle is that children, lacking the codes, unscramblers or credit cards, could not make the calls. Other steps are possible. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> will cut off 976 access to customers who request it, and 800,000 have done so. And the ban on obscene messages remains in effect, although the difference between obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to draw. `` I do n't believe that what we do is obscene,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` And if it is, it's yet to be proven.''

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inquiries about the sale of the Malayan Railway for 37 cents continue to pour in from abroad, the transport ministry said today. The minister, <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> <PERSON> Liong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sik </PERSON>, told reporters no decision has been made on a buyer of the railway because the government Economic Planning Unit was still evaluating recommendations by <ORGANIZATION> Bumiputra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on the privatization of the railway. There are no private railways in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Officials said Japanese, Canadians and Americans were among those who were serious about buying the railway, which has about 1,000 miles of track and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets, including its rolling stock, land, buildings and trucks. It also has debts of about $ 407 million. Eighteen months ago, the government announced it planned to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Malayan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> for one ringgit, or 37 cents, as part of plans to privatize many state companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Telecommuncations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, ports and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> board.

 White House aides gave broad assurances <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was receiving relevant documents in the Iran-Contra affair, even though the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had little involvement in reviewing the material, says a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report. The report issued Friday says lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nields </PERSON> did n't learn until August 1987 that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel had n't been involved in reviewing for relevancy the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel's office had relied entirely on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. ` He expressed his outrage at this, since he did not view this as sufficient compliance'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' requests, said the report. `` The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> representatives repeated their contention that the Committees had, in fact, been given all the relevant documents in North' office.'' The 51-page study concludes that ` White House aides made repeated and broad assurances ... that they were receiving all White House documents that were relevant. ... The White House staff, in fact, had no way of knowing if other documents'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needed were n't being selected The intelligence panel issued the report after looking into the handling of documents after six important memos were produced at the trial of North which the investigators had either not seen or seen in different versions. The process of getting documents was `` very, very haphazard'' and `` fairly chaotic,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. `` We have a situation where there's a lot of fault to go around on all sides,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the intelligence committee. He was a member of the congressional panel which investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987. The committee found no evidence to suggest that the documents, relating to an arrangement under which <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would support the Nicaraguan Contras in exchange for expedited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, had been `` deliberately and systematically withheld by the White House.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, D-Okla., the committee chairman, said he could `` never rule out completely'' the possibility that someone could have removed documents from certain files to prevent finding them in any of several searches One key memo, a Feb. 19, 1985, message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> missed during document searches, turned up last month in a box of papers at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The battered tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was pulled cautiously toward <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, leaving behind stained shorelines and angry feelings from the nation's worst oil spill. `` I must say we're not sorry to see it go,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The 987-foot vessel was stopped briefly for a scheduled look at its hull, and video cameras were used to ensure that the punctured hull was sound before the damaged ship was towed into the often stormy Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> en route to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> drydock and more than $ 25 million in repairs. The 2,500-mile trip is expected to take about 20 days. The Exxon Valdez rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, dumping almost 11 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into the waters of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. After the accident, authorities pumped the remaining oil from the ship into other tankers. The spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiled hundreds of miles of coastline. It also dealt a severe blow to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s $ 2 billion fishing industry, forcing officials to ban, postpone or restrict fishing. The vessel unceremoniously lifted anchor Friday and came under tow behind two 7,000-horsepower ocean-going tugboats. A third tug was attached to the tanker's stern. A salvage boat trailed not far behind. Two escort vessels loaded with 9,000 feet of containment boom and each carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4,000 barrels' capacity brought up the rear. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON>, skipper of the Journeyman out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, posted a hand-lettered sign on the side of his boat as he ushered the Exxon Valdez away. `` Thanks a lot Exxon,'' the sign said. Speaking by radio to a nearby media vessel, <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> said fishing closures have hurt: `` It's disrupted my life; it's disrupted our industry.'' Progress initially was slow, and the tanker moved only about two miles in the first two hours, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. The speed is expected to increase to about 5 mph. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> said a light film of oil was reported on the water near the tanker as it got under way. The source of the sheen was unclear, she said, adding not much oil is necessary to make a sheen. `` We're talking pints, not gallons,'' she said. Seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for the trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, officials said. The skeleton crew will monitor air pressure in the vessel's cargo tanks, conduct inspections and be ready to help with the ship's engines should the vessel run into trouble <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have been criticized for their slow handling of the spill during its first few days. Today, oil with a sludge-like consistency can be found 700 miles from the reef. The tanker's former captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, has pleaded innocent to three felony counts of criminal mischief and misdemeanors, including negligent discharge of pollutants and operating a vessel while drunk. He is free on $ 50,000 bail.

<HEAD>Outgoing Social Security Chief Says Public Confidence Restored</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> says she is stepping down as head of Social Security satisfied the agency she modernized and streamlined, sometimes in the face of sharp congressional criticism, is in good shape. But she warns that while overall public confidence in the program is justifiably high, policies using Social Security Trust Funds to underwrite other government programs and reduce the federal budget deficit are `` fueling a lack of confidence'' in the program by younger workers. `` Social Security continues to be misunderstood, by beneficiaries, taxpayers and elected officials alike, and most younger workers do not trust that the government will preserve Social Security for their ` Golden Years,''' she said in her letter of resignation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said she has confidence in the future of the Social Security program, `` but that's not to say everybody does.'' And, she said, many workers are `` discouraged'' by a provision covering the working elderly that withholds $ 1 for every $ 2 they earn over $ 8,880 a year, a provision she has worked to repeal. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, 42, had sought to remain in the <LOCATION> Social </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Security </LOCATION> post she has held for three years, but told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration indicated to her she would be replaced. The administration is expected to nominate <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a former legislative aide to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., who later headed the office of Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> when he was governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said she will leave July 31, and plans to host a weekly, syndicated television program about finances and explore other options in the private sector. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s tenure was marked by efforts to streamline and modernize the agency despite declines in staffing, but critics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said service at the agency has deteriorated. Among the criticisms against her was that new services she introduced have been implemented poorly and resulted in worse service to the public. For example, a toll-free telephone service to provide information to individuals on their benefits has come under fire for a high rate of busy signals and inaccurate information is given to callers. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee earlier this year asked whether Social Security was violating privacy rights through its practice, since halted, of verifying millions of Social Security numbers for private companies engaged in checking credit ratings. And a House Government Operations subcommittee in March began an inquiry into whether <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> combined business trips with vacations and political campaigning for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the Special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and one of <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s harshest critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped new leadership `` can recapture the original spirit of the agency to provide compassionate service to our most vulnerable citizens. But <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the agency now has a plan that will lead a solvent trust fund into the next century, and `` the vast majority of the public is very pleased with the service Social Security provides.'' A trust fund that was considered shaky before she took office now has enough money to pay benefits until at least the middle of the next century, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> report in April. She takes credit for modernizing the agency's massive computer operations, launching the 800 telephone service and providing to all workers Social Security benefit estimates upon request. `` All this has been accomplished despite an imposed 20 percent decrease in staffing,'' in which 63,000 jobs were eliminated through attrition, she said. When she was named to head Social Security by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1986, she became the first woman to head the agency. She worked for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on welfare issues when he was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and she was an assistant secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> during his first presidential term before being named to the Social Security post.

<HEAD>Senators Suggest Withholding Salvador Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Some senators are impatient with what they see as slow progress toward peace in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and believe a cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid could promote a settlement with leftist guerrillas. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top official for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, says a sharp aid reduction would play into the hands of extremists and increase violence. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> testified Friday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, making his congressional debut as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Most senators at the hearing expressed opposition to administration policy, asserting that $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in less than a decade had produced minimal progress. They noted the civil war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> continues and argued the activities of rightist death squads are on the increase. Sens. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said they would seek legislation requiring that 50 percent of the $ 85 million military aid planned for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> be withheld for six months The money will be released only if the administration certified the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government is making progress toward a settlement with leftist guerrillas. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said a number of Salvadorans identified with death squad activities who had lowered their profile for a time are now back in the `` good graces'' of the rightist ARENA party, which took over the government three weeks ago after its electoral victory in March. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., described <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a `` costly, bloody failure'' and said a new policy for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in particular is needed But <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> warned against suspending aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> because it would cost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence with the government. At least twice during the hearing he cited the precedent of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, recalling that after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military ties to that nation were suspended in 1977 under President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> there was a marked increase in the number of political killings. In the absence of a restraining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence, he said, the Guatemalan military `` killed everybody in sight.'' <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a Democrat with a conservative foreign policy outlook, was treated more respectfully by the subcommittee than his predecessor, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who alienated many lawmakers with his combative approach. But <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> took strong exception to a statement by <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> that the administration `` closes its eyes and ears to the threat from the right'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> said admonitions to Salvadoran leaders for improvement in the protection of human rights are carried frequently by administration officials. He challenged assertions by Democrats on the panel that administration policy has produced no gains in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He noted that despite the lack of a democratic tradition in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, five national elections have been held since 1982 and that politically motivated killings have dropped sharply over the years.

<HEAD>NHTSA Releases New Crash-Test Results</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal engineers say crash tests of 19 cars show drivers of the Chevrolet Astro Van have the greatest chance of head injury in an accident. The van's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the federal tests are n't a valid indicator of crash-worthiness. The Astro Van was among 12 vehicles listed in the third round of crash-test results released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The vehicles were tested under <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s program to provide consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 vehicles Results of seven other vehicles had been released previously. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said the federal test results `` do not reflect the actual safety performance of these vehicles on the road'' because the test is done on only one vehicle. The vehicles were smashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier, and the stresses that resulted were measured by sensors on human-shaped dummies protected by seat belts or other crash-protection devices. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called the head injury criterion. The higher the index, the greater the likelihood of injury. The Astro Van crash test produced a head injury criterion of 1,849 for the driver-side dummy in the Astro Van, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The figure was more than double the head injury criterion recorded in a test of the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> van, the only other van tested this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> had a head injury criterion of 805, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Federal regulations require cars on the market to produce a head injury criterion no greater than 1,000 in tests conducted by the automakers. The public tests done by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> and the mandatory tests to meet safety regulations are not considered comparable because the automakers' tests are done at 30 mph. Other new test results by weight class produced these driver head injury criteria: _ Subcompact cars: Mercury Tracer 4-door hatchback, 940 _ Compact cars: <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Probe 2-door hatchback, 970 _ Large and mid-size cars: Chevrolet Caprice 4-door sedan, 1,328; <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Fifth Avenue 4-door sedan, 786; Eagle Premier 4-door sedan, 877; <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> 4-door sedan, 863; and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION> 4-door sedan, 663 _ Trucks, vans and multi-purpose vehicles: Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, 834; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, 994; and Jeep Cherokee, 968 <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said small differences in test results are n't considered significant. Previously released test results, by weight class, were: _ Subcompact: <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> 2-door hatchback, 399; <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Civic CRX 2-door hatchback, 750; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> Mirage 4-door sedan, 960 _ Compact: <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> Galant 4-door sedan, 971 _ Large and mid-size: <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> 4-door sedan, 1,421; Eagle Medallion 4-door sedan, 745; Ford Thunderbird 2-door, 541

 Congressional leaders are pressing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for tough action against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is appealing for patience, saying it will be a long time before <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> return to normal relations. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a meeting with senators Friday, asked for `` their understanding that he was trying to do the best job possible to express the concerns of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, the outrage of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in terms of what they had seen there, and at the same time, to preserve our relations as best we could.'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Del </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` asked for our patience and forbearance.'' Chinese authorities this week executed 27 people charged with taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, calls continued for a stronger <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> response. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said: `` I believe the president must take tough action and block trade with and new investments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> right now He added that `` there are some values which take precedence over commerce.'' `` The stark barbarism of the communist regime is unforgivable to all civilized people,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` The dust has settled on the blood of peaceful demonstrators, and the regime wantonly spills fresh blood on top of old. It executes its young on the altar of old men's egos and fears. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not possibly be in the position of rewarding, appearing to reward, or in any way countenance these acts,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who has called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be more forceful in denouncing the Chinese government's actions, attended the White House meeting but did not speak to reporters afterwards At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not suggest lawmakers should mute their criticism of his policy, and `` he made it very clear that he believed that it was appalling what was happening in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in terms of human rights.'' He quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying `` there was a long road that was going to have to be traveled in that relationship and that we should n't move precipitously. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in referring to `` a long road,'' was talking about `` the events that have taken place there, and the amount of time that anyone can foresee before we would have a return to a normalcy or anything like we had before.'' Unlike some of his congressional colleagues, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> withheld criticism or suggestions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy. ` I do n't believe that we should suggest to the president precisely what he should do,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` I think what we should do is make it clear to the president and make it clear to the Chinese that there is n't any option that is beyond consideration.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said, `` I think the president was saying that it's very simple to take a precipitous action, break relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the long-range interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> require delicate, appropriate, judgmental handling of the situation.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the acts of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government against its own citizens `` must be met by an unrelenting and unmistakable willingness to change immediately and significantly the status quo of our relationship. `` The bullets aimed at pro-democracy students, workers and teachers are also aimed at us,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` Each shot that takes a life, when met by silence, indifference or sense of impotence, also takes with it a piece of who we are and what we are supposed to stand for.''

He carries no weapon, only a feather in his right hand. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiteljorg </PERSON> would not have it any other way. `` In this museum you will not see one battle scene,'' said <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION>, whose voluminous private collection becomes public when the museum opens today. `` The Indians had a beautiful art or religion, whatever you want to call it. They worshiped the sun, the rain, their crops and fields. They never killed except for their own needs. I wanted the museum to show that. It has a romantic feeling about the western Indians and their life.'' The museum's collection of primarily 20th century paintings and bronzes chronicles the westward movement of American settlers and the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' way of life. <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION>'s collection is among the best displays of Southwestern art in the nation, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakel </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fame </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` He bought early and he bought well, before the boom in prices,'' he said. The best of the <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION> collection centers on the Taos Ten, a colony of artists founded by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> that settled in <LOCATION> Taos </LOCATION>, N.M. From Sharp's colorful oil `` Taos Indians'' to <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' `` The Blue Shawl,'' each is a memento of <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION>'s many visits to <LOCATION> Taos </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> The collection also includes works by more well-known Western artists such as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>. Other artists featured in the museum are <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, whose watercolors were used to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to create Yellowstone National Park, and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the earliest known artist to paint the American fur traders during their heyday. <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION>, who studied art at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and whose German-born mother was an artist, married the daughter of a southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> coal company owner and later took over the business. The fortune he amassed in coal and real estate allowed him and his second wife, <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON>, to acquire their vast art holdings. It includes an impressive collection of African art and costumes, which will go on permanent display at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in 1990. His Western art, however, was too significant to place within another museum's walls. City and state leaders invited <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION> four years ago to build a museum on the outskirts of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> just west of downtown <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. A $ 12.5 million grant from <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.5 million from <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION> financed its development and construction. The 25,000 square feet of gallery space house a rotating exhibit of <LOCATION> Eiteljorg </LOCATION>'s 240 Western paintings, 149 bronzes and 740 Indian artifacts, mostly from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, Plains and the Northwest Coast Indian cultures. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Duty </PERSON>, the museum's executive director, said his goals include developing the museum into a repository and research facility for <ORGANIZATION> Woodlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, who once roamed <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and surrounding states. `` We must also become spokespersons for trying to protect Indian burial sites, trying to afford them the kind of respect that I think they have not always gotten,'' he said. Perhaps the museum's most significant contribution is the respect it demands of Western paintings and sculptures, long considered the backwater of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art, Duty said. `` Western imagery is so pervasive in advertising, movies and television that people find it hard not to get the two confused,'' he said. `` Western art has a real place in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has left separate messages for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and sexually oriented telephone services. To Congress: You ca n't kill dial-a-porn. To the multibillion-dollar industry: Clean up your act. The court's unanimous decision Friday said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> went too far last year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented phone message services. Only obscene messages, not messages that merely are `` indecent,'' may be outlawed, the court said. It said a blanket ban would violate free-speech rights. A phone conversation, like an explicit movie or centerfold in an adult magazine, may or may not be obscene. That's for a jury to decide, on a case-by-case basis. Material deemed to be indecent, rather than obscene, is protected under the Constitution. The court acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a legitimate interest in preventing children from being exposed to even indecent messages. But the justices said they are unpersuaded nothing less than a total ban will prevent kids from gaining access to such messages. In other decisions, the court: _ Ruled 5-4 in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial round of appeals _ Said, by an 8-1 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a legal obligation under the Freedom of Information Act to supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax cases _ Made it more difficult, by a 7-2 vote in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case, for older workers to prove their employers are guilty of illegal age bias in the handling of pensions and other fringe benefits In the dial-a-porn case, the court said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to use technology to restrict dial-a-porn messages to adults might work, resulting in `` only a few of the most enterprising and disobedient young people'' gaining access to such messages. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pornography </ORGANIZATION>, urged people to pressure telephone companies to drop dial-a-porn services. The ruling, <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> said, `` gives citizens a chance to really speak out whether they want this stuff in their community.'' The ruling does not directly affect any state's regulation of the dial-a-porn business. But state laws deemed too similar to the federal law could be challenged on the same constitutional grounds. The court rejected industry arguments that the disputed law impermissibly imposes a national standard for what is obscene, based on `` the least tolerant community.'' The argument is that a phone message originating in a city such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which tolerates numerous sexually explicit businesses, could be prosecuted and judged under the community standards of a small town in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The court said that's a problem with which the dial-a-porn industry itself must wrestle. The court's three most liberal justices in freedom-of-expression cases _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ voted to strike down the federal law even as it applies to obscene material. Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers through 976 exchanges. The telephone company typically charges callers according to per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the rest to the dial-a-porn company. The same 976 exchanges also are used for other, non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time checks and weather reports. Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. By 1984, according to court records, some 180 million calls were placed by customers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> alone. The industry reportedly topped $ 2 billion in income last year.

 Activists commemorated the murders 25 years ago of three young civil rights workers by vowing to fight in their spirit to strengthen voter registration and reverse the effects of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on affirmative action. But relatives of the slain workers said they were disappointed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not commit himself to new civil rights legislation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told family members of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, both white New Yorkers, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, a black Mississippian, that the men killed by <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, were `` heroes.'' `` We can erect no greater monument to their memory than to ensure that the arrogance and bigotry that took their lives never again exists in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement released at the White House. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president is waiting for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of the new <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings before making any commitment to action. The families were on a bus caravan from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to commemorate the June 21, 1964 disappearance of the men, who had been conducting a black voter registration drive in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found buried in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found that the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> had killed them. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner-Bender </PERSON>, who was married to <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, told reporters she was disappointed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was noncommittal when they asked him to back bipartisan legislation `` to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cases that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country.'' At a ceremony at the Capitol, she charged the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stand in the way of `` a suitable and fitting memorial'' to those who participated in the civil rights struggle. `` So long as the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argues before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a narrowing of the laws ... so long as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president fail to commit themselves to the needs of the poor, housing, education, medical assistance there is no honor shown to the civil rights participants,'' she said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, brother of the slain <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, told about 300 people in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, `` We have to remember they did n't volunteer to die.'' `` We need immediate passage of federal legislation that eliminates all the barriers to voting,'' <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> said. `` This present majority on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is far more dangerous than <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> with a fire hose,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, city official's actions against civil rights demonstrators. Hooks also vowed legislative remedies to reverse <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. Or, `` we'll have demonstrations that'll make what happen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> look like child's play,'' he said, raising the threat of thousands of protestors converging on the capital.

 An oil tanker hit an offshore rock Friday afternoon and leaked about 1 million gallons of heating oil into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The 560-foot tanker World Prodigy, carrying 7.6 million gallons of No. 2 heating oil, struck a rock at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, immediately south of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, at 4:40 p.m., said Petty Officer <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The ship, bound for <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, was pulled off the rock almost immediately and anchored nearby. The leak was stopped at about 9:10 p.m., after about 1 million gallons of oil had leaked, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began replacing booms around the ship, which sails under a Greek flag, with a containment curtain shortly after 10 p.m. `` They'll determine overnight what the immediate environmental concerns are and place booms around those areas,'' she said. Like a boom, the plastic curtain is deployed around the spill, with its bottom weighted to keep it under water and its top suspended by buoys to contain the oil. Some of the oil was washing up on <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> beaches early Saturday, said Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. He said the ship's captain told him he had made a mistake in not having a pilot on board and also in plotting the course. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and other White House advisers to the scene early Saturday, and they met DiPrete shortly after midnight and planned to tour the affected area. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Markos </PERSON>, <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said state officials are considering legal action, but plan no criminal charges. `` Our bay is very important to us. We're a very small state,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON>, deputy director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> divers had reported finding two huge holes in the ship. `` There's a long 150-foot knifelike gash and divers are now talking about a wider gash lower on the ship,'' <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON> said state officials were confident they had enough booms to contain the spill, and said it was a lucky that the spill was heating oil. `` It's a light fuel oil,'' <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON> said. `` The plus of that is you do n't get the heavy staining or coating or adhesion. It breaks up easier and evaporates.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the slick was moving east, parallel to the shore and away from the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON> said sensitive wildlife areas in the bay could be in danger by morning. `` That tide's going to change on us,'' he said. There were no immediate reports of injuries or harm to wildlife. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the ship is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION>, but did not know who owns the cargo. <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reef </PERSON>, a nautical landmark where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup yacht races were held for many years, is within sight of the shore and of the main shipping route into <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The cause of the accident was not known, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the spill should be a lot easier to contain than the crude oil spill that devastated <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> last winter when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> struck a rock near the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` With any luck at all, the seas are calm enough that we'll be able to boom all around it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Nothing like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where it got out of hand before anyone was there.'' Because the site is in the populous Northeast, it will take much less time to get booms and cleanup equipment into place, he said. The odor of the spilled oil wafted through this affluent resort city. `` Boy, it's enough to knock you off your feet,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, who lives near the shore in suburban <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill occurred March 23, when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, a well-marked navigation hazard about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The 987-foot tanker had just picked up a full load of 11.3 million gallons of oil at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the northernmost ice-free port in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the southern terminus of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline. At one point, the tanker was spilling 20,000 gallons of oil per hour into pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Exxon later fired the tanker's captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, after tests revealed his blood alcohol level was above legal limits more than nine hours after the accident. He faces criminal charges, including reckless endangerment, and operating a vessel while drunk. Exxon later was criticized because no containment booms were put around the tanker until more than 11 hours after the wreck. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially rejected requests by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials to federalize the clean-up efforts, insisting that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> could do the job. But on April 7, he ordered the military to join the clean-up effort.

<TEXT>
 A drift-net fishing agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> averted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embargo of Japanese fishery imports but sparked criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the one-year agreement Friday, days before a June 29 deadline. Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., called the pact disappointing Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said he had `` serious doubts'' about the agreement. `` It certainly is n't the agreement we were looking for,'' said <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think our fishermen had hoped for a lot more.'' `` Piracy of our fish will continue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., also a member of the fisheries panel, pointing to `` evidence of past behavior. The Japanese use the nets for squid. Drift nets are small-mesh nets that can stretch more than 30 miles long, hanging in the water and snaring virtually any mammal, bird or fish that comes in contact. Officials said that on any given day, the nets can cover more than 30,000 miles of ocean. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the nets poses a threat to the marine environment and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing industry. The one-year agreement, confirmed in an exchange of letters between <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> negotiators and the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, calls for some monitoring of the Japanese fishing fleet in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not required to make any commitment about revising or curtailing its use of drift nets. `` This agreement achieves a real commitment, rather than a vague promise, that major advances in Japanese fleet monitoring and enforcement will take place on a multi-year basis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in a statement. `` If this progress is reflected in results, we will have achieved an important balance between our fishing trading relationship and our environmental responsibilities.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that the environmental group was concerned that `` this deal simply is n't going to go far enough in setting the level of observer participation and other measures that would set a foundation for a ban in the future. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, as recently as last month, was unwilling to accept any proposal. He said the settlement was hastened by the threat of trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, on fishery products imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Drift net Act of 1987 gave the <ORGANIZATION> commerce </ORGANIZATION> secretary until June 29 to reach an agreement. Under the agreement, up to four research fishing vessels will be allowed to accompany Japanese fishing fleets, which consist of about 460 vessels. The research vessels _ three from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ will be equipped with transmitters so data can be collected to determine `` who catches what and where,'' <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said. Japanese and American observers also will be placed on Japanese vessels so the location of the vessels can be determined.

<BYLINE>SUBSIDIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The legislation authorizes $ 1.75 billion in federal subsidies for child care in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, money that still must be appropriated. Seventy percent of the money would have to be used to help parents pay for child care. Twenty-two percent is earmarked for state programs such as grants to and training of child-care providers. The remaining 8 percent would be used for states to administer the programs. States which certified that availability of child care was more of a problem than affordability could reduce to 65 percent the amount for parents and increase to 27 percent the amount used on state programs.

<BYLINE>TAX CREDITS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 There are three tax breaks for low-income and moderate-income families: _ Child Health Credit Parents with annual incomes of less than $ 12,000 could receive a tax credit of up to $ 500 to help pay the cost of health insurance for their children. Families with annual incomes of $ 12,000 to $ 18,000 would get a smaller credit. This credit would first be available in 1991. _ <ORGANIZATION> Refundable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dependent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> Beginning in 1992, families who now are eligible for the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit could receive 90 percent of their credit up front through monthly installments in their paychecks. `` Refundable'' means the measure is designed to provide the money to families who are eligible but do not get to take advantage of the credit currently because they do not make enough to owe any federal income taxes against which the credit would be applied. _ Supplemental Earned Income Tax Credit The existing credit would provide families with annual incomes of less than $ 10,000 with a $ 500 credit for a child under the age of 5 and a $ 750 credit if they have two or more eligible children. The credit, available beginning in 1991, would be phased out for families with annual incomes in the $ 10,000 - $ 15,000 range

<BYLINE>REGULATIONS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 States are encouraged to adopt health and safety standards in line with guidelines included in the measure. These include first-aid and other training of child-care providers and inspections of institutional child-care settings. Immediate family members of children who provide child care for them are exempt from any state training requirements. Also, Social Security recipients would have any child-care earnings exempted from outside earnings limitations.

<BYLINE>CHURCH PROVIDERS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The bill allows federal subsidies to pay for child care at church-run centers but prohibits the use of the funds for any purposes inconsistent with the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state.

<HEAD>FAA Halts Spread Of Distance Between Airliner Exit Doors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is taking action to stop airline manufacturers from placing exit doors too far apart. The Association of Flight Attendants praised Friday's order, which limits doors to within 60 feet apart, saying it will stop <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plans to remove middle doors over the wings of future jumbo jets. But a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, said the aircraft builder already has abandoned any plans that would put exit doors in its planes further than 60 feet apart. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said its order will `` hold the line'' on the growth of distances between airliner exit doors, noting that one unidentified model was planned with exits more than 80 feet apart. The new regulations published in Friday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> take effect in 30 days and apply to `` all newly manufactured airplanes of older type designs after Oct. 16, 1987,'' when the rule was first proposed, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The rule also will prevent any modification of existing designs that would increase the distance between doors beyond 60 feet and prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines from using foreign airplanes that have exit distances exceeding the new standard, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it is forming an advisory committee to set standards based on how quickly passengers can exit from the doors rather than on arbitrary distances between doors. The committee is to make recommendations by July 1991. The flight attendants group, in a prepared statement, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s plans would have created a 72-foot distance between some of the plane's exit doors. The association had urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to save 747 exits over the wing, saying `` passengers in many crashes have been unable to reach exits in post-crash fires.'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had planned to remove two of the 10 exit doors on new 747s but abandoned the plan prior to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order. He said the new order would not affect any <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> model. Previous <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules have required require at least one exit door for every 55 seats. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said all narrow-body airplanes and most wide-body planes already conform to the new distance limit.

<TEXT>
 A ball bearing manufacturer has agreed to pay the government $ 14.3 million to settle claims the company overcharged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> man who initiated the charges will get a more than $ 1 million slice of the settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butenkoff </PERSON>, a former regional salesman for <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tectonics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dexter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, will receive $ 1,427,952.40. Under a provision of the False Claims Act, individuals can bring fraud suits on behalf of themselves and the government and are entitled to a percentage of any money the government receives. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Butenkoff </PERSON>'s settlement award is the largest of its type since the law was revamped in 1986 Butenkoff, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, did not return repeated telephone messages Friday. Butenkoff filed suit in November 1985 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, accusing Industrial Tectonics of overcharging <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> for ball bearings delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and overcharged <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> for bearings used in nuclear reactors by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The military received the hardware between 1979 and 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The government joined the suit in January 1986, and investigations by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> supported the claims, the department said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Axel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company that purchased Industrial Tectonics in December 1982, said most of the alleged overcharges occurred before the company was sold and all came before <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> changed management at the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> plant. Way said <PERSON> Butenkoff </PERSON> filed the suit after he was fired, but he declined to discuss the circumstances around the dismissal. Way also said the settlement `` in large part'' comes from the former owner, whom he declined to identify. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said other claims against <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tectonics </ORGANIZATION> remain and will be resolved in administrative proceedings. The department said those claims are expected to bring the government more than $ 6 million. Way said the company denies the remaining claims.

<HEAD>US Concerned, Cautious On Iran-Moscow Moves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will continue with its cautious approach towards <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> despite concern about the improvement in relations between the Moslem fundamentalist nation and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We and others will find it difficult to understand efforts to move close to a regime that continues to support international terrorism and hostage-taking,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We are watching closely the evolution of the Soviet relationship -LRB- with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' she said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended almost a decade of chilly relations by signing a long-term cooperation pact Friday, with the possibility that an arms deal may follow. The pact was signed at the end of a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by the speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. A communique issued by both sides said the two nations agreed `` to build and develop good neighborly relations on the principles of equality.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the acting commander of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces, is the highest ranking Iranian official to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the 1979 revolution that crushed the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and sent mobs into the streets shouting `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Death to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>!'' A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told journalists Friday he thought the Soviets were `` reverting to type'' in their dealings with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The official, who refused to allow his name or title to be used, explained he believes the Soviet moves harkened back to a tendency `` to try to take advantage of Western governments.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980, five months after militants seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must renounce terrorism and help free Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before relations can be resumed. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` concerned about the possibility of weapons transfers.'' `` We indicated our concern across the whole spectrum of questions involving proliferation of missiles and chemical technology,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said about his meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be guided by developments in that nation, not by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Unisys Suspension Lifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will have to enforce ethical standards for employees and improve contracting procedures under terms of a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that caused the service to lift its suspensions of three units of the defense contractor. The lifting of the suspension was announced Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and involves the bidding rights of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' Shipboard and <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> and the Communications Systems Division. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement which said, `` at the time of the suspension, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> had initiated vigorous actions to ensure that known individuals responsible for the misconduct were removed from the company and that a disciplined program of self-governance was put into place to guard against such abuses in the future.'' `` The company had conducted an internal investigation; had disciplined a number of individuals; and had adopted new procedures and controls,'' the service said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was created three years ago by the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, a pair of firms whose chief products were computers. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the company is pleased with the decision while discussions relating to its involvement in the `` Operation Ill Wind'' defense procurement investigation `` are in progress with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and the company remains committed to reaching speedy resolution of all issues relating to that investigation.'' The `` Ill Wind'' probe includes allegations that private consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 15th largest defense contractor, received $ 1.4 billion worth of contracts last year from the Pentagon. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, former general manager for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' surveillance and fire control division on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is awaiting sentencing next month on his guilty plea to bribery <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> has been cooperating with the investigation. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a Washington-based representative, also pleaded guilty to concealing illegal political donations to former Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, who died earlier this year, was never charged.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Aimed At Circumventing Flag Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, angered over this week's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is constitutionally protected free speech, passed legislation aimed at making desecration of the flag unlawful. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., had the measure tacked onto an unrelated child care bill late Friday `` I'm confident it's constitutional,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a leading congressional liberal, told his colleagues. The move in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> came as several lawmakers introduced constitutional amendments in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> following the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said such attempts should be taken cautiously and that it would `` be extraordinarily slow to amend the First Amendment to the Constitution,'' which is `` at the heart of our constitutional liberties and freedom. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said his simple legislation could accomplish the same aim as a constitutional amendment. The bill reads: `` Whoever knowingly and publicly mutilates, defaces, burns, displays on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shall be fined not more than $ 1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s bill is identical to the federal statute on flag desecration except it removes the words `` cast contempt.'' The majority <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinion reasoned that a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute on flag desecration violated the First Amendment because it was aimed at protecting against acts toward the flag which would be offensive to others. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s measure would treat desecration as an act of vandalism without considering whether anyone was offended by the act, presumably answering the court's First Amendment concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> may consider next week a resolution similar to the one passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week expressing opposition to the view of the court. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was also exploring ways of getting around the decision without a constitutional amendment, possibly by taking away from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction over lawsuits on flag desecration. `` I think the mood of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is to do something effective and not just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag,'' he said. A new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment, he said.

<HEAD>Propaganda Specialist Takes Over China's Leading Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army propaganda specialist has taken over as editor in chief at the official daily of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a reshuffling of the newspaper's management, authorities announced today. The replacements at The People's Daily came as the party stepped up its propaganda campaign to defend the harsh suppression of pro-democracy activists during a June 3-4 military operation in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died. The People's Daily is distributed to all offices and work units throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Its editorials, generally carried in other major dailies, are regarded as party gospel in this, the world's most populous country. During the past two days, the official press has also announced arrests of 13 people the government describes as agents of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with a mission to stir up anti-Communist sentiments. The foreign affairs office of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaze </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, had replaced <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenrui </PERSON> as chief editor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading paper. The office also said <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Liren </PERSON>, director at the daily, had left his post. He was replaced by <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON>, a senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Bot Qian and <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> resigned because of health reasons, the office said without elaborating. The party has been increasing efforts to brand the activists as `` counterrevolutionaries'' and defend the recent arrests and executions. More than 1,700 people have been arrested and 27 executed since the nationwide crackdown began almost three weeks ago. Hundreds of journalists from all the major national dailies and broadcasting stations participated in the pro-democracy rallies that led to the crackdown. For a brief time in late May, the official press was more independent than it had ever been in history. The press quickly reverted to acting as an unquestioning organ for government and party propaganda after the military drive in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to quash the democracy movement. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured in that violence, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. In other arrests, evening radio and television broadcasts said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaobo </PERSON>, an instructor at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who recently returned from six months in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, published anti-Communist essays overseas and advocated abolition of the Communists' one-party rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for cutting off military aid in protest of the crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has pressured President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take stronger action, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s limited sanctions won praise from former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` If in our anger we drive <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> back into the shadows of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the oppressive economic system -LRB- senior leader -RRB- <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has tried to reform, those who have died for freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will truly have died in vain,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said in an article written for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>. As president, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> reopened the door to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a visit in 1972. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the arrests of three more student and worker leaders were also reported today. Authorities in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> also arrested 40 people for joining in protests that rocked the city after the military assault in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the People's Daily said. A Chinese source in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said night-shift workers were ordered to carry their identification papers in anticipation of more police searches for activists. The report suggested police were preparing another major sweep of arrests. There were reports, meanwhile, that the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was in session to formally oust party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, another member of the powerful five-man Politburo Standing Committee. However, they were impossible to confirm. One European diplomat said the meeting had taken place or was about to convene, and results would be announced on Sunday. Other sources said senior officials from the provinces were being flown into a military airport in southern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen in public since May 19. It is believed he opposed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decision to impose martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and use military force to crush the student demonstrations. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who had directed party propaganda, is also believed to have been pushed out because of his moderate stand.

<HEAD>GAO Says Navy Improperly Restricted Competition on Computer Contract</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> improperly restricted competition on a $ 30 million computer contract by setting specifications that only allowed <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to bid, says a congressional watchdog agency.

 As Chinese students mounted pro-democracy protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this spring, a government spokesman called a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group an instigator of the movement. `` The student demonstrations have two backstage directors: <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. Both `` directors'' are doing little directing now, though. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, has taken refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring, the U.S.-based exile group at the forefront of the Chinese democracy movement the last six years, has been racked by internal strife. The turmoil, in fact, climaxed this spring, blunting its impact during the crucial moment in Chinese history. Since January, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring has taken its founder, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingzhang </PERSON>, to court over bank transactions. The rift has kept <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring on the sidelines during the student protests that culminated June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square. Founded by <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in 1983, the group has been dogged by controversy throughout its existence. Members of the Standing Committee often change, and critics frequently accuse it of accepting funds from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s ruling party, the Kuomintang. Yet, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring used an underground network of supporters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to smuggle out manuscripts by <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading political prisoners, giving the group stature. At its zenith, <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> claimed 50 branches on five continents. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring favors non-violent means to `` promote democracy and improve human rights conditions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the ultimate goal of transforming the totalitarian system into a <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> one,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> wrote in the group's magazine. Even supporters-turned-opponents credit <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> with having the foresight to envision a grass-roots democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> is history. I give him credit for starting the movement, but I think he finished his mission,'' says <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> <PERSON> Shengping </PERSON>, a new leader of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was expelled from the Standing Committee last January. In a statement, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring said he `` seriously mixed up his public and private financial affairs.'' In February, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> struck back, taking out a full-page ad in World Journal, the New York-based, Chinese-language newspaper. He denied financial wrongdoing, and labeled two <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring leaders as `` secret <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> agents.'' Both men denied the accusation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring won a temporary restraining order in March barring <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> from withdrawing $ 73,000 he had moved from the group's savings account to a separate account. In April, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s supporters broke away, forming a new faction called the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> hopes relations can be improved among members. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring is holding a convention in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and more than a hundred people are expected to attend. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Friday to attend the convention and said he hopes the convention will lead toward reconciliation.

<HEAD>Cardinal Manning Dead at 79 of Spinal Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a champion of the poor and oppressed during his 15 years as <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has died of spinal cancer at 79. He died Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said A.J. <PERSON> Antczak </PERSON>, managing editor of The Tidings, the diocesan newspaper. Manning's successor, Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, was at <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s side when he died `` We were praying the litany of saints when he peacefully slipped away,'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, who compared <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s life to that of Father <PERSON> Junipero </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, the 18th century priest who founded the missions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said it was as if `` we were just adding his name to that long list of heroic and saintly men and women to whom we commended his spirit.'' A native of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1928. Although he retired as archbishop in 1985, he observed the 55th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on Friday, <PERSON> Antczak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> was `` a man of great strength, courage and compassion,'' former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` He enriched the life of thousands who are better because of his good work.'' Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> ordered flags at city buildings flown at half-staff in Manning's honor. Manning, after serving two years as a bishop in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, became archbishop in 1970, taking over from Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, whose final years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> were filled with discord. In 1970, minority <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> complained of alienation weekly during protests in front of St. Basil's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Young priests and nuns often found themselves at odds with the hierarchy and quietly referred to the chancery as `` the fortress.'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> moved his residence to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vibiana </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the skid row section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He established ministries for blacks and Hispanics and began a Priests' Senate to give the clergy greater say. An <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Parochial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> extended the participation to the parish level. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> also visited with local Protestant and Jewish congregations. He assured <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war protesters they could declare themselves conscientious objectors and often spoke against the nuclear arms race, saying in 1981: `` The cry of the poor for bread has been answered by warheads.'' In 1983, he petitioned then Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to halt the deportation of Salvadoran refugees. His social liberalism was matched by a theological conservatism. He denounced abortion as murder and announced that any Catholic who cooperated in an abortion would be excommunicated from the church. Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s auxiliary bishop, said of Manning: `` He was an outstanding, princely gentleman, the perfect priest who was devoted to his work with priests and people alike.'' After ordination in 1934, he went to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for postgraduate studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Gregorian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He received a doctor of canon law degree in 1938. He was named an auxiliary bishop in 1946 and consecrated a full bishop the same year. Two years later he was made chancellor in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and in 1955 he was made vicar general. In 1967 he was appointed bishop of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>. In 1973, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> elevated Manning to the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>. A Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated Wednesday morning and throughout the day his remains will lie in state. More than 100 bishops from around the globe were expected to gather Thursday morning for another Mass of Christian burial and burial will follow.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant has suspended low-power testing indefinitely after federal regulators shut down the reactor because of a malfunctioning valve. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., a leading <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponent, said Friday that top <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regional officials told him an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official had to grab a control room operator to get him to shut down the reactor Thursday `` What we have here is a situation where the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> reactor operators were not able to follow their own procedures, and an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official in the control room, first having given a verbal instruction, had to physically grab one of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> operators to ensure that procedures would be followed to shut the plant down immediately,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` That did n't happen,'' <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said operators already were aware of the problem when the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official spoke up, and three minutes later decided to shut down the reactor. No one was grabbed, he said. The commission believes operators waited `` several minutes'' too long before shutting down the reactor at 12:36 p.m. Thursday, plant executive <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We did not strictly adhere to our test procedures'' in response to temperature and pressure changes in various systems, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` At no time was there a risk to plant systems or the general public,'' <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s low-level testing license is not affected by the incident, and the commission `` wo n't say -LRB- operators -RRB- made a mistake. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed that the plant will delay resumption of low-power tests until operators pinpoint why the valve malfunctioned in the non-nuclear area, make any necessary repairs, and review the actions with <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said he had no idea how long the process would take. A decade behind schedule, the bitterly contested plant won permission to conduct low-power tests earlier this month. The tests began June 13 and had been running smoothly. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunfey </PERSON>, a member of the anti-Seabrook <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said her group thinks the situation is more serious than <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> or federal officials have said. `` Our feeling is that for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, characteristically irresponsible in their handling of problems of this nature, to take this step ... indicates a very serious breach by operators,'' <PERSON> Dunfey </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he was undisturbed by the situation. `` It is also reassuring to know that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is taking the necessary steps to ensure safe operations if appropriate procedures at the plant were not followed,'' he said.

 A jury has sentenced a woman convicted of killing a couple to steal their 9-day-old son to life in prison without probation or parole. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> dropped her head and cried Friday when the verdict was read.

 A former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> has been sentenced to life in prison for the slaying of a black teen-ager who was abducted at random and tortured. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoghby </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> the maximum prison sentence Friday, calling the 1981 beating and hanging death of a 19-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, `` a heinous, senseless killing.'' `` The punishment should fit the crime,'' he said. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a 28-year-old truck driver, was convicted of murder May 18 as an accomplice in the <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> killing. Another Klansman was convicted of murder earlier and sentenced to death; a third pleaded guilty to federal civil rights charges and became a prosecution witness. A fourth awaits trial. A lawsuit stemming from <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s death resulted in a landmark judgment that bankrupted one Klan organization, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klans </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The $ 7 million judgment was assessed by a federal court jury in a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Beulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. She died last year. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> was chosen at random from a city street and slain in a <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> revenge plot on March 21, 1981, according to testimony. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> was charged with providing the rope, giving permission to another Klansman to provide the .22 - caliber pistol used in <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s abduction and then later viewing the body in a At Friday's hearing, defense attorneys presented 15 character witnesses, including the defendant's parents. `` I'll never believe he was involved in the death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>'s mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, said in an appeal for mercy. The defendant buried his face in a handkerchief and wept during much of the testimony from friends, family and his neighbors in <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON>, a small community outside Mobile. Defense attorney <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> said he would appeal the conviction and sentence. He told the judge <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> was a `` model father, a model citizen, who has led an exemplary life.'' Although <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> did not participate in the killing and had no prior criminal convictions, District Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> said to place him on probation `` would be a sham, and a slap in the face of every black human being in this country.'' <PERSON> Zoghby </PERSON> said he understood that <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s role was `` limited,'' but, he said: `` The whole incident itself was a heinous, senseless crime that bespeaks of a page in history best to be put behind us, never to be repeated again.'' In a final bid for mercy, <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> told the judge, `` Sir, I'd just like to say I'm not guilty of murder.'' Handcuffed and led away by deputies, <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> kissed his wife, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON>. His mother collapsed in her husband's arms, crying, `` Oh, God.'' According to testimony, the killing was the result of a <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> meeting on March 18, 1981, where killing a black was suggested. Local Klansmen were angered over a mistrial in the case of a black man charged in the slaying of a white <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> police sergeant.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gun shop operators are having trouble keeping gun locks and safety boxes in stock following passage of a bill that could send adults to jail for leaving guns within children's reach. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> was called into special session this week after a string of accidental shootings left three children dead. The shootings reversed long-standing opposition to toughening the state's liberal gun laws. `` We used to sell maybe four or five trigger locks for every 100 guns,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON>, assistant manager at Tamiami Gun and Range Shops in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Now it seems everyone wants one.'' Gun locks work by immobilizing the trigger. Some consist only of plastic straps, while lock-and-key units sell for $ 8 to $ 12. Some gun owners are opting for more costly vaults with a key or combination lock. `` There's a whole new awareness about guns, and that can only lead to less accidents,'' said <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON>. WJNO-AM in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> distributed more than 500 gun locks free last week at two shopping malls. `` People have been calling the station asking where they can get more,'' said <ORGANIZATION> WJNO </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>. `` People are very aware of the new law.'' Southern Gun and Tackle, a Florida-based nationwide gun distributor, said gun lock orders have more than doubled in the past month. `` We've proposed to the dealers that they offer the lock with every gun they sell,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, manager of the company's purchasing department Under the statute, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in homes or businesses could face a third-degree felony charge if a child 15 years old or younger shoots someone. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a $ 5,000 fine. Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in public or threatens others with the weapon. The bill was drafted with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and would take effect Oct. 1 once signed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Police officers and military personnel are exempted as are cases in which the guns were obtained illegally, such as a burglary. A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday by <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> following shootings involving children in that state. <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest gun lock makers, distributes 220,000 to 250,000 locks each year, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He said sales were increasing. `` Unfortunately, sales increases often follow catastrophes such as accidental shootings,'' he said. `` I've always encouraged my customers to buy trigger locks. It took killings to convince some people they are really needed,'' said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Gunrunner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Wain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, clerk <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulton </PERSON> said a case of 24 trigger locks used to last about six months. `` We've sold four cases since word of the law first came out,'' he said. `` These things sold very sparingly before. Now, they are really moving.''

 Singer <PERSON> Hibari </PERSON> <PERSON> Misora </PERSON>, who symbolized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar recovery to millions of Japanese, died of heart failure this morning after a lengthy illness. She was 52. The death of the woman some compared to the famed French singer <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Piaf </PERSON> topped the morning news, and television broadcasts were filled with pictures of weeping fans and hundreds of reporters crowding around her house. National television networks made plans to interrupt normal programming this evening to broadcast special retrospective shows. Within hours of her death, producers and critics dressed in black funeral wear solemnly discussed her career on talk shows. `` It's a party's over kind of feeling,'' said music critic <PERSON> Toyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> in a four-page special on Ms. <PERSON> Misora </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected an offer by the governor to mediate negotiations in an attempt to end the 2 -LCB- - month-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> issued the invitation Friday to <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, to mediate the strike talks. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> accepted the offer within hours of <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s speech at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting, but <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> declined the invitation Friday night, asking the governor instead to urge <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders to halt the strike. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> could not accept a condition <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> had set for the talks at his mansion. The governor had asked coal companies to promise not to ship coal for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> while it is engaged in the negotiations. `` Such interference with business relationships can play no constructive role in any attempt to resolve the dispute, and is, in fact, counterproductive,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> also said collective bargaining mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, from which the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> withdrew June 7, was the proper forum for resolving the strike. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> set three other conditions for the talks _ that both sides negotiate in good faith, that more than 44,000 miners in 10 states end wildcat strikes and that legal action against the union be dropped. `` The <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> welcomes Gov. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s offer to play a positive role in ending this dispute,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. `` As I have repeatedly said, I am ready to go anywhere at any time to meet with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and his management team to negotiate a mutually beneficial end to the union's dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>.'' About 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> on April 5 when the company imposed a contract after 14 months of fruitless negotiations. It requires overtime and Sunday work and cuts medical benefits to retirees. After a June 11 rally at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> attended, wildcat strikes began spreading through coal country, idling 44,000 workers in 10 states. The walkout continued mostly unabated Friday, despite several companies winning back-to-work court orders against <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members whose contracts forbid sympathy strikes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> postponed separate hearings for five companies who asked that the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and its members be held in contempt for ignoring back-to-work orders. Union lawyer <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said the judge suggested the postponement because of the logistical problems of 18 separate hearings in one day and indicated he wanted to give the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> time to consider <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s proposal. A federal court in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Western District issued an order Friday finding <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members at <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> operations there in contempt for defying a back-to-work order. Any union member who ignores the court's order and fails to report to work beginning Monday will be fined $ 100 a day. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> signed an order Friday directing <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders to appear at a hearing next week to answer contempt charges for refusing an order to return to work. Back-to-work orders also are being sought by companies in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to seek similar legal action in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. About 100 miners returned to work in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clairsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and no new walkouts were reported Friday. In <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, roving pickets turned away about 600 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> members at a <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant that makes railroad coal cars, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> owns BethEnergy Mines. The estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts, according to union and industry officials, are: <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> 16,000; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 8,500; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 6,900; <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, 5,000; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 2,560; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 2,325; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 1,750; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 755; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 350; and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, 200.

 Immigration officials will let 78 Vietnamese refugees stay temporarily in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after they burned their vessel at sea to force authorities to take them ashore, news reports said. The officials initially said the Vietnamese would be given a new boat and towed back out to sea, the reports said Friday. But they later decided the 45 men and 33 women could stay on <LOCATION> Sangdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off the south coast until their burned boat is repaired, the reports said. The boat people burned their boat at sea on June 17. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says its only refugee camp is already overcrowded and the boat people can not stay. The government said 1,057 Vietnamese boat people have been resettled in third countries since the 1975 communist takeover in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But 219 are awaiting resettlement. Local villagers have also objected to the presence of the newcomers. About 100 villagers in 16 fishing vessels blocked patrol boats carrying the refugees for five hours Thursday in an effort to prevent them from landing, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. It said the villagers called off the protest after immigration officials promised the Vietnamese stay would be limited to 30 days. The refugees were given five tents, 10 boxes of instant noodles, rice, medicine, T-shirts, pants, towels and soap, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Quincy, Mass., Halves Dropout Rate by Tailoring School to Students'
Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

 The dropout rate was halved after this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb's officials lavished attention on potential dropouts, offering day-care centers, vocational training for the disabled and night classes for working teens. `` The secret is, a kid ca n't drop out without going through a long program of help-providers,'' said Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> on Friday. `` It's nothing that has n't been done. But most districts are n't that flexible. There's a blueprint here for urban districts.'' <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> calculated the dropout rate by following a group of students from ninth grade through the day they should graduate. The traditional method is to compare senior classes from year to year. By tracking ninth-graders, the schools can more accurately assess whether programs are working, experts said. In <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, they apparently work. The 1987-88 class graduating lost 19.7 percent of its students. This year's graduating class was down by just 10.9 percent, a loss of 70 students out of 643 potential graduates. The success in retaining students came from a simple formula. Said <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>: `` They get a lot of attention and a lot of alternatives.'' Any eighth-graders thought to be potential dropouts receive special counseling to help them make the transition to high school. This is followed up through their ninth grade school year. Potential dropouts are usually a year or more older than their classmates; behind in basic skill levels; or from families that are poorly educated, school officials said. <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> offers schooling for teen-age mothers by providing day care for their babies, and vocational training for the disabled. The school schedule can be adjusted to the student's needs, including part-time work combined with courses for credit at a junior college or in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> extension program. Students can work during the day and study for a general equivalency diploma, or a GED, at night. If these inducements do n't work, and a student is determined to drop out, he is encouraged to take the GED exam. If he passes, he can receive his diploma on graduation day. If not, he can take courses to help him pass. <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> is a largely blue-collar city of 89,000 people just south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Its public schools serve 8,000 youngsters. The district consists of two high schools and one vocational school. The program was developed through policy changes and some reorginzation, resulting in no significant budget increase. The Quincy results drew applause Friday from others concerned with dropout prevention. <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a labor market specialist concerned with the problems of urban education, praised the Quincy program. `` The dropout problem is something a lot of people are dealing with. When you lose half your ninth-grade class in some of our nation's largest cities, your community is going to suffer,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` The best drop-out prevention program has the top administrators involved. What is so notable -LRB- about <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> -RRB- is that the superintendent is so passionate about it.'' In major cities the attrition rate can be 40 percent to 60 percent, school officials said. Halving a dropout rate is impressive, said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, an international educational consulting firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that works with more than 40 urban school districts on dropout prevention. `` What it seems like they're doing, that they've put in a really good exit intervention,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said. She said researchers are finding that it's the `` comprehensive'' programs that work.

 <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> moved into the political spotlight as a disciple of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, successfully installing economic reforms in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and bringing a progressive style to the Chinese leadership. But with his ouster today as general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> ended up with the same fate as his predecessor _ stripped of power and disgraced for sympathizing with students seeking democratic reforms. In his tailored Western suits, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> once represented the emergence of a new brand of leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a change from the revolutionary heroes who founded the communist state in 1949 to a new generation showing more interest in economic results than Marxist ideology. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 69, took over as acting <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in January 1987 after the ouster of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who also was considered too sympathetic to student protesters calling for political reforms. Nine months later, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> formally was named party chief. Hu's death on April 15 set off the student demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> too has fallen from favor after showing support for some of the demands of students and opposing the decision to declare martial law in the capital. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen in public since May 19, a day before martial law was imposed. While tens of thousands of students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told visiting Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people could enjoy `` genuine democracy'' under the 47 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He also said political and economic reform should proceed at an equal pace. Like <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, accused of being a capitalist sympathizer. In 1967 he was dragged from his home in the southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION> -RRB- and paraded through the streets with a dunce cap on his head. But he came out of the internal exile that followed to energetically carry out <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s market-oriented reforms, measures designed to rebuild and modernize a country that had fallen apart during the extreme leftism and repression of the Cultural Revolution. In 1975, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> became governor of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, the country's most populous province. He dismantled communes and allowed peasants to till private plots. The reforms ended food shortages that had people at the brink of starvation. Under <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, the central province harvested bumper yields. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> brought <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1980 as a member of the party's policy-making Politburo and vice premier Six months later be became premier and served in that post until picked to head the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He traveled widely throughout the world and earned a reputation as an urbane and self-assured <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader who was tough at the negotiating table. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was born in October 1919, the son of a wealthy landowner in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province. As with most Chinese leaders, few details of his family life are known. He has been married twice and has four sons and a daughter, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>, who studied in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1981-83. He told reporters that he worked 10 hours a day, jogged in the morning and argued with his family at the dinner table. He also regularly played golf, a sport once condemned in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a luxury. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1932 and became a full party member in 1936, 13 years before the communists came to power after chasing the Chinese Nationalists from the mainland. He headed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in his native county for most of the 1937-45 war between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While serving as a regional party official in the 1950's, he orchestrated a purge in southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province against cadres accused of corruption, ties to Nationalist <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and opposition to land reform. In 1957, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> oversaw a `` rectification'' campaign in which 80,000 officials were banished to the countryside, where they worked and faced criticism for their past actions. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> disappeared for four years after being purged at the start of the Cultural Revolution, finally re-emerging as party secretary in Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in 1971. Duing those chaotic years, he appeared opportunistic. At one point, he called for exposure of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s alleged crimes in an apparent act of self-preservation not uncommon in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tumultuous politics. By the time <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> reappeared and consolidated power in 1978, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was firmly tied to the reformers. `` We must not bind ourselves as silkworms do within cocoons,'' he said in a 1979 speech. `` All economic patterns and conventions which hold back the development of productive forces should be abolished.''

 Communist officials have turned to a multilingual engineer with a flare for economics to shepherd <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and their 47 million party members out of the political crisis stemming from the pro-democracy movement. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, named today to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> as party general secretary, is a university graduate who speaks English and Russian. More importantly, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 62, is credited by hard-liners for moving swiftly to end large protests that broke out in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> following the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Last week, three men were executed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for participating in riots. They were the first in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to die in protest-related incidents. A total of 27 have been executed since the nationwide crackdown began three weeks ago. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> entered the 17-member ruling Politburo as a collegue of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s in November 1987. Last year, he gave up his post as mayor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city with a population of 12 million, to become party secretary of the city. Like conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> represents the new breed of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader, a technocrat loyal to the party and to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s policies of economic pragmatism. As mayor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, he aggressively promoted the city as a financial center and an attractive location for foreign investment. Also like <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> spent time in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, working as a trainee in a car factory around 1955. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was born July 1926 in <LOCATION> Yangzhou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1946. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jiaotong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in 1947. After returning from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he was a deputy chief engineer at an automobile plant in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, like most bureaucrats of his generation, was apparently purged from office during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. In 1980, he re-emerged as a senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Import and Export Affairs and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Investment. He went on to be named minister of the electronics industry and in 1985 returned to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> as mayor and deputy secretary of the party committee. In 1986, during student demonstrations in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, he went to his alma mater and, seeing a poster with Chinese-language excerpts from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Address </ORGANIZATION>, surprised students by reciting in English from the speech. He told students they knew the words but not the essence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president's speech and later criticized them for `` superficial'' knowledge of the West. According to official profiles, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> also reads Romanian, French and Japanese. He is said to be fond of music and literature. He is reportedly the son-in-law of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s former president. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is one of the old-guard conservatives who supported <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> in the current suppression of dissent.

<TEXT>
 The new owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> football team is n't getting many cheers for a plan to outfit the team's cheerleaders in skimpier uniforms Several of the team's cheerleaders say they had learned they might be required to wear Spandex cycling shorts and halter tops. They said that they also were asked to act as hostesses at parties, fraternize with the team and appear in beer commercials. More than a third have walked off the squad in protest, but <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Friday the furor is a misunderstanding and he has n't changed any rules or policies. He said violations of the cheerleading squad policies that prohibited drinking in uniform and fraternizing with players would no longer result in automatic expulsion. `` Let's count on the judgment of these wonderful people,'' said the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> oilman, who bought the team earlier this year. `` Let's not depend on rules. But he did concede that a change was being considered in the cheerleaders' familiar uniforms of white hot pants, go-go boots, blue shirts tied at the midriff and fringed vests. The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> asked its readers to call in their opinion of new outfits for the cheerleaders. The question was: `` Should <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> change the cheerleaders' uniforms and make them fraternize with the team?'' More than 93 percent said no. Only 208 callers sided with the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> owner, while 2,808 called in to say he should leave the uniforms alone. `` As far as the Cowboys Cheerleaders are concerned, they are the best in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rest are some of the cheapest,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I hope they keep the uniforms and morals up, and keep it just like it's been for years.'' <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 37 of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, took exception to the cheerleaders' current look `` The uniforms look like a private school, or something,'' he said. Cheerleader director <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> has resigned and 14 veterans said they would leave with her. The 23 new members have until Monday to decide whether to stay. Several Cowboys Cheerleaders said conditions had become too lax since <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> bought the team in February, firing longtime coach <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> the same day. Under former owner H.R. `` Bum'' Bright, squad members were not allowed to drink or even be photographed with someone holding a drink while in uniform.

 <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says women who are used to wearing swimsuits without high heels should have a foot up on their competition in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> beauty pageant.

 Hundreds of supporters of opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> violated martial law by taking to the streets of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital a day after she was criticized by the government, sources said today. Friday's gathering was one of the largest assemblies by opposition supporters since military commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power last September and his troops crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people. Hundreds of thousands of people protested nationwide last year to demand an end to a quarter century of military control of the government. One Burmese witness reached in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said hundreds of supporters of <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> clogged an entire street block near the central market Friday after hearing rumors she would make a speech there. She was instead campaigning outside the capital, and the people dispersed after security personnel arrived, the witness said on condition of anonymity. A Western diplomat, giving a slightly different account, said thousands of people waited for the opposition leader near the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and some chanted slogans. He said the crowd dispersed after the arrival of security personnel and a monsoon downpour. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has allowed the formation of opposition parties and pledged a general election next year. But he is apparently worried about the popular following of <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and her National League for Democracy, the diplomat said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. On Thursday, government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> accused her and her party of defying martial law and organizing anti-government demonstrations. He said the party `` must bear the consequences of irresponsible and illegal acts.'' A day earlier, a man was killed when hundreds of people gathered in northern <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in a memorial to those who died at the hands of government forces last year. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said a member of the security forces opened fire when the crowd charged. Western witnesses said today that government security personnel kicked women at the gathering and hit other people with rifle butts.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today ousted party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, blaming him for the turmoil caused by the pro-democracy movement and for dividing the party. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 69, an architect of a decade of economic reform, was replaced by <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party leader who cracked down on demonstrations in his city. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> is also considered an advocate of economic modernization. The replacement of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as general secretary of the 47-million member party was announced in a communique by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. A change in party leadership had been rumored since the military assault in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 left hundreds and perhaps thousands of pro-democracy supporters dead. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has taken a hard line in dealing with the protests since then. He moved swiftly to end large protests that broke out in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and three men were executed last week in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for participating in riots. A total of 27 people have been executed nationwide. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is believed to have been purged for opposing senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s use of troops to quell student protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen in public since May 19, and his whereabouts were unknown today. The communique, issued after a plenary session of 276 regular and alternate members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had `` unshirkable responsibilities'' for the recent political turmoil stemming from huge pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital and many other Chinese cities. It accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of supporting the turmoil and `` splitting the party.'' It said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> caused `` serious losses to the cause of the party.'' The report on <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was read by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, the conservative who triumphed over <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> in a party power struggle stemming from the protests. The communique said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was dismissed as general secretary, from his post in the 17-member ruling Politburo and its <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, from membership in the 175-member policymaking <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He had served as premier before he was named party chief in January 1987. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 62, served as mayor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, from 1985 to 1988, when he moved over to head the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the city. He entered the Politburo, where he was a collegue of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s, in November 1987. The communique said nothing about filing criminal charges against <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who has been accused of supporting a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' The communique acknowledged that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> `` did something beneficial to the reform, the opening of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the outside world and economic work.'' It said the party will `` look further into his case.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also decided to remove <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, 60, from the Politburo Standing Committee. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> is considered a moderate who also opposed the introduction of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> is a technocrat who speaks Russian and English. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, he has actively worked to restore the city's reputation as a financial center and to attract foreign investment to revive its industrial base. Some earlier reports had suggested that <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, a Politburo member in change of internal security, would be named to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. The party also expanded the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from five to six members, replacing <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON> and economist <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON>, head of the party <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It also announced a reshuffling in the party's four-member Secretariat, removing <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> allies <PERSON> Rui </PERSON> <PERSON> Xingwen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingfu </PERSON> and replacing them with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON> and Politburo alternate <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangen </PERSON>. The Secretariat is responsible for day-to-day operations. The new Standing Committee members are all regarded as strong advocates of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s open-door economic policies with the outside world. They are also likely to back <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s attempt to unify the party behind his hard-line stance toward activists and other critics. The communique said the Politburo met from Monday through Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which must make all formal decisions on leadership positions, held its session on Friday and today. The leadership changes have been expected since May, when the pro-democracy student demonstrations split the party leadership and triggered a power struggle between moderates and hard-liners. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, came down on the side of the hard-liners, deciding to declare martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20 and ordering the military attack on the city. Earlier today, authorities announced an army propaganda specialist has taken over as editor in chief at the official daily of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a reshuffling of the newspaper's management The foreign affairs office of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaze </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, had replaced <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenrui </PERSON> as chief editor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading paper. The office also said <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Liren </PERSON>, director at the daily, had left his post. He was replaced by <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON>, a senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Both Qian and <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> resigned because of health reasons, the office said without elaborating. The replacements at The People's Daily came as the party stepped up its propaganda campaign to defend the suppression of pro-democracy activists.

However, the Marxist government and the U.S-backed rebels must still carry out difficult talks to make the pact a permanent peace. Rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Moscow-trained President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed the truce and sealed it with a handshake late Thursday at an African summit in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who left for home Friday to tell his forces to prepare for peace, said before departing, `` I was not born to make war at all cost.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s army has controlled most of southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for years, administering schools and hospitals in rural areas occupied by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, son of a part-time Protestant preacher, told the Zairian news agency he was prepared to work `` without preconditions'' with <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' government. President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> ally credited with a prominent role in the reconciliation, will mediate future negotiations. The conservative <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> is to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday to discuss peace in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The summit of 20 African leaders in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> was the first meeting between <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> since the former allies in a struggle for black rule went to war in 1975 as <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonizers left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Their agreement took many people by surprise. As recently as Monday, Angolan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> said his government would not negotiate with the rebels. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, born in 1934, leads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a socialist group backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It has fought to share power with <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' Marxist Popular Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces and receives arms mainly from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Despite thousands of foreign troops having supported both sides, neither the government nor the rebels came close to delivering a knockout blow in the war. The cease-fire follows a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December. Under that earlier pact, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, and halt aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas in exchange for withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops backing <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' government However, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was not party to that agreement. His future role in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was not clear. The Portugese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> said today that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> could become <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s representative to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a period of two years. The agency quoted unidentified Angolan officials as saying <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> could be named `` special counselor'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been pushing for diplomatic recoginition by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There was no indication <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s possible appointment would lead to recognition, and there was no independent confirmation of the <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> report. Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> will go into exile under terms of the new pact but did not provide details. Reports in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s exile would be temporary. Rebel sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, however, said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would stay in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> `` reaffirmed that he had no intention of participating in the next government.'' The accord calls for reintegration of rebel forces into Angolan society and the creation of a national reconciliation commission under <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s chairmanship. However, it set no time or place for the commission to begin its work and did not specify who would represent the rival Angolan parties. The <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the two sides would meet in the next few days in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. It gave no details.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON> rose quickly to the pinnacle of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership under the wings of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a man he once was expected to succeed But <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was purged from the party today in disgrace along with party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, both branded as too lenient on the student-led democracy movement the government crushed earlier this month. Two years ago, at the relatively young age of 58, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was promoted to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an elite group of five to six people who make up the most powerful decision-making body in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hu gained prominence in the mid-1980s for championing the economic reforms initiated by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and traveling throughout the country urging people to help change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We should be bold enough to break with some specific conclusions already proved through practice to be outdated or partly incorrect,'' he said in a speech in April 1986. `` Only by doing so can we uphold and develop Marxism, and push forward the Socialist cause.'' Starting in 1985, as he worked his way up from the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to the Politburo, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> began making public appearances and joined some important missions abroad He also began standing in for senior leaders in dealings with visiting foreign dignitaries. Hu visited <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and he joined <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief at the time, on a tour of five South Pacific nations. The two men are not related. As the reform movement gained momentum, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> solidified his standing under the tutelage of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, prompting speculation that he might succeed his mentor as party general secretary. Then came the student unrest that led to <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>'s ouster in 1987 and criticism that he appeared too sympathetic to protesters demanding political reforms. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON> distanced himself from <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> and later in the year became a member of the Politburo's Standing Committee But he had lost the prominence he gained as a champion of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s fast-paced reforms. Branded a capitalist follower during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was exiled to the countryside. His political comeback began in 1972 when he reappeared as a party functionary in <LOCATION> Ningxia </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> came to power in 1978, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was summoned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> secretary and vice president of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980 Hu was elected mayor of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s third-largest city, and served as director of the party's general office in 1982-84. He joined the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Secretariat in 1982. An engineer and graduate of <LOCATION> Qinghua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> is married with two children. He was born in 1929 in the central province of <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION>. In addition to pushing for reforms, Hu supported <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to open itself to the outside world. Referring to party debate over the open-door policy, he said in a 1985 interview: `` I think it is very necessary for us to try to identify problems and overcome them in a timely fashion. We need fine-tuning from time to time.''

<HEAD>Revenge of the Lawn: Neighbors in Court Over Heels in Sod</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOLIHULL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman accused of walking her dog in a sly and vindictive manner across her neighbors' lawn has agreed to pay compensation. `` This is what could be described as a neighbors' dispute that had got out of hand,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, the prosecuting counsel, told magistrates on Friday. The court in <LOCATION> Solihull </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, heard that <PERSON> Winifred </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, 71, and <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, 74, had discovered holes in the lawn bordering their prize-winning garden. Seeking confirmation of their suspicions, they staked out the yard one February night and said they saw <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, 48, strutting across their grass in high-heeled shoes. When confronted, <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> said to her dog: ` Come on, let's go back and do it again.''' Mrs. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> called the police, who came to Mrs. <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>'s home and asked her to come to the station. `` No chance,'' she allegedly responded and was arrested. `` The prosecution case is that it was an act of intent, it was not an accident or recklessness, and there have been ongoing problems between the two parties,'' <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. A charge of causing damage was dismissed when Mrs. <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> agreed to pay 50 pounds -LRB- $ 78 -RRB- compensation to the sisters and to post a bond of 200 pounds -LRB- $ 310 -RRB- to keep the peace for two years. `` I accept there was a confrontation on the night of Feb. 8, but I have always denied, and maintain my denial, that I committed any criminal offense,'' she said afterward. Mrs. <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> donated the damages to the Police Benevolent Fund in gratitude for the support of the police. `` We hope this will be the end of the matter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said. `` Quite frankly, we feel sorry for her.''

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Says Khomeini's Son Should Lead Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should be governed by a three-member advisory board chaired by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, an editorial in a government-run newspaper said today. The governing board also should include President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Times editorial, which was carried by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The editorial said <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> should be chairman of the board because he was close to his father, the architect of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 1979 Islamic revolution, and familiar with his thinking. `` This will surely enable the leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who himself has been a very close aide and disciple of the imam, not to lose sight ever of the late imam's trend of thought and action,'' the English-language editorial said. Iranians referred to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as the imam, or supreme spiritual leader. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, 49, was chosen to succeed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as the country's supreme leader a day after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 86, died of a heart attack June 3 <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s second term as president expires in October and the constitution bars him from running again. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the 55-year-old parliament speaker and commander of the armed forces, is the only announced candidate in the July 28 presidential elections. The younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 43, had no formal political role but served as his father's chief assistant. The Iranian news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the editorial referred to economic and other unspecified problems the country faces. `` With the experienced aides in different areas, the leadership can most definitely speed up the realization of the divine goals of the Islamic revolution,'' the paper said. There was speculation before <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died that the council he set up to choose his successor would appoint a committee in his place, but the majority selected <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Here is an excerpt from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> statement issued Saturday about the ouster of General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>: The session held that at the critical juncture involving the destiny of the party and the state, <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> made the mistake of supporting the turmoils and splitting the party and he had unshirkable responsibilities for the shaping-up of the turmoils. The nature and consequences of his mistake are very serious. Although he did something beneficial to the reform, the opening of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the outside world and the economic work when he held principal leading posts in the party and government, he obviously erred in guidelines in the party and practical work. Especially after taking charge of the work of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he took a passive approach to the adherence to the four cardinal principles and opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and gravely neglected party building, cultural and ethical development and ideological and political work, causing serious losses to the cause of the party. In view of Comrade <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>'s serious mistakes listed above, the session decided to dismiss him as general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, member of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, member of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and decided to look further into his case.

<HEAD>22 Convicted of Trying to Overthrow Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s state security court today convicted 22 people of trying to overthrow the government and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five to 15 years. Another 11 defendants, including a British national of <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> descent, were acquitted. Most of the defendants belong to the minority Shiite Moslem sect in predominantly Sunni Moslem <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The case was first reported when the indictment was released in March, but authorities never said when the defendants tried to overthrow the government. They include 18 Kuwaitis believed to be of Iranian descent, two Iranians, nine Iraqis, two Lebanese, the Briton and one person whose country of origin was unknown. The defendants included engineers, teachers, computer specialists, electricians, laborers and a former police officer. They were charged with belonging to illegal groups that sought `` to demolish the social and economic fabric of the country,'' spread `` destructive ideologies'' and defame the emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>. The indictment said they used public statements and `` writings, sketches and pictures'' in their activities. Only 20 of the defendants appeared before the court during the trial, which began on May 13. Court Chairman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bannai </PERSON> sentenced them during a public session attended by relatives of the defendants. The defendants present smiled broadly but made no comment. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was a repeated target of terrorist attacks during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war. The attacks were blamed on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, predominately <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> and opposed to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for backing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. One case involved an attempt on the life of the emir in May 1985 when a booby-trapped car rammed into his motorcade and exploded. He escaped with minor injuries, but five people were killed. Relations between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have improved since a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war went into effect in August. But the latest case underscored <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s determination to keep monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> minority.

 Crews worked today to contain 1 million gallons of heating oil that spilled from a tanker and created a five-mile slick that began washing up on the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> coast. White House officials arrived just hours after the Providence-bound tanker World Prodigy, carrying 7.6 million gallons of heating oil, struck a rock at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> about 4:30 p.m. Friday. Just a few hours later, oil spilled in a collision of an oil tanker and a tugboat at the mouth of the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The accidents came three months after nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil gushed into Alaskan waters from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, causing the nation's worst oil spill. Army helicopters surveying the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shore this morning confirmed that oil was washing ashore near <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bendick </PERSON> said curiosity seekers in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> who were hampering cleanup efforts were removed from the town's picturesque beach, across the harbor from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. The spill occurred one mile south of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and by today it was five miles long. No harm to wildlife was immediately reported, but all of the state's beaches were closed today. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said they would remain off-limits until the oil had been cleaned up. Boaters also were asked to stay in port. `` We do n't want boats churning up the oil slick,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, chief of the department's emergency response team. But the organizers said the Salem Pro Sail Series will continue as scheduled today at the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yachting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The competition began June 21 and is set to continue until Sunday. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said a team from Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and special skimmer ships were brought in to combat the spill. Nine of the ship's 27 tanks were damaged, said Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the Marine Safety office in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a diver who surveyed the hull of the 530-foot tanker, said there is a 200-foot-long gash, as wide as five feet, along one side. There are about 150 feet of dents and smaller holes on the other side, he said. `` The damage is so extreme it's impossible to seal the vessel off with any kind of soft patches,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. The Coast Guard began unloading the World Prodigy about 2:20 a.m., and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the work could take up to a week. Cleanup crews initially strung booms around the slick and later replaced them with booms with deeper skirts to pool the oil, said <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON>. The White House, criticized for its response to the Alaskan spill, reacted swiftly to the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> accident. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dispatched <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, to the scene. `` It's a big spill and in a very important place,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said at a news conference about 2 a.m. after federal officials met with Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is one of the crown jewels of the country's ocean resources.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreedan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assistant at the scene, said the president has determined to `` do everything possible to respond to this situation,'' adding, `` We've obviously learned something from that situation'' in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> port, where the ship sailing under a Greek flag was heading, is about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, which feeds into the <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Civic </PERSON>, who lives near <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, witnessed the accident. `` I'm looking and this guy was barrelling along and boom; he just stopped dead in the water. He was moving pretty good, faster than most,'' he said. Officials said the magnitude was far less than the Valdez disaster in March. The amount was less, and No. 2 heating oil is lighter and easier to recover than the crude oil that poured into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` There still will be a mess on the beach, it still will have to be sucked up with absorbent pads, but at least it's not like <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, where you have to sandblast it, steam it off the rocks,'' said <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>. The odor of the spilled oil wafted through this tony seaside resort, where the shoreline is dotted with mansions. `` Boy, it's enough to knock you off your feet,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, who lives near the shore. The ship's master was identified as <PERSON> Iakovas </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> by Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said the skipper told him no pilot was aboard the tanker at the time of the crash. He said the captain also said he made a mistake in plotting the ship's course. Marine Safety Office officials said the ship had not come quite close enough to the bay to require a pilot, but that the ship so close that it was unwise of the captain to operate without one. `` It's kind of a gray area out there,'' said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>, a Marine Safety investigator. The governor said the state planned legal action, although he said it was too soon to talk about criminal charges. `` There was plenty of ocean there. There was no reason this terrible tragedy had to happen,'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reef </PERSON> is a nautical landmark where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup yacht races were held for many years. The tanker began its journey in <LOCATION> Bourgas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the ship is owned by the Greek-based <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but did not know who owns the cargo.

<TEXT>
 About 150,000 demonstrators today demanded <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> end oppression that has led thousands of ethnic Turks to flee <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The protest in <LOCATION> Taksim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was organized by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and True Path Parties. Organizers said thousands of ethnic Turks who immigrated to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> traveled to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> from many western and Thracian cities to attend the rally, which was broadcast live nationally on the state-run television. There were hundreds of red-and-white Turkish flags in the square, and banners hung from surrounding buildings denounced <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. Protesters carried banners saying, `` End Bulgarian Cruelty,'' `` Freedom for Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>,'' and `` The New <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>.'' Political leaders addressing the rally protested the expulsion of ethnic Turks by <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The crowd chanted slogans such as `` Murderer <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, army to <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>!'' and `` We want guns against <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>!'' In 1984, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> began forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian names and forbidding them to speak their language or practice their religion. Thousands of Turks began leaving <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> said May 29 that any Bulgarian citizen, including the 1-million-strong Turkish minority, could leave the country. Three weeks later, 250,000 Turks had applied for passports, and 150,000 of them reportedly received them immediately.

 At Q Soft, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plans for selling software in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are on the back burner. At an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a scheduled research trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by an aquatic weed specialist has been put on hold. But in <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Foxboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are in nightly touch by telephone and fax machine with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> colleagues at the company's electronics plant in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, six employes of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> supervise construction of a 28-story Intercontinental Hotel within walking distance of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> border. At the Sackler Gallery for Asian Art in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Museum of Art, people are lining up to view Chinese art exhibits, and plans for more such exhibitions are under way. And in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> has begun orientation sessions for 19 new teachers to teach English in Chinese schools. The warming of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> relations, which began with pingpong diplomacy, has blossomed into a patchwork of cultural and scientific ties, about $ 14 billion a year in two-way trade, and investment of some $ 3.4 billion in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by about 300 companies. An estimated 300,000 Americans visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year and more than 50,000 Chinese came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Approximately 62,500 Chinese students have enrolled in American schools since the beginning of the thaw in the early 1970's. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being criticized by some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for not acting more forcefully against the repressive tactics of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and was quoted by a senator Friday as saying `` there was a long road that was going to have to be traveled in that relationship and that we should n't move precipitously.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, supported the president's go-slow approach, but said trade relations between the two countries will nevertheless `` be cut back considerably.'' `` He's not cutting the ties, but the Chinese are doing it themselves, very clearly,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in an interview. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at odds since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover of the mainland in 1949, began their rapprochement with an exchange of table tennis teams in 1971. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> followed up with a visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1972 and diplomatic relations between the two countries were restored in 1979. `` The effort that has been done since <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s time till now is just going down the drain,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kousoum </LOCATION>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Q Soft, the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> computer software firm, had reportedly been exploring the possibility of selling its services to the Chinese national transportation system. `` Because of what happened in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the last few weeks, that definitely puts <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on the back burner for us,'' said <PERSON> Rawlein </PERSON> <PERSON> Soberano </PERSON>, director of program development for the company. `` We are not going to pursue it more actively until the political stability there is firmly established and things improve that would encourage us to pursue a viable business activity with that country.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION> vice president, said its <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> factory, employing about 500 people to make control systems for oil refineries and power plants, had turned a profit every year but the first since it opened six years ago as a joint venture with a Chinese company. `` Everything was normal right up until a few weeks ago,'' he said. The week after the shootings in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> square, the company withdrew the American executive who is deputy general manager of the plant. The other American employe on the scene, the chief engineer, was already back in <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION> on an assignment connected with his work for the Chinese plant. The men's families were also brought out. They are still in <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION>. `` But they are in communication with the plant every night by telephone, fax or telex and are participating in decisions and what have you and the plant is running in a more or less normal phase,'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said he anticipated a good chance of normal operation, although `` everything is problematical.'' `` There is certainly a continuing risk that some sort of sanctions could develop that would make it difficult for us to operate, because of the pressure both from the left and the right in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the president,'' he said. `` The president's present position would not seem to threaten ventures such as ours.'' From <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>, said its two major projects in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had not been affected. One is a nuclear power plant at <LOCATION> Daya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, about 50 miles up the coast from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, for which it is providing management services during construction. The other is the $ 640 million hotel it is building in <PERSON> Shanzhen </PERSON>. The company transferred the four Americans in its <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> office to <PERSON> Shanzhen </PERSON> after the disturbances, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a decision is planned during the coming week on whether to send them back. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> company in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> is keeping the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> office open. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> opened a research laboratory in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in December to help find natural enemies of insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries. Officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> was expected to send scientists to the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> lab this year. `` Everything as far as I know is on hold until we receive word,'' Ted Center, a research entomologist at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> who is the lead scientist for biological control projects on aquatic weeds, said. `` We had planned to have one of our scientists over there in July, and that trip has been canceled pending further developments. Nobody really knows what is going to happen.'' Other joint U.S.-Chinese scientific projects include research on rangeland weeds that are common in both countries, and an arrangement by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to study the greenhouse effect. In <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, more than 300,000 people have viewed the `` Sons of Heaven'' exhibition of more than 225 national treasures from 22 Chinese museums since it opened March 1. A show of brush-and-ink paintings by <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>, a 14-year-old Chinese prodigy, opens Sunday at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Sackler Gallery, and spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> said, `` We expect that the public will be very interested and will be coming.'' The child artist appeared at a preview at the gallery June 21. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nelson-Atkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who organized the exhibition, said planners feared that the disorder in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might affect it, `` but so far there is no sign of it.'' `` If they had wished to stop her from coming over they could have, but they did n't,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` She left well after the trouble.'' `` We are working with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on other projects, and we are proceeding,'' he said. `` We are not getting cold feet. If something happens to the projects, if they are postponed, canceled, put on the shelf, whatever, it will be on the Chinese side, not our side.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, a specialist in the council's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> program, said orientation began Friday for the group of new teachers for the English teaching program the council has been conducting jointly with Amity, its counterpart group in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, since 1985. `` We plan to send them in August,'' she said. `` Everyone has complete freedom along along the way to decide that they do n't want to go, but we have n't yet had any pullouts.''

 Two moderate earthquakes shook residents awake early today, but no damage or injuries were reported, a spokeswoman said. Two temblors, each measuring 4.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, struck five miles north of the town of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Well it really shook. I mean, you know, the windows rattled and you could just feel it,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, who works at the Wort Hotel in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. `` I thought, is somebody having a fight upstairs and breaking the furniture or are we having an earthquake? It was just a little hard to really tell.'' The first jolt hit at 3:25 a.m. MDT and the second temblor shook the area at 4:25 a.m. MDT, Ms. <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said. It was not immediately known whether the second shaker was an aftershock of the first quake, she said. A fault system has not yet been identified in the area of the temblors, although there have been earthquakes there in the past, she said. `` It has been some time since they have had any of this magnitude,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

 Each day, hundreds of trucks, buses and cars are in line at this border checkpoint, filled with ethnic Turks leaving this communist country in hopes of finding civil and religious freedom. `` I have left all my wealth behind, my house, my cattle, everything,'' said a farmer from the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Haskovo </LOCATION>, spreading his arms in despair as he waited with thousands of others to cross into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Many may face unemployment, deprivation and an uncertain future in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which has millions of citizens working in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because they can not make a living at home. But the Turks are leaving <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> anyway, driven by centuries of mutual suspicion, an assimilation campaign, and fears that arose after violent clashes with security forces in May killed at least seven ethnic Turks. Foreign observers in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, say the emigration of the Moslem Turks could be disastrous for both countries and a serious challenge to the 35-year rule of Bulgarian leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. Entire villages have been vacated, some factories have no workers and crops are left in the ground, causing enormous damage to the Bulgarian economy, according to a government adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. The exodus began after <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> announced May 29 that all Bulgarian citizens, including the 1 million Turks, could leave the country. Three weeks later, a quarter of a million Turks had applied for passports, and 150,000 of them had received one, according to Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON>. The rush to the passport office followed last month's clashes between security forces and ethnic Turks protesting the assimilation campaign, which began in 1984. The campaign forced all Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names, banned their language in public, and restricted their rights to practice the Moslem religion. The Bulgarians say seven people died in the unrest. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> estimate at least 30 ethnic Turks were killed. There always has been a mutual suspicion between Bulgarians and Turks rooted in 500 years of Ottoman rule in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Yet despite their lingering resentment of Turks, many ethnic Bulgarians privately concede that the campaign to force Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names was a mistake. Emotions are inflamed by a diplomatic war of words in which <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have blamed each other for starting the current problems. `` They whipped up a mass psychosis,'' <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON> said of the Turkish government. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, while strongly critical of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s actions, concede that Turkish radio broadcasts urging the ethnic Turks to put up `` moral and spiritual resistance'' to the Bulgarians' campaign do little to ease tensions. In public, both <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have voiced willingness to hold talks. But <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> rejects any agenda that includes discussion of a `` Turkish minority'' it insists no longer exists in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. By June 22, 55,000 ethnic Turks had crossed into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on their new passports, clutching any belongings they could carry. Hundreds of trucks, buses, cars and trolleys loaded with everything from household equipment to bedding and furniture jammed the Kapitan Andreevo border post in recent days, with passengers waiting up to three days to cross. Bulgarian drivers who refuse to drive across forced families out of the vehicles, making them walk into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> with their belongings. A couple searched desperately for their son in the confusion. A frail, white-haired woman lay limp on a makeshift sickbed in the back of a car. In a small town en route to <LOCATION> Kapitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreevo </LOCATION>, about 200 people waited outside a bank to withdraw money. `` They are buying whatever they can because they are allowed to take along only a limited sum'' when crossing into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, a Bulgarian explained. Why leave in such haste for an uncertain future? `` Above all, the names,'' said a Turkish woman. `` They do n't allow us to use our language and they are destroying our mosques,'' she added, refusing to give her name She said she knew of people in her native area of <LOCATION> Kardzhali </LOCATION>, an ethnic Turkish region in southeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, who were fined for using the Turkish language. `` I was given only three days to leave my home,'' said a gaunt man from the northern <LOCATION> Shumen </LOCATION> area. An old woman carrying an oil lamp told a Bulgarian reporter nearby, `` I'm sure there wo n't be any electricity at the place in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> where I will go.'' Several emigrants interviewed in the presence of Bulgarian reporters apparently feared reprisals when talking to a Westerner. Some said they were leaving only on `` an excursion.'' But the amount of luggage indicated they did not plan to return.

<HEAD>Plant Shutdown is Blow to Industry, but Chain Reaction Seen Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The shutdown of the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ the first forced by a voter initiative _ is adding to the industry's ills, but analysts doubt it will set off a chain reaction of plant closures. Rancho Seco began shutting down just hours after residents in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Utility </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> voted June 6 to pull the plug on a 15-year-old plant that suffered a history of expensive breakdowns and poor management. Anti-nuclear groups hailed the ballot result, and some suggested it could prove a catalyst for citizen initiatives against other nuclear plants. But early indications are that the fallout will be much less dramatic. `` The circumstances with <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> were unique to <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, so we're not going to have a domino effect,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based group opposed to nuclear power. He added, however, that because it focused on the economics of nuclear power, the Rancho Seco campaign may lead to broader interest in alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, and efforts to make more efficient use of all energy supplies. Thus in the longer run, he said, the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> vote may prove to be a milestone. `` We tend to think it's the last flapping of the tail after the fish has been pulled from the water,'' he said. Industry supporters say <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Seco </PERSON> was an aberration, noting that 15 other citizen initiatives against nuclear power prior to the Rancho Seco case failed. They see no indication that the public wants to throw out nuclear power. `` We think that <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> was not a vote against nuclear power, but a vote against the way that plant was run by upper management,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-nuclear group. The nuclear industry has been stagnating for more than a decade, partly because of public wariness about safety and partly because of economic problems. No utility has ordered a new nuclear plant since 1978 and many nuclear supporters agree with critics that no orders are likely before the turn of the century. `` I do n't know of a single chief executive officer in our industry that would bet his company on a nuclear plant,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group of privately owned utilities. He called the Rancho Seco vote `` not good for the public perception of nuclear power.'' Many nuclear plants are run efficiently, but those that are not have blackened the industry's image. Rancho Seco had a poor record, producing less than 40 percent of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-round operation _ far below the industry average. The utility district had to double its rates over the past four years to pay for plant improvements that cost more than the reactor itself. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't expect the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> vote to trigger a rash of citizen moves against nuclear power. He said the shutdown exposed an important weakness in the industry: the inability or unwillingness to force a poor-performing plant to change its ways. `` The industry knew very well that this was a terrible plant,'' he said, yet it turned a blind eye and in effect allowed nuclear critics to strengthen their hand. Several other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants are suffering from poor performance, and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 109 operating reactors, says it's losing patience with some of the laggards. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> raised the possibility of taking the extraordinary step of closing down two reactors at the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> power station in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because of poor performance. The reactors have been on the commission's list of worst-run nuclear stations since it began the rating system in 1986. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliffs </LOCATION> nuclear plant has fallen into a rapid decline. Less than two years ago it was given rave reviews by an international inspection team. Now it is listed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> as among the worst-run <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants. The plant shut down its two reactors in May because of mechanical problems, creating a revenue drain and prospects of power shortages in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area. Despite these and other problems, the nuclear industry faces a less vocal public opposition than in the immediate aftermath of the 1979 reactor accident at <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which was the most severe in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. There is relatively little organized campaigning, for example, to close <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> or Calvert Cliffs. Even the <LOCATION> Peach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bottom </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which was closed down for about two years by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> after control room operators were discovered sleeping on the job in 1987, faces little local opposition.

<HEAD>Loss Of Sleep Can Destroy Learning, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students who study hard Monday through Friday and then party all night on weekends may lose much of what they learned during the week, according to a sleep researcher. <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Trent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said that retaining of new, complex knowledge is a fragile thing that can be disrupted even by mild sleep deprivation during critical nights just after learning the information. `` It appears skewing the sleep cycle by just two hours can have this effect,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. This means that the sleep periods following a class or a study period can be as important to learning as the book work itself, he said. `` Watching a long, late movie the night following a class and then sleeping in the next morning will make it so you're not learning what you thought,'' he said. `` You'll not lose it all _ just about 30 percent.'' In a paper prepared for presentation Saturday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sleep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he researched the effects of sleep deprivation on learning by controlling the sleep of four groups of students after they had all been taught a complex logic game and a list of paired words. One group was deprived totally of sleep for the night after learning the task. That same night, another group was awakened whenever they slipped into the deep phase of slumber called rapid eye movement sleep, or REM. Another group was awakened during sleep periods that were not REM, and the fourth group was allowed to sleep normally. When tested a week later on the paired words, there was no learning deficit among any of the groups. But when tested on the complex logic game, the groups deprived of all sleep or of REM sleep all showed a learning deficit of 30 percent when compared to the other two groups. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in an interview, said that his earlier studies have shown that this same experiment conducted on the sleep cycle the third night after learning a task gives about the same results. Sleep deprivation the second night after learning, however, seems to have no effect. This means, he said, that the students who party all night on Friday after a tough week in school will lose 30 percent of the learning they acquired on Wednesday and on Friday. If they also lose sleep on Saturday, then Thursday's learning is also affected. `` There's a vulnerable time period -LRB- after learning -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` It has something to do with processing the material.'' He said studies monitoring REM sleep have shown steep increases in the length of such sleep on the first and third nights after learning a major task. The brain, he said, apparently needs these periods of rest to properly sort and store the information for later recall. If the brain is deprived of these rest periods, then about a third of the knowledge is lost forever. Complex tasks that require logical application of rules to new situations are the most critically affected. He said this would take in such subjects as math, physics, chemistry and foreign language. Word-based learning seemed little affected, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of people marched through a shopping district to the unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday to deliver a petition protesting the crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The two-hour rally and march by at least 5,000 people was the latest expression of anger by this British colony over Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of the pro-democracy movement. The crackdown, which has included arrests and some executions, has intensified fears over the return of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to Chinese rule in 1997. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> protesters began their demonstration at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where they gathered around a 33-foot-high replica of the `` Goddess of Democracy'' statue, which stood in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square before the military moved in June 3-4 to disperse pro-democracy demonstrators.

 A tranquil world away from the bloody violence in her native <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, 14-year-old artist <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> squatted barefoot on the <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION> gallery floor and demonstrated with lightning brush and ink strokes why she is called `` a very rare phenomenon anywhere in the world.'' It took the slight, muscular girl in jean shorts slightly more than a half-hour to fill her 8-foot-by-4-foot sheet of paper with pigments and ink, which she dripped, poured, smeared, dabbed and delicately brushed as she danced back and forth. `` In <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s hands, the brush sings and the ink dances,'' said one observer. <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> created a scene of two playful black monkeys _ her favorite animals _ gathering pears under the gaze of flitting songbirds and plump, dour hens. She called it `` The Happy Partners In the Orchard,'' stamped it with her name seals in red and shyly smiled for the first time, as the hushed crowd surrounding her in the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> Gallery burst into applause. `` I'm finished,'' she said through an interpreter. `` I'm very happy.'' Her display of extraordinary artistic talent took place at a press briefing last week before a collection of 69 of her paintings goes on display Sunday for a four-month engagement at the <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> museum of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> art. The show, `` Yani: the <ORGANIZATION> Brush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Innocence </ORGANIZATION>,'' will appear at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, from Dec. 16 to Jan. 28 and will be seen at the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Art </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> next March 7 through April 29. The exhibition was organized by the Nelson-Atkins museum and is sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Culture. The Chinese government's violent crackdown on pro-democracy student demonstrators in the past three weeks did not disrupt plans for the show, as some Sackler officials had feared. <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> and her father flew here from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> without incident. `` I have not felt there is going to be any effect on <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> in the future,'' said her father, artist <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiqiang </PERSON>, 44. Museum director <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> is `` a true prodigy'' whose fresh, spontaneous paintings of childlike humor and grace `` have an ability to communicate that is not limited by geography or age.'' She is the youngest artist to be honored with a one-person show in <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION> history, <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a Chinese art expert at the <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON>, said a prodigy of <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s gifts in the visual arts is `` a very rare phenomenon anywhere in the world.'' Born in a small village in rural <LOCATION> Guiangxi </LOCATION> province in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> started painting when she was 2. Her works were exhibited in three Chinese cities when she was 4, and since have been displayed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. She has turned out an estimated 10,000 paintings, but never had formal art training She said she once took art classes in school, but `` my work was disagreeable to my teacher, so I stopped going.'' Her father, who is an oil painter, has refused to coach <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> and even abandoned his own painting a few years ago to make sure she was not influenced by his own style of Western realism. `` Teaching may spoil her innate creativity,'' he said. `` Nature was her teacher,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> said she was intrigued by the animals at the local zoo, especially `` the monkeys who are like children playing in kindergarten'' in the mountains and gardens near her home. The exhibition starts with her brush-and-ink portrait of a kitten, done at age 3, and includes a 35-foot handscroll titled `` A Hundred Monkeys'' which she painted at age 9. As she grew older, <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s subjects have broadened to include her friends -LRB- `` <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s Party'' -RRB-, flowers -LRB- `` The Lotus Flowers Are So Pretty'' -RRB- and landscapes Later, more complex works include `` Last Night I Dreamt I Saw the Racing Egrets.'' Most of <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s paintings are stored in her home and none has been sold privately, although 44 of the works that her family gave to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government were sold to collectors, most of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, for an undetermined sum. <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s father says he was told that four small <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> paintings given to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> postal service for a postage stamp design in 1983 were sold to an unknown stamp collector for $ 13,000. <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> will return to the <LOCATION> Sackler </LOCATION> in September to give painting demonstrations for art teachers and school children. She will take her paintings back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but may leave an original with the <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON>, a museum spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in his first full term as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, is providing a consistent, crucial fifth vote to what has become a muscular conservative majority. `` He's the tie-breaking vote in almost every important issue in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> finds itself split,'' said a delighted <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said, `` What we feared has borne out. Justice <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> so far has proved a disaster.'' The court's 1988-89 term is entering its final week, and several important decisions are pending. Two will give <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> a chance to cast his first votes on the issues of abortion and church-state relations. The court is closely divided on both. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s voting pattern already is established, and it offers some surprises. Perhaps most remarkable is that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> statistically is a more faithful voting ally of the court's conservative leader, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, than is <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, a fellow appointee of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>'s judicial philosophy has been viewed as being far more ideologically conservative than <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s. But of this term's signed decisions not reached by a unanimous court, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> voted together in 90 percent; <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> were together in 86 percent. The number of 5-4 decisions to date this term is 27, down from the 41 recorded during the 1986-87 term when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s seat was occupied by the now-retired <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. But of 33 key decisions tracked by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, 14 have come on 5-4 votes. The court's most difficult and important decisions often come as its term winds down in June, and this year has been no different. Of 15 key decisions announced this month, the court has split 5-4 in 12 of them. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined or led the majority in 10 of the 12. In those, the court: _ Made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove on-the-job bias by using statistics _ Expanded the power of white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful `` reverse discrimination'' against them _ Shielded states and state officials from some civil rights lawsuits _ Made it more difficult to sue cities when their employees violate someone's civil rights _ Limited the scope of a key civil rights law, ruling that it does not apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment _ Ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed at bettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people _ Said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of suspected criminal defendants even if those assets were going to be used to hire a lawyer _ Ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers to death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals In two of June's 5-4 decisions, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court's liberal wing to rule that burning the American flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest and that states may be sued in federal courts for monetary damages in some environmental cases <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> also was a member of the majority in the flag-burning decision but the usually liberal-voting <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> in dissent. In most of the June 5-4 votes, the majority consisted of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, White and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The flag-burning vote aside, <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is all that we would have expected from <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, and more.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of conservative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The president's second choice, Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, had his nomination withdrawn after news reports that he smoked marijuana while a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because of his demeanor, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> might accomplish much more than <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Popeo </PERSON> said. `` He is quietly effective, a builder of coalitions.'' <LOCATION> Ms. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of NOW agreed, saying <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` is a <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> with a better style.'' `` The term ` red neck justice meted out with country club style' seems to fit,'' she said

<HEAD>Justice Investigates Kansas Company Accused of Stealing Oil From
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a criminal investigation of a Kansas-based company accused of stealing oil from Indian-owned wells, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee spokesman says. The probe stems from information about <ORGANIZATION> Koch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gathered by a special investigating committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said Friday. `` This has been referred to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney,'' confirmed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>. He said, however, that <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> officials and representatives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, would meet before a formal investigation begins. `` They -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office -RRB- will have to make a decision on whether to prosecute,'' said <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, director of public relations for <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. He said they may drop the probe after hearing <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s side of the story. He said no date had been set yet for the meeting. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said her office could `` neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing investigation.'' The special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee focused on <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the country's largest independent oil purchaser, at a May 10 hearing in which witnesses said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> employees purposefully mismeasured oil from wells on Indian lands In a 57-page statement issued June 8, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the committee `` unjustly defamed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and caused severe damage to its reputation and business.'' The lengthy document reviewed, point by point, the accusations against the 49-year-old oil company, which is based in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. It said the figures the committee used in its allegations were inaccurate, and that comparisons with other companies were based on noncomparable statistics. `` The committee stands firmly behind the findings released in its May hearings,'' <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said. `` The committee's investigators caught <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> employees in the act of stealing oil on six separate occasions. `` Koch gaugers and supervisors also admitted to committee investigators that it was company policy to mismeasure oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said documents the committee subpoenaed from <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION> and almost 30 other companies corroborated the committee's findings. He said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> executives were presented the findings during closed depositions and their responses were cited in the public hearings. `` <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was also given the opportunity to testify in our public hearings, but they would have been subject, of course, to cross examination by the attorneys who conducted our investigation,'' said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. Company representatives did not testify at the public hearings. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said the committee would review <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s June 8 statement before making its final report, sometime this fall. The special committee has been investigating all areas of Indian affairs and came upon the <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> case while probing federal agencies assigned to protecting Indian lands. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said the company `` never received a formal, informal, verbal or written invitation'' to testify. When asked if the company requested an opportunity to speak, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> did not feel it would be in its best interest to appear at the hearing because of its format. `` We can be hurt at a hearing,'' he said. `` They -LRB- the committee -RRB- ca n't be.'' In congressional hearings, witnesses usually submit lengthy written statements for the record and then are asked to summarize their comments, followed by questioning from the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and staff. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said that, unlike in a court of law, those being questioned have limited means to defend themselves and could be greatly damaged if the hearing were televised. In its June 8 statement, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the committee used `` anecdotal evidence which was misleading at best and false at worst'' at the hearing. Of witness <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON>, a homeless Cheyenne-Arapaho, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` Her problems obviously lie elsewhere and to suggest to this poor lady that <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is at fault is the height of demagoguery.'' The woman claimed her financial problems stemmed from infrequent, low royalty payments and that the leases on the wells in which she had part interest were sold to <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>. `` We heard that the well had been capped for two years, but that someone was stealing our oil because people saw trucks coming and going from the allotment,'' <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON> said in her testimony. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> owned the leases and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> bought the oil from <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>. He said the wells were never capped. He also pointed out that many people had interests in the wells and <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON>'s share was a small fraction of the amount <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> paid out to those people, explaining her small payments. Two other witnesses, <PERSON> Thurmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnita </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> testified their royalty checks dropped from $ 3,000 to $ 1,000 a month when <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> became involved with their leases. According to the company's statement, the brother and sister saw an increase in their payments. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> officials blamed a dissident family member, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, for the trouble, saying he had a `` vendetta against <ORGANIZATION> Koch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>.'' One of the witnesses who testified was an investigator who had worked for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, but a spokesman for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee made the first contact. `` In their zeal to get an oil company, and particularly one that was politically unimportant, the staff obviously seized upon the distorted information provided by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, embellished it with incorrect numbers, and, by withholding or ignoring evidence favorable to <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>, produced a totally unfair and one-sided hearing,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> asserted in its statement.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` measured response'' to the deadly crackdown on democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, urging the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to stand firm against `` a strange coalition of China-bashers'' who want harsh <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who as president reopened the door to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972, said punitive policies would be popular politically and satisfying emotionally, but would have no impact on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard line Communist leaders and would dash prospects for economic progress and eventual political reform. `` If in our anger we drive <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> back into the shadows of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the oppressive economic system <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has tried to reform, those who have died for freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will truly have died in vain,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said in an article written for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION> and distributed by his office. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said his journey to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972 was denounced by both the right and the left, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now faces criticism on both sides, too. `` Those on the far right who oppose any relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will demand economic and diplomatic sanctions,'' he said. `` So will the human rights lobby, which calls for punishing every regime that does not live up to our standards regardless of our interests or those of the millions living under those regimes, whom sanctions would hurt the most. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should continue to ignore these extremist voices and stay the prudent course it has already set,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suspended military aid and limited contacts with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, but has resisted demands in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for more stringent sanctions. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking targeted steps, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and preserving options for future action. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said that is the correct course. `` The Chinese got along without the West for a quarter century and they could do so again,'' he said. `` If we force them back into their angry isolation from the West, we risk prompting a potentially disastrous entente between the two great Communist powers.'' The ex-president said that would serve <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s interests, but no others. He said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> knows well that a freeze between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would hasten the thaw he seeks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Whatever happens in the future, it is imperative that Sino-American relations remain strong so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can help maintain the balance among <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. He said some Americans have gone overboard on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, seeing rapprochement as a romance. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a limitless capacity to fascinate,'' he said. `` But it is not Disneyland. It is, as it has been since 1949, a Communist dictatorship held together by brute force. `` No one who knows <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should be surprised when its leaders turn to violence to pursue their political goals,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` They have done far worse before Tiananmen Square.''

<HEAD>Senate Finance Committee To Consider Cutting Tax; Making Program

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Saturday he will propose cutting the surtax Medicare-eligible Americans pay for the new catastrophic illness insurance, and said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also will consider making the program voluntary. Despite opposition from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says he's backing a `` substantial cut'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic so-called supplemental premium that is based on income. The Finance chairman raised the possibility of cutting the tax several months ago if projections of large surpluses in the catastrophic fund were borne out. However, he previously had stopped short of saying he actually would propose a rollback. Enacted less than a year ago, the catastrophic tax has been under heavy fire from many older Americans in upper-income ranges and those who receive catastrophic insurance protection paid by the current or former employers. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the panel will meet in July to consider reducing the tax as well as making catastrophic health care coverage voluntary by linking it to Part B of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ the physician payment program that is financed 75 percent with general federal tax money. Since enacted this year, the catastrophic tax is estimated to produce a surplus of $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't think that the government ought to be making a profit off of the patients or the beneficiaries of this program, or to use that surplus to try to balance the budget,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. `` So I've set a hearing for July that will cover these points and to decide whether it should be made voluntary again, and, in turn, I'll be recommending a substantial cut in the premium,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s original plan, beneficiaries would have been able to drop Medicare coverage of physician fees and catastrophic insurance. But by the time the bill was finally approved, the catastrophic coverage was mandatory. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has yet to announce his position on the issue of making catastrophic coverage optional. The surtax this year is 15 percent of a Medicare beneficiary's federal income tax of $ 150 or more It is currently estimated that 59 percent of all beneficiaries will pay no supplemental premium in 1989, above the $ 4 basic fee, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s office said. Only 5.6 percent will pay the maximum surtax, set this year at $ 800, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s office said. The surtax is scheduled to be phased in through 1993; by then, it could reach 28 percent of a beneficiary's federal income tax of $ 150 or more. During the five years ending in 1993, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> now estimates, the surtax is likely to bring in about $ 10 billion more than is expected to be paid for catastrophic benefits. But administration officials have cautioned that the surplus may never exist, because the new program of catastrophic drug benefits starting in 1991 could cost far more than previously estimated.

 On the surface it is life as usual in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Beneath the surface there is fear _ of sudden arrest, of the knock on the door that means imprisonment or worse. Here is a report on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by an AP correspondent who reported on the pro-democracy demonstrations and the army crackdown.

 Tiananmen Square has been scrubbed clean of the blood and ashes that stained it the night of June 3-4, when thousands of soldiers crushed student-led protests for a freer society. The only signs of the violence are watchful soldiers brandishing automatic rifles, bullet holes in walls and scars left in the road by marauding army tanks. The burned-out hulks of hundreds of public buses and army trucks have been towed away. New flower beds and freshly painted traffic dividers and garbage bins adorn the 100-acre square, still closed to the public. Many Chinese say it's only window dressing. `` On the surface it's calm, but below that it's very tense,'' said a college student in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> who participated in the demonstrations at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. `` Many people are worried they might be arrested, like me.'' More than 1,600 have been arrested since the crackdown began, and 27 people have been executed. The government has demonstrated an ability for surveillance never so chillingly revealed in 40 years of communist rule. Television news has shown secretly shot videotapes of people authorities say spied for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s longtime enemy. Most scenes were of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where the accused were shown watching marches along with hundreds of thousands of other people. The message seemed to be that anybody could be on those tapes, and anybody could be charged with being a counterrevolutionary. Resignation and sullen indifference have replaced the grass-roots fervor that initially stopped the tanks of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from advancing on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Many businesses still are running at half-pace, and much of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s usual `` floating population'' of 1 million peddlers and outsiders looking for work has retreated to the countryside. `` Only about half the normal number of people are here,'' said a sales clerk at the Dongan Market on the normally jammed Wangfujing shopping street. `` Nobody is coming in from the provinces.'' Tibetan merchants who once hawked monkey skulls, tiger and bear paws and other animal parts for medicinal uses outside a foreigner's compound have disappeared Scarlet banners calling for people to support the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and respect the army flutter from hotels, construction cranes and overpasses. A month ago, Westerners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were symbols of freedom and hope. `` America is great,'' people would say heartily, flashing thumbs-up signs. `` Your democracy is the best in the world.'' Crowds would part to let foreign journalists see insulting caricatures of Chinese leaders or photograph corpses after the June 3-4 violence, which official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> reports say killed 200 to 300 people, including many soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. An AP reporter who was chased and shot at by two soldiers for photographing marching troops was cheered by a crowd when he emerged from a parking lot where he had been hiding behind a van. Now foreigners are shunned. Commuters wheeling their bicycles past memorials for two soldiers killed in the crackdown edged away uneasily when an American approached. Large signs tell how the two soldiers were thrown off bridges and, when they did n't die, set on fire by angry mobs. Witnesses said one soldier had shot to death a child and the other had shot unarmed adults. `` Please do n't sit here,'' a customer at an all-night restaurant asked a Westerner. `` They see us talking to you and they'll haul us in.'' The proprietor of a nearby restaurant was bolder, inviting an American to sit down and chat. Moments later, a platoon of soldiers marched by and its officer said, `` Get these tables off the sidewalk. They'd better be gone when we come back.'' `` Let them come back, what do we care,'' said the manager. But he moved the tables. Most people have become accustomed to the soldiers, who stare blankly out from under their helmets as they stand guard at street corners or patrol boulevards and back alleys. `` I'm just eating, I do n't care about them,'' said a young man at a restaurant on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main thoroughfare. `` They mind their business and I mind mine.'' Newscasts continue to show army officers, workers and even students denouncing the pro-democracy movement, and there are signs the propaganda campaign is working. `` There were a certain number of bad elements on the streets,'' said a 67-year-old man who has been repairing shoes on sidewalks for 50 years. `` The soldiers are n't after me, they're not after you. They're after the evildoers.'' But non-believers are legion. `` Not a single shot was fired in the square, and not one person died there,'' said a hired driver, reciting the government line. `` That's all we're allowed to say.'' Those who were on the streets or within earshot of the thunderous rifle reports of June 3-4 say they will never forget. `` This used to be our square of democracy,'' a college student said, looking across <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> toward the Great Hall of the People. `` Now it's their square of dictatorship.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military court on Saturday sentenced an Army soldier to 30 years in prison for passing sophisticated defense secrets to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to espionage charges during his court-martial and could have received a maximum sentence of life in prison. The judge, Col. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, said during sentencing that under a pretrial agreement, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s term would be reduced to 25 years for good behavior during the first three years of confinement. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, showed no emotion as <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> read the sentence. The soldier's parents, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, bowed their heads. After the sentencing, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was led in shackles to a van that whisked him away. Officials said he would be taken to a detention center in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>. The case automatically goes to a review panel and must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which has clemency power and can reduce the sentence. The court-martial also stripped <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> of his rank, ordered that all pay and benefits be forfeited and gave him a dishonorable discharge. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had also pleaded guilty to several lesser charges, including being absent without leave and entering a restricted zone without permission. In final arguments Saturday, chief prosecutor Maj. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> `` just flat sold out his country.'' `` He kissed off his friends, he kissed off his family, he kissed off his unit and then he kissed off his country,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s civilian defense lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, countered: `` He had courage to come back to face a life sentence and is probably as courageous as any soldier in battle.'' In testimony Friday, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> broke down in tears and pleaded for forgiveness. He said he received no money from the East Germans. When his court-martial opened Wednesday, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges he gave crucial information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic defense capabilities to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> worked as an electronic signal interceptor in the S-2 intelligence section of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s V <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. He disappeared from his unit Feb. 20 and crossed the border into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with a small computer and discs containing classified information. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> voluntarily returned March 4 and was arrested. In court Friday, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said he came back `` because I could n't handle leaving my parents behind, my friends behind Taking what I had coming was better.'' Under questioning from his military attorney, Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> cited job pressures and a lack of privacy in Army life as the reasons for his actions. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> declined to comment on the sentencing after Saturday's hearing. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said that during his stay in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, communist security officials in civilian clothes interrogated him at a house north of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Just before leaving <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said he asked communist officials to return the computer and discs, and they complied. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military prosecutors say it appears the East Germans copied the discs.

<TEXT>
 A stringent air cleanup plan considered by some a model for the nation has been shelved at least temporarily by state officials who fear it wo n't work unless it gains wider support. The state <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, citing mistrust between regional air quality officials and business and environmentalist leaders, voted 6-1 Friday to postpone action on the plan for 60 days. `` I'm troubled by the perceptions of this plan I continue to hear from business and local government,'' said <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>, the board's chairwoman. The plan would cut emissions from vehicles, businesses and residences about 80 percent in an effort to make the air in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> healthy again by 2007. It would also place restrictions on the use of such consumer products as aerosol sprays and barbecue lighter fluids. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and three counties to the south and west, have estimated the plan would cost $ 2.6 billion a year. Business estimates have placed the cost as high as $ 12 billion. In delaying a vote, the board ordered the district to outline how it plans to account for the costs businesses will face. The board also wants to know how cities and counties will be persuaded to cooperate in enforcement. `` We have to ensure this plan can be implemented,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON> said. `` We want a plan that works.'' If adopted by the state board, appointed by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, the plan also would require approval from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s environmental affairs secretary, said the governor did not advise her to reject the plan, but said he wanted the concerns of business better addressed. `` The governor is concerned about the impact on the economy,'' she said.

 Residents of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs are co-existing a little more uneasily with Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant these days, but say an investigation at the facility is cause for concern, not hysteria. `` We're all concerned, naturally,'' said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who has lived and worked in <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION> for 23 years. `` What are you going to do? As a citizen you just hold your breath and hope for the best.'' `` We're not panicky by any means,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>. `` We are mad for the simple reason that I think we're being lied to. The investigation was made public June 6 when 75 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> agents raided the plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The on-scene inquiry wound up last week. Authorities have said it will take at least six months to analyze the evidence collected during the two-week search. An affidavit filed in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> alleges that hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plant incinerator and were dumped late last year into creeks feeding into water supplies for <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Northglenn </LOCATION>. A group of 16 anti-nuclear and peace organizations has demanded that Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> close the plant. Other groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, supported <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>'s successful effort to give the state authority to more strictly monitor the plant, which is under federal contract. The probe has had little visible effect on day-to-day life in the nearby suburbs of <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION>, where 155,000 of metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s roughly 1.6 million residents live. But people in those suburbs are concerned, particularly about the safety of their water, city leaders and residents say. Sales of bottled and distilled water systems are up. `` My gut feeling is that the people in <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> have accepted it and the city has been very responsive,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, editor of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Broomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` I'm getting more letters over an animal impound issue we have here than over Rocky Flats.'' `` We've been in <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> since 1964 and we've known Rocky Flats has been there all along,'' said resident <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. `` Our water supply is always in jeopardy because we are so close to it. `` I really expected a lot more panic,'' he said. `` Everybody is concerned; everybody knows Rocky Flats is there. Let's make sure we know what they're doing there and let's clean it up.'' `` I think there's a group that certainly is concerned about the overall environmental safety, taking a wait-and-see attitude to see what the investigation will produce,'' said Westminster City Manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. `` There also is a silent element that is not expressing concern, not jumping up and down, not demanding the closure of the plant, not very concerned with what's been in the media. `` There also is a very small vociferous group that is demanding the closure of the plant, and we've heard from those people for the last few years,'' he said. Established in the early 1950s, the plant _ a large complex of buildings surrounded by a buffer zone, the whole site covering 11 square miles _ manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons. It has been a source of controversy in the metropolitan area for two decades. Whenever public safety concerns surfaced, the federal government reassured the public that the facility posed no health threat. A wave of concern erupted in 1957, when a fire and explosion in a plutonium-reprocessing building released an undetermined amount of plutonium into the atmosphere; and again in 1969 when a fire caused about $ 70 million in damage. In the 1970s, then-Jefferson County Health Director Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> began studies of the plant's impact. He later published papers in which he claimed the cancer rate among nearby residents shot up in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, about 5,000 people work at the plant, and many live in the nearby towns, which were established primarily as bedroom communities. Recently, the towns have taken steps to attract business and industry and diversify their economic base. The plant is managed by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. The news of the latest investigation initially triggered hundreds of calls to the <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> city offices, which opened a hotline to reassure citizens that tests proved the water was safe. But a week or so later, no one addressed the issue during a city council meeting. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said he purchased bottled water after learning of the alleged contamination, but his family is returning to tap water because of uncertainty over what type of elements are in bottled water. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> for five years, and has drunk tap water during that time, said, `` It's not going to make a difference to buy bottled water now.'' `` As far as what has happened, we will probably go on living our lives the same way as before,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Broomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` As far as business and economic development is concerned, the damage has been done. `` We're not born with four arms out here,'' he said. `` This is not a war zone.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fired its moderate leader, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, on Saturday and replaced him with a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party boss who moved swiftly to quell pro-democracy protests in his city. The new general secretary of the 47-million-member party is <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, 62, a university-educated technocrat who has served as mayor and party secretary of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city. The first three executions following the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement occurred in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. The party also purged <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, who shared the 69-year-old <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s sympathy for the student-led movement for a freer society and served with him on the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's highest-ranking political <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s status had been in limbo for more than a month. He was last seen in public when he met with student protesters, whose 7-week-old movement was crushed in a crackdown that began June 3. The party's 276-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also removed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> from the 17-member ruling Politburo and its <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, from the 175-member policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He apparently was allowed to keep his party membership. A party communique, released by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said `` that at a critical juncture involving the destiny of the party and the state, comrade <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> made the mistake of supporting the turmoils and splitting the party, and he had unshirkable responsibilities for the shaping-up of the turmoils.'' The party said it will maintain its policies of reform and greater openness with the rest of the world. It also pledged to work for greater democracy and an end to corruption, the main demands of the student protesters. The report on <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s ouster was read by his rival, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who joined with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to consolidate the power of hard-liners determined to use force to crush the pro-democracy movement. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> reportedly was stripped of power after opposing <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decision to declare martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20 <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was last seen in public the day before, when he made a dramatic, tearful visit to students on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The party's communique said he took a `` passive approach'' to opposing bourgeois liberalization, or support of Western ideas, and `` gravely neglected party building.'' It acknowledged, however, that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> `` did something beneficial to the reform, the opening of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the outside world.'' The communique did not accuse him of being a counterrevolutionary, a charge leveled at many of the 1,800 civilians arrested since the crackdown began. The government has executed 27 of them. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> gained national acclaim with his rural reforms in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in the late 1970s. He became a Deng protege and was named premier in 1980. He was appointed party general secretary in 1987, succeeding the late <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Hu, another <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> protege, was purged following accusations that he was soft on student demonstrations. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death April 15 triggered the latest round of demonstrations. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a university graduate who spent time in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1950s and speaks Russian and English, served as electronics industry minister and in various other technical posts before being named mayor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in 1985. He relinquished that position to become <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party secretary last year. Like <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, he is comfortable around foreigners and has backed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s open-door policy by working to attract foreign investment to help revitalize <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s antiquated industrial base. Politically, however, he is considered a hard-liner. During the student protests he tried to censor <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, then <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most liberal newspaper, and he moved quickly to stifle unrest in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> that followed the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> is believed to be the son-in-law of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, a former president and one of the Old Guard hard-liners who rallied behind <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decision to suppress the student movement with force. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> also joined the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was expanded from five to six members. Replacing <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON> were <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON> and economist <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON>, who heads the party <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

The party shakeup was not expected to have any immediate effect on its policy of promoting foreign investment and expanding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic relations with other countries The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s communique said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` must not return to the old closed-door path.'' While it said the party must work for democratic and legal reforms, it demanded loyalty to conservative ideals. The party must `` carry out education in patriotism, socialism, independence and self-reliance, plain living and hard work, and oppose bourgeois liberalization in real earnest,'' the committee said. The communique said the Politburo met from Monday through Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which makes all decisions on leadership positions, met on Friday and Saturday.

<HEAD>Before Killing Himself, Boy Called Shooting `a Nightmare'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Before turning the gun on himself, a 14-year-old boy wrote a note to his mother saying that shooting his 12-year-old brother to death was `` a nightmare,'' authorities say. `` Mom, I accidentally shot Clay. It's a nightmare, so I killed myself,'' read the note that <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> <PERSON> Bienash </PERSON> left on the back of a cash register receipt on the dining room table. The one-line statement was found when the boys' mother, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bienash </PERSON>, 36, returned home Thursday afternoon and found the bodies of her sons <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>. Police and <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chief deputy coroner, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, concluded that the deaths were a murder-suicide although friends and relatives of the victims disputed the notion. Authorities said a quarrel over baseball cards may have led <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> to shoot his younger brother with a gun that had been a gift to the older boy from his father. `` There are only two people who could tell us why it happened, and they are both dead,'' Police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveland </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, an aunt, said Friday that the incident `` was an accident, a total accident. It is not like them at all. They loved each other too dearly. They always looked out for each other.'' According to police reports, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was shot `` basically square in the face,'' indicating the shot from <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> may have been aimed. A knife was found near <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>'s right hand, and there were signs, including a large fan that was tipped over, that indicated there may have been a struggle, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said. A number of baseball cards were found on the floor near <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>'s feet Police said the boys were quarreling over baseball cards before their mother left earlier in the day. `` Clay, apparently, was an avid baseball card collector,'' <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> said, `` and <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> grabbed a handful of them. That may not have been the cause -LRB- of the shooting -RRB-, but that's the last thing the mother saw.'' `` Apparently they had had altercations off and on,'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said. `` I think they were awfully good kids, but had altercations a little more often than normal.'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said a single-shot, 20-gauge shotgun, a gift to <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> from his father, was used in the shootings. The parents are divorced. The boys' aunt said the boy had taken a hunter safety course. The deaths, coupled with a shooting in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> on Thursday evening in which a boy critically wounded a friend while playing with a gun, led to renewed calls at the state Capitol for a Florida-style gun law. The law passed last week in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after a spate of child shootings there imposes penalties on adults who allow loaded weapons to come into the hands of children and allows authorities to prosecute the adult for a felony if a child's play with a weapon results in death or injury.

<UNK>Gorbachev Protege, Minister Candidates, Rejected by Soviet Legislature</UNK>

<TEXT>
 A legislative committee rejected the nomination of a protege of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to head the government's food program, Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported Saturday The rejection is the latest indication that the recently reorganized Supreme Soviet was breaking from its traditional role of automatically approving decisions of the ruling elite. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> failed to win a Supreme Soviet committee's endorsement as first deputy premier. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> nominated <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> on June 10, saying he had vast experience in agriculture and should head a new government Commission on Food and Purchases. <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> began his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> career under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, serving as agriculture chief in the region while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was party chief there. His most recent jobs have been party chief in <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION> and member of a party agriculture commission. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did not say why or when the committee rejected Kalashnikov but noted the full legislature still could approve him. The committees began hearings on Monday on 13 <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> aides and more than 50 ministers in an exercise of the new powers they gained under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms. The 542-member Supreme Soviet is to meet for 40 days to confirm the appointees and begin drafting legislation. Legislative committees also turned down the nomination of <PERSON> Polad </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polad-Zade </PERSON>, who was recommended for promotion from first deputy to minister of land reclamation and water resources, Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said. Committees also rejected <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribov </PERSON>, who was to move from his post as a department chief in the state planning agency, <LOCATION> Gosplan </LOCATION>, to chairman of the board of the state bank. Also rejected was the nomination of <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON> to continue as culture minister, a post he has held for nearly three years, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. Also Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency released a resolution adopted by the Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, that calls for major improvements in the economy. The resolution was adopted during the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' inaugural sesssion from May 25 to June 9. The resolution, outlined for the first time on Saturday, demands improvements in housing, food and consumer goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a bicameral part-time legislature that was created as part of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s social reforms. Elections earlier this year included opposition candidates and represented the first contested elections under communist rule. The Supreme Soviet is a standing legislature made up of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members that was given broader powers by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners on Saturday fought their fiercest artillery duels in a month around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding mountains. Police said three people were wounded. A police spokesman said the shelling declined after daybreak into intermittent mortar exchanges across the capital's dividing Green Line. He said two men and a woman were wounded before dawn in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, which was hammered all night by Syrian gunners deployed in the city's western Moslem sector. The casualty toll from the 14-week confrontation between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s units and the Syrians stood at 373 people killed and 1,460 wounded. The coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took the brunt of the Syrian barrage, which was aimed at maintaining a blockade of the 310-square-mile Christian heartland. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners fired back at Syrian artillery emplacements along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside boulevard. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with police rules, said about 520 shells and rockets exploded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s two sectors and the Christian coastline in a 12-hour period. It was a sharp escalation of the daily shelling that has marked the Syrian-Christian confrontation since an Arab summit called for a cease-fire on May 26. The fierce clashes followed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s call Friday for international pressure on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to lift its siege of the Christian enclave. The Syrians began battering the area March 14, eight days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps 40,000 troops stationed across 70 percent of the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> governments have been competing for power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since September, when outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> head of an interim Christian cabinet. Moslems and leftists refused to accept <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who governed during <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s presidency. Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said it lost five `` martyrs'' in a confrontation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and allied militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley on Friday. The party said four of its fighters were wounded and four others were missing. About 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members chanting `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, death to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' took part in a funeral procession in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> for the slain guerrillas.

Lebanese police said about 300 Israeli soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen in 35 armored personnel carriers launched the sweep of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> strongholds. Israeli military officials said Friday four guerrillas were killed and one Israeli was slightly wounded in the clash.

 A volunteer firefighter says he and a friend firebombed a small chemical plant with gasoline they got from the fire station because they believed the plant was harming the environment. He said in a police affidavit that he did not intend for the blaze to get `` out of hand.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Legge </PERSON>, 19, a probationary volunteer for the <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON> fire department, was in jail Saturday unable to post $ 40,000 bail. His friend, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Golembowski </PERSON>, 22, a self-employed landscaper also of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, was free after posting $ 30,000 bond following their arraignment Friday on charges of first-degree arson, conspiracy to commit first-degree arson and first-degree reckless endangerment. If convicted, they could face maximum prison terms of from 12 to 46 years and fines of $ 21,000 each. Neither man has yet entered a plea. <PERSON> Golembowski </PERSON> has denied parts of <PERSON> Legge </PERSON>'s version given to police. The fire early Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Carbolabs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in rural <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> spewed a cloud of noxious smoke that forced the evacuation of as many as 200 people and sickened 14 firefighters, who were treated for respiratory complaints. One firefighter was hospitalized. The arsonists `` did more environmental damage in one hour than we did in 22 years'' of business, said Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pivawer </PERSON>, a Carbolabs owner. <PERSON> Legge </PERSON>, who lives three-quarters of a mile from <LOCATION> Carbolabs </LOCATION>, said in the affidavit that he telephoned state police to report the fire as soon as he got home early Monday morning because he did not want the fire `` to get out of hand.'' <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> was questioned by state police after the resident trooper in <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> identified his voice on the tape recording of the call made to report the fire. The trooper recently had arrested <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> for an unspecified offense. <PERSON> Golembowski </PERSON> told police he was with <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> when he prepared several homemade bombs known as Molotov cocktails. But he said he refused to take part in the firebombing or to even drive <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> to the laboratory, as <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> said occurred. Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ecker </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Golembowski </PERSON> at his arraignment, told the court that what `` might have begun as a game or a prank indeed escalated into something serious.'' <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> said in the affidavit that before making the Molotov cocktails, they went to the fire station to pick up a two-gallon can of gas used to run emergency generators. A search of <PERSON> Legge </PERSON>'s home turned up two red gas cans marked BVFD, for the <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Advisory Council Says Action Needed Before All Uncertainties Known</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must step up its attention to such environmental issues as drought management, infrastructure repair, global warming and solid waste disposal to mitigate the pollution that threatens its people, an administration report says. `` We must do better,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, putting in a plug for recycling of wastes in a message accompanying a report by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisory Council on Environmental Quality. The 420-page report urged movement on the controversial issue of global warming, on which some in the administration have cited differing scientific opinions and shown reluctance to accept dire predictions regarding the so-called greenhouse effect. The report, put together over a two-year period and forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late Friday, states that the government might find it necessary to plan `` future projects considering climate change even before all the uncertainties are known.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said significant strides have been made by the federal and local governments as well as the private sector `` to address pollution and environmental degradation'' with such steps as auto emissions standards. `` But we can do better,'' he wrote in a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is why we are committed to cleaner air in the nation's cities,'' he said, noting that he has proposed a clean air package to deal with acid rain, airborne toxics and auto-produced smog In addition, he said, `` This country must make every effort to stem the rising tide of garbage and industrial waste through a more aggressive use of waste minimization and recycling practices.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said recycling should start with separation of garbage in homes and in local communities. The report, an assessment of the nation's environmental status for the years 1987-88 drawn from a variety of agency and military studies and scientific reports, makes clear the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will not assume the full burden of environmental protection. It calls on state and local governments as well as business to share the responsibility. For instance, more than half the nation's municipal landfills `` make no attempt to control water pollution resulting from the runoff of rain water from their sites,'' the report says. `` Less than half impose restrictions on receipt of bulk liquid wastes. These and other practices suggest that a large portion of landfilled municipal solid waste ends up in places where it might contaminate ground water.'' It notes further that the country has thousands of old dumping sites in the middle of residential areas, and that the federal government's Superfund cleanup program will share responsibility for only a handful of them. Regarding the nation's infrastructure, the report says such facilities as navigation channels and ports, flood control works, mass transit systems, water supply, wastewater and solid waste facilities are `` barely adequate to fulfill current requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth and development.'' Given the experience of the 1988 drought, in which extensive dredging and water control management was required to keep inland waterways open for commerce, the report notes that `` formal, planned drought management has not been a major federal focus,'' and that it will be an important water resources issue in the future. The report takes a cautious approach to the greenhouse effect, in which carbon dioxide and other gases in the earth's atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition to natural buildup, the gases have increased dramatically because of burning coal, oil, and gas, as well as the destruction of tropical rain forests. In light of the massive economic upheaval that would be caused if the government found it necessary to declare war on the greenhouse effect, the administration has taken the position that evidence is inconclusive on whether the trend is as serious as some analysts have found. Noting the disagreements, the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION> report says the scientific evidence is `` evolving'' on the extend of global warming and its potential impact on weather patterns. `` It may be necessary, however, to plan future projects considering climate change even before all the uncertainties are known,'' the report said. `` In the interim, support of necessary new research and thorough evaluation of ongoing and completed research is needed.'' The three-member Council on Environmental Quality was established in 1970 to advise the president on environmental matters and has few statutory powers. One of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first acts was to slash its staff, and the council did little during his presidency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so far has not shown an inclination to raise the council's profile However, environmentalists were heartened when the president tapped <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, to be its new chairman. He was the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and is known as a strong environmentalist.

<TEXT>
 At least 31 people died Saturday and 50 were seriously hurt when a rural highway caved in and two crowded buses tumbled into a 100-foot hole, rescue officials said. The accident occurred at 2:30 a.m. near the rural town of <LOCATION> Estancia </LOCATION>, about 1,150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Estancia </LOCATION> is in the state of <LOCATION> Sergipe </LOCATION>. The buses, each jammed with 48 travelers, were making the 56-hour, 2,030-mile trek from the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>, federal police officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Estancia </LOCATION>. `` They were riding along a high ridge when the road simply gave way beneath them,'' said <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who assisted rescue workers at the scene. `` A hole the diameter of two buses opened up and sucked them down the drop. It's pitch black out on that highway _ the drivers probably never saw a thing.'' `` It's a miracle anyone survived at all,'' he said. One driver was killed, and the other was pulled from the wreckage by rescue workers, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. A rescue team of 50 civil and federal police and firefighters was digging through the mud in search of bodies and possible survivors. `` We've pulled 31 mutilated corpses from the mud and we think there must be dozens more buried underneath,'' said <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. He said no foreigners were on board the buses. TV film footage on <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest commercial network, showed helmeted rescue workers with spades and hoes hacking through earth and pulling mud-covered bodies from the wrecks. Firefighter <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that heavy rains in the region over the past week probably caused the highway to fall away. `` That region is hilly and the earth beneath on both sides of the drop that runs alongside the highway was already loose and crumbling,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON>. `` The rains turned the ground into putty.''

 In 20 years of running roughshod through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a tenants' rights activist, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> turned landlords into enemies. He turned drug dealers into enemies. But he also turned friends into enemies. One of his enemies murdered and dismembered <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> on June 14. Police are still trying to determine which one. `` We know there are a lot of people who do n't like him,'' said Detective Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON>, who is heading the investigation into the slaying that ended <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s two-decade tenure as an Upper West Side gadfly. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 54, was on his way to a tenants organization meeting when he disappeared. Parts of his body were found a day later in several garbage bags in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, with his limbs and head severed. Police, acting on a tip, searched a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> landfill Saturday for the head. `` One fact is crystal clear to those who knew <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>'s life and work: This is no random act of violence,'' said a statement issued by his wife, <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON>, and their two children. `` This was a deliberate political murder, no different from the acts of a death squad in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` We strongly believe that some real estate thug found, as all the others have, that <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> could n't be bought, could n't be frightened, could n't be discouraged. But he could, of course, be killed.'' His slaying produced an outpouring of grief and support from some of the people he assisted. A bouquet of five roses was left outside the door of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> headed. `` 5 Roses from Apt. 5E'' read the card. `` He saved our building and many others. The building was a disaster before he came in, and he helped us put it back together,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> of the 125th Street tenants group that <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was scheduled to meet the night he was killed. While <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was praised by many, others suggested his pro-tenant work was just a way of exploiting an issue for personal gain. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since his college years, when he transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after a year at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> a short time later; at the time of his death, he was its chairman and only paid staff member. When <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> first became active in tenants rights, `` you could count on <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> to show up with the troops,'' recalled former state assemblywoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, a one-time <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> associate who wound up at odds with him. He soon gained a reputation as someone willing to take on a fight, organizing rent strikes, filing lawsuits and ripping landlords as `` vicious and treacherous'' as they battled head-to-head. But there was a darker side to <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. He was accused of anti-Semitism by Holocaust survivor and fellow <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranz </PERSON>, who was later shoved down a staircase by two men at <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s order. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was convicted of the crime and given a six-month sentence, which he never served. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was also the target of a probe by the state attorney general's office after tenant union members alleged that he was misusing funds of the not-for-profit organization. No charges were ever filed. While his work initially focused on <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> University-owned buildings, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> had expanded his efforts to include buildings in drug-ravaged sections of the city: <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> were also included. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> began infuriating drug dealers used to operating without any interference. The day he disappeared, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> had been in suburban <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, trying to persuade a landlord to evict drug dealers from a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building. It was n't surprising to anyone who knew <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> that he took them on the same way he handled everyone else. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> was not well-liked by anyone _ except the tenants he was working for,'' said attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, who represented tenants in six Bailey-organized buildings. And <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, like the <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> family, believes his friend's life work might have led to his death. When he was informed about <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s disappearance, <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> immediately thought the worst. `` I was very concerned, because we were working on several projects where landlords were capable of using violence,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON>, the Republican mayor of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, spoke too soon when he explained last week why city leaders of both parties agreed on the need for higher federal taxes, and why their annual meetings had become such dull, bipartisan affairs. `` There's always a little'' partisanship, he said, `` but not as much as there used to be. ... The cuts in federal programs for cities over the past seven or eight years have pulled us together.'' By the conclusion of the annual <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> a few days later in this historic seaport, they still agreed on taxes and urban spending. But partisanship had flared openly in a way not seen among the local leaders since the early years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The leading Republican mayors did n't bother to show up for a closing news conference. They were licking their wounds from a bruising battle over electing future leaders for the group that saw <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON> the loser of an unprecedented party-lines vote. And their meeting seemed to demonstrate that political bitterness after the upheaval in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership will spread to other levels. The mayors' meeting had slid into partisan argument with the arrival of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who said he had targeted the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral race as a way to establish a `` political beachhead'' in the cities. Even some Republican mayors were left complaining about its partisan tone and that it was the kind of speech appropriate for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> workers _ not a gathering of mayors where the majority was Democratic. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, arriving the next day, had n't sat down yet when he unleashed a bitter assault on <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, calling him a `` amoral,'' `` pathological'' and engineer of `` vile'' tactics <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> followed with an attack on <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as purveyor of `` oil spill'' tactics, taking politics `` to its worst extreme.'' But Democratic mayors were left with a dispute among themselves, too, and it cut to the heart of how they want to be advocates for the nation's urban problems in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The incoming president of the conference, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, used the meeting to voice optimism about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration being more attentive to urban problems than the mayors feel <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was. She said of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials who spoke, `` After hearing from them, we are optimistic that our issues will be on their agenda.'' But the mayors, who select their president two years in advance, pushed aside <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidacy to be future president of the group and elected <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> _ who is among the sharpest critics of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration among the mayors. That there was a contested election at all was unprecedented in the long history of big-city mayors meetings. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> immediately made clear he did n't think <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> would be a tough enough critic of the administration, and that the debate had been over how agressive big-city mayors want to be in pressing their case with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Where <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> had praise for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said pointedly: `` I did n't think they had much to say about anything. We ca n't sit back and applaud that kind of rhetoric. ... There's too much of ` one big happy family.''' Lost in the mayors' meeting was any real airing of the scandals plaguing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that handles most federal urban spending and which is engulfed in allegations of political favoritism, fraud and embezzlement from the previous administration. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, who is in a tough re-election battle in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home town, said she was n't interested in debating any past abuses and would look to the future. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said revelations that the limited money for housing may have been squandered `` just leave everybody depressed.'' There was also much concern voiced privately that the investigative trails would lead into other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs popular with mayors. Former Secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who directed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has never been popular with mayors, and he had no defenders at this meeting. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has not been very sensitive to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Anybody tht says <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been in the corner of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities for the last eight or nine years does n't know what they're talking about

<HEAD>Applications Triple For Second Gator Hunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s second annual alligator hunt has drawn more than 20,000 applicants, or about three times what last year's hunt drew. `` We were a little bit surprised. I estimated we would get double, but not triple,'' last year's applications said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, alligator program coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> said 20,361 people applied before the June 15 deadline, leaving about 80 hopefuls for every permit to be granted. The commission brought back gator hunting, in limited numbers, after a 25-year ban when alligators were counted as an endangered species. They now number over a million and have become a nuisance in some areas. About 250 to 300 trappers will be randomly selected by a computerized lottery for the 30-day hunt in September. Last year, a computer sorted through 5,800 applications to select the 238 trappers that were given hunt permits. Hunters are allowed 15 gators each. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents selected in the lottery must pay a hunt license fee of $ 250. The fee for out-of-state residents is $ 1,000. Last year's trappers bagged 2,988 alligators, 582 alligators short of the hunt's allotted amount. The game commission made one significant rule change for the second hunt after receiving complaints of brutality toward alligators: Trappers are now required to kill their captured quarry immediately, instead of binding live alligators until they are delivered to a meat processor.

<HEAD>Boeing's Billing Practices, Health Record Under Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the billing practices of The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on research and development costs for government contracts, the company said. Meanwile, a separate investigation by state and federal inspectors is focused on health and safty concerns at top-security <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> declined to provide details of the billing practices probe, but he did confirm Friday that an investigation is under way. `` We have supplied documents and we are cooperating in the investigation,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions that it has obtained internal <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> memos that say the company is under subpoena from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to preserve certain documents between Jan. 1, 1979, and Aug. 31, 1988. `` The subpoena is currently so broad that virtually all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> contracts, proposals, associated files, technical documentation, working files, notes, etc. can be subject to being requested by the government,'' the memo said. It was dated June 7 and distributed to key employees telling them that none of the documents in question should be destroyed or removed. A memo dated June 13 named the target as the Sea Lance program, an anti-submarine weapon <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is developing for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported. Both memos referred to the probe as a criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. This year <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was awarded $ 85 million for research and development of the Sea Lance, a conventional warhead being developed to attack submarines at long range from surface ships and other submarines. The six-year contract, potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was first signed in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which receives billions of dollars' from the federal government for defense contracts annually, is routinely audited by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. If irregularities are found in any procedures, the agency can refer the matter to its own investigative branch or to the appropriate armed service. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedal </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, declined to answer questions regarding the investigation. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is considered an ethical defense contractor. But, he said, that does n't mean the company would be immune from improper billing. `` There's always a risk that somewhere in the many programs they have and the thousands of people involved that someone is going to slip up,'' he said. In another development, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> official in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the health and safety investigation has been under way since May 18. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, assistant regional administrator for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, declined to say what prompted the investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company strives to have a good health and safety program. `` It's almost a given that they're going to find something wrong. ... They do n't come in to tell us what's right,'' he said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Valandra </PERSON>, spokesman for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> was asked to help perform the safety and health review with state officials because state officials have had trouble getting security clearance in the past.

Although he has the experience and the right political stance for the job, he lacks a power base. `` His base is his popularity, but in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that's not enough,'' said one Chinese source in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> who is familiar with <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s family `` He has no organizations behind him, like the military or the state security organs. `` If the senior leaders want him to do something, he'll have no choice.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has been party secretary of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, and a member of the 17-member Politburo, the party's top decision-making body. From 1985 until last year he was mayor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, aggressively promoting it as a financial and foreign investment center and tackling the daunting transportation and housing problems of the city of 12 million. `` <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> is politically hard-line and economically liberal,'' said the Chinese source. `` He likes good food and dresses well, too.

Among the joint ventures <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has brought to his city are the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most luxurious hotels. He has also worked with <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to establish a golf course in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the source said. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> made an impressive showing last month when he played host to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to the city. The two talked about economic reforms. `` He has a combination of suaveness but also a history of managing difficult situations that undoubtedly recommended him for this job,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, an instructor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and visiting scholar at the University of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, who spent the second half of 1988 in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> lost some popularity among <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> citizens for `` representing <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at least as well as he represented them,'' and for his recent moves against the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most liberal newspaper before it was shut down in May <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> moved swiftly to arrest protesters and quell demonstrations that broke out in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> after the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4. The first Chinese condemned for participating in the protest movement were three <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> men who were executed Wednesday. The Chinese source said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was supported by his two relatively liberal predecessors, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, and has always had a good relationship with intellectuals. His ties with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and intellectuals were strained, however, after <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> moved to censor the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and its editor <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>, the source said. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was born in July 1926 in <LOCATION> Yangzhou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1946. A year later he graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jiaotong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. He worked as a trainee at an automobile factory in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1955, then returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the next year to become deputy chief engineer for dynamic mechanics at a plant in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, like most bureaucrats of his generation, apparently was purged from office during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He reappeared in 1980 as a senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Import and Export Affairs and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Investment. He went on to be named minister of electronics industry and in 1985 returned to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> as mayor and deputy secretary of the party committee. In 1986, during student demonstrations in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, he went to his alma mater and, seeing a poster with Chinese-language excerpts from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Address </ORGANIZATION>, surprised students by reciting in English from the speech. But he also told students they only knew the words and not the essence of the American president's speech, and later criticized students for their `` superficial'' knowledge of the West. The source in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has limited understanding of Russian. According to official profiles, he reads Romanian, French and Japanese, and is fond of music and literature. He is said to be the son-in-law of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s former president and one of the Old Guard hard-liners who have supported senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in the suppression of dissent.

 Riot troopers backed by fire trucks raided a university campus before dawn Saturday and arrested 21 students accused of organizing violent anti-government protests, police said. Police said about 3,500 riot police searched two buildings at <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for student leaders. At least 21 students were arrested, but many more escaped before police arrived, police said. Police said hundreds of firebombs and clubs were seized.

Also Saturday, in the southern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, news reports said about 400 radical students armed with firebombs and steel bars attacked prosecutors' offices, burning two cars and injuring five policemen. The attackers briefly occupied the compound of a three-story building housing prosecutors' offices and fled after shattering windows of the building and 16 cars, the reports said. Police arrested three students. One student was seriously injured when he jumped off the top of the building, shouting slogans denouncing the government, said <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency.

<HEAD>Colombia Raises Gas Prices, Citing Pipeline Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government raised gasoline prices 10 percent Saturday and blamed the increase on Marxist guerrillas whose two-year sabotage campaign has cost the oil industry $ 375 million in lost export revenues. Union leaders said the move would increase inflation. One opposition politician said the government should halt terrorism, not raise prices. The increase boosted the average price of regular gasoline from 195 pesos -LRB- 52 cents -RRB- to 215 pesos -LRB- 57 cents -RRB- a gallon, and premium gas from 243 pesos -LRB- 65 cents -RRB- to 267 pesos -LRB- 75 cents -RRB-. The minimum wage is 32,000 pesos -LRB- $ 85 -RRB- a month. `` There was no other alternative left to avoid depriving the government of the resources needed to pay for social programs,'' Energy Minister <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> said in a nationwide television broadcast announcing the increase. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s rich eastern oil fields are jointly operated by the state-owned conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 50 percent of the shares, and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, which control 25 percent each. Since the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began their sabotage campaign, the oil industry has reported 104 terrorist attacks. The guerrillas want the government to nationalize the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and have said the attacks on oil pipelines will continue until the government allows a public debate on nationalization. Earlier this week, Comptroller General <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he favored a dialogue with the guerrillas that would include ways of improving the revenues <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> receives from its partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> estimated export revenue losses at $ 375 million since the guerrilla attacks began two years ago, just as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> began exporting oil. The latest and most devastating dynamite attack knocked out the pump station at <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION> port on June 16, halting daily exports of 200,000 barrels. Repairs are not expected to be completed until at least mid-July. Most of the guerrilla attacks have occurred on the 487-mile pipeline between oil fields in <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> border, and <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION> port. About 420,000 barrels of oil have spilled over the mountainous region since the guerrilla attacks began, according to <LOCATION> Mejia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>. Several union leaders said Saturday the increase in gasoline prices will worsen inflation, already running at an annual rate of 13.6 percent. Another critic was <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Impotent before terrorism, the government has decided to pass on to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> people the cost of this madness,'' he said.

 At age 81 she may have thought she had seen everything, but <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Granzeau </PERSON> ran into something new when she encountered a squirrel swimming in her toilet. The animal apparently ended a fall down a plumbing vent Friday by swimming through a waste pipe and bobbing up in the toilet bowl about the same time Mrs. <PERSON> Granzeau </PERSON> was stirring from a night's sleep. `` I screamed and ran out and shut the door,'' she said. `` I had hysterics.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Saturday offered to mediate a political solution to the civil war in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a guerrilla leader said. After a 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, guerrilla leader <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the provisional government established by the insurgents will vote on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s offer. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> is foreign minister of the government, which the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas plan to install in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if they oust the Marxist government. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> later told <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have discussed with all the parties to this conflict our own initiative.'' He did not elaborate. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> supported a neutral government made up of technocrats and independent of the communists or the Moslem insurgents. In the past, guerrilla leaders have rejected the neutral government proposal. But the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razzaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON>, said: `` It is very important that they change their views.'' The guerrillas began fighting in 1978 after the communists took over in a coup. Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> a year later to bolster the communist government and stayed for nine years. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> completed the withdrawal of its troops in February. `` The Soviets are gone,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Elhih </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` The reason to fight is over.'' However, the guerrillas, who have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, say the war will continue until they oust the Afghan government. They have refused to negotiate with President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a release issued late Saturday by the guerrilla-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> the Soviets should stop supporting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and sending weapons to his forces. `` I also told him that the mujahedeen do not accept the idea of sharing power with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Elhih </PERSON> said the insurgents should relent. `` Why not talk to your enemies? If you have courage to fight, you should have courage to talk,'' he said. He said both sides had approached <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> about mediating and that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader met earlier with representatives of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and the guerrillas. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who was welcomed at the airport by Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, previously visited <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in March. Then, he laid the cornerstone for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and met with guerrilla leaders. Guerrilla sources said at the time that the meeting accomplished little. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> urged the insurgents to push for a political solution to the war instead of a military one. The guerrillas rejected the idea. During this Pakistani visit, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also discussed the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, telling the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> it will end only after Israeli troops withdraw. He called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to press for an international peace conference, with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a full partner in negotiations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected such a proposal. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said following <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech, `` It is clearly not the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people who want to see the conflict continue, but it is those who do not believe in freedom and peace, who have used arms to terrorize.'' A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> made a `` personal'' donation of $ 50,000 to the uprising in April.

<TEXT>
 The damaged tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was towed Saturday through the often stormy Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but there was no sign of stress at critical points and no significant dribbling of residual oil near the ship. The 897-foot tanker ran aground three months ago on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, ripping large gashes in its hull and releasing nearly 11 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, causing the nation's worst oil spill. The vessel was refloated two weeks after the accident and towed 25 miles to an already soiled anchorage near <LOCATION> Naked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. There, divers and salvage crews made it seaworthy for the 2,500-mile trip to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> shipyard where it is scheduled for $ 25 million in repairs. Two ocean-going tugs began towing the huge tanker out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> waters early Friday. The procession was halted about four hours Friday night for a final <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inspection before leaving the Hinchinbrook Entrance and proceeding into open water, officials said. `` The strain gauges aboard the vessel showed no stress,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, an Exxon spokesman in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, said Saturday. `` There was no trace of oil on or near the boat.'' Observers who earlier had watched the procession lift anchor under gray and gloomy skies reported a light film of oil trailing the virtually empty tanker. But the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> released a statement prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> that generally discounted the seriousness of those observations. A light sheen was observed coming off the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> `` for a few minutes after the ship's departure,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>, who quoted from the statement. It was believed that most of that sheen was a `` bio-mass,'' microorganisms or algae, `` plus an insignificant'' amount of oil that washed out of the open tanks during turbulence as the vessel got under way, the statement said. The sheen was very thin _ too thin for skimmer boats to pick up, officials said. Some of it was recovered by absorbant pads, officials said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has said this was not considered serious and not unexpected,'' <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> read. `` All discharge has stopped,'' she said. `` There has been none since the initial startup.'' The vessels have been moving at about 6 knots and were to slow to an average speed of 5 knots as they continue toward <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, officials said.

 A tiny rotating blade device was inserted surgically and used to slice away plaque to unclog a patient's heart artery in a first-of-its-kind procedure, a doctor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. Cardiologist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfson </PERSON>, 58, was the first patient in medical history to undergo an atherectomy, in which an experimental blade device is used to clear plaque from a blocked heart artery. <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said he inserted the tiny blade device, which was attached to a long tube, into an artery in the patient's leg and maneuvered it carefully to the heart. The rotating blade sliced away the plaque, which was then sucked out of the artery by a vacuum attached to the device. The procedure successfully restored blood flow to <PERSON> Alfson </PERSON>'s heart, <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The hope is that if you actually remove the plaque from the artery, it wo n't narrow down again,'' <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alfson </PERSON> said he had bypass surgery 10 years ago and a vein from his leg was grafted to the heart.

 Last year, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was ablaze with wars in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> that all seemed to defy a solution. Today, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is on the road to independence, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has a cease-fire, and there are moves afoot to begin peace talks in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Each conflict has been fueled by separate forces, but a common ingredient for the improved regional climate has been <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s campaign to mend relations with its long-hostile neighbors in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Since August, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has: _ Withdrawn its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they fought intermittently since 1975 alongside the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> The rebels and the Marxist Angolan government reached a cease-fire agreement last week that took effect Saturday. _ Begun implementing a U.N.-supervised independence plan in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the territory <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years _ Held a series of top-level meetings with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and offered financial assistance to help repair the country's war-devastated economy Black-ruled nations remain skeptical of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, saying the country's policy of apartheid at home and its destabilization campaign abroad caused the regional turmoil. But there has been a sharp reversal in the political tides since the middle of 1988, when conflicts dating to the 1960s and 1970s appeared ready to escalate again. `` Those who were part of the problem yesterday are now part of the solution,'' Mozambican President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said Friday night after returning from an <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> summit in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, where the Angolan cease-fire was announced. `` To make myself clear, I do n't think the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> will go back on their word'' in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the national news agency AIM. In May 1988, the heaviest fighting in the Angolan war was reported around the southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale. Angolan government troops, backed by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers, fought the combined UNITA-South African forces to an apparent standoff. The Cuban troop strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> had surpassed 50,000 and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> acknowledged 3,000 soldiers more-or-less based in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Faced with an expensive, open-ended conflict and mounting white casualties, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> apparently decided to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Peace talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ but not <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ began in late May 1988. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> completed its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in August. In December, the three countries signed a regional peace accord that called for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to halt aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. In return, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has agreed to a phased troop withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, continued to fight for a power-sharing agreement until the cease-fire was announced. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> called the agreement `` a great moment for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The rival Angolan parties still face difficult negotiations, but a commission elected at the summit plans to oversee the integration of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> into the current one-party state. In <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a 23-year bush war waged by the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule appears over. An estimated 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters celebrated the accord on Saturday with a rally, and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders said that `` we must now wage peace.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> announced Saturday it was down to 1,500 troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a week ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> deadline under the territory's independence plan <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had an estimated 50,000 soliders in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> before the independence plan took effect April 1. The independence plan almost fell apart the day it began when more than 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas crossed into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in violation of the regional peace agreement. More than 300 guerrillas and 27 security-force members were killed, but the fighting has stopped and pre-independence elections are planned for November. Independence is expected to come early next year. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s harshest critics in the past, said black African states would consider strengthening ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if Namibian independence goes smoothly. With tangible successes in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, southern African leaders have turned their sights toward the region's most active conflict, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where the Marxist government has fought the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> since 1977. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, whose troops support Mozambican government forces, said the plan to end the Angolan war could have parallels for <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Although the two wars differ in some ways, `` the -LRB- Angolan peace talk -RRB- principles deserve the attention of the Mozambicans,'' he was quoted as saying Friday by <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZIANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` I am sure something will unfold soon.'' <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said he hoped the Angolan agreement would encourage the rebels to take up an amnesty offer in effect since January 1988. More than 3,000 rebels, out of a force estimated at 12,000 to 22,000, already have accepted the offer, according to government figures. On Saturday, <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> had agreed to act as a mediator between the government and the guerrillas, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> has refused to negotiate with the rebels, but his government has quietly encouraged unpublicized talks between local church leaders and the rebels, according to sources in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Cuba Arrests Appear Linked to Miami Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The arrest of high-ranking military officers inside <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> appear to be linked to a recent drug case here, a federal prosecutor said. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering lodging a formal request with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to interview Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, one of the officers charged in that country, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and 10 other officers and government officials worked with the Colombia-based <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> drug cartel, taking money from traffickers to allow them to use the island as a way station for smuggling into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors say the names of some of the officers now in custody in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> surfaced in a 1987 probe of a smuggling ring that culminated in two indictments and a 1988 trial. `` It is clear that these -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> -RRB- arrests are substantially connected to information generated at this trial,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. He refused to identify the officers. One of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> cases involved <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON>, a Venezuelan, who was convicted on a 10-count indictment last year that accused him of bringing cocaine through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. In March, <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> and three others pleaded guilty to a related 27-count indictment. They are awaiting sentencing. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> allegedly headed a Caribbean-based smuggling ring that involved Cuban military officials. The only <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> official publicly named in the <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> case was `` Fidel'' _ an apparent reference to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ who <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, on a secretly recorded videotape, claimed was pocketing bribes from smugglers to use <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> territory. `` The money went right in <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON>'s drawer,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> boasted to an undercover agent on the tape. He also said he landed at military airports and had drug-laden boats escorted through Cuban waters by military torpedo boats. The information revealed by <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>'s guilty plea may have had reprecussions inside <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` That information was quite good, and probably embarrassed the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` They have arrested some of the people identified in that case.'' During the investigation, an undercover agent flew into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Varadero </LOCATION> air base escorted by Cuban MiG's, and used <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military frequencies, according to federal authorities The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering a request to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators to question <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>.

<HEAD>EDS: New throut to UPDATE with leadership revamping Poliburo, other

<TEXT>
 The communist leadership chose prominent reformer <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> as party chairman on Saturday and appointed him to a new four-man ruling body that is dominated by advocates of democratic change. The action by the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> erodes the power of party General Secretary <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who sought a middle ground between hard-liners and reformers. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> created a four-member Presidium comprised of Nyers, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and two other prominent reformers _ Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, spokesman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said in a statement relayed on radio, television and the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. The four will lead the party on a provisional basis until a crucial party <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set for Oct. 7, when communists will choose who will lead the party as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> prepares for its first free and competitive elections next year. The choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to the party's attempts to hold power when the elections are held. The promotion of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> to the largely symbolic party chairmanship _ and the inclusion of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> in the Presidium _ indicate reformers won a protracted internal battle with conservative communists. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, an economist, inherits the chairmanship from <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who was named honorary party chairman when <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> took over as general secretary just 13 months ago. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 77, leader of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s communists for 32 years, was stripped of the chairmanship last month <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has lost standing recently as the split between reformers and hard-liners left him little middle ground. Several party reform groups called publicly for his ouster. But only four of the 92 speakers at the closed-door <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session demanded <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> step down, Major said, and he retained his title of general secretary. His inclusion in the new leadership suggested the reformers had been forced to compromise with disgruntled conservatives who are still powerful in the party. The first act of the new leadership late Saturday was to revamp the nine-man party Politburo, expanding its membership to 21 and renaming it the Political Executive Committee, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. The makeup of the new Politburo also struck a balance between reformers and conservatives, including all nine members of the old body along with important reformers such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. Reformers showed their strength in achieving the ouster of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, a former chief ideologist who lost his Politburo seat in April, from the influential rank of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> will head a new party ideological institute, <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said. Saturday's changes seemed designed to prevent an open party split before the Oct. 7 party congress. The reformers believe that only the communists' most democratic policies give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in next year's elections. A split now could ruin the party's chances at the polls against opposition groups. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> also is trying to boost its image in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as a stable economic partner before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visits next month. The communists are negotiating a timetable and regulations for the elections with the opposition and promised last week that the opposition would be able to review proposed election laws before they are considered by the communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was also named to head the party's delegation to the talks. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and two moderates make up the rest of the delegation, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. The promotion of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, 66, seals a stunning comeback in East bloc politics. After pioneering economic reforms in the late 1960s, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing too hard for more changes. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> made it back to the Politburo when <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> took over in May 1988 at the head of a revamped leadership that also gave <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> a Politburo seat. It was not immediately clear how much power <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> will have as party chairman. He told the independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> on Friday that he would not want to be a mere `` symbolic figure'' if given the post.

 A man who swallowed about $ 1 million worth of heroin in at least 74 packages was detained at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Intercontinental Airport after agreeing to be X-rayed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials said. <PERSON> Enemuo </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> passed from his digestive tract more than 1 -LCB- pounds of heroin in the balloon-like packages, <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON>, chief customs inspector at the airport, said Friday. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON> was X-rayed, said Saturday he had been released to federal authorites. <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON> is charged with possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, which carries a maximum punishment of life in prison and a $ 4 million fine. Federal prosecutors will ask a judge at a hearing Monday to detain <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON> without bond, said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON> was stopped by customs agents because he appeared nervous and was coming from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, a country that is an established source of illegal drugs, Vice said. Two other Nigerian men arrested under similar circumstances in the last week of May had even more balloon-like heroin packages in their bodies. But <PERSON> Akwali </PERSON> was carrying a significantly larger amount of the drug, Vice said. Officials said they do not know if the `` swallowers,'' as Vice called them, are part of the same drug ring.

 Hundreds of people lined the shore on Saturday, clutching binoculars to see if their fears of an environmental disaster in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> had been realized. What they saw _ a wounded oil tanker barely a mile offshore, listing and ringed with <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats _ left many with feelings of resignation or anger. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> sat on a lonely rock outcrop, alternately staring at the World Prodigy, which leaked more than 1 million gallons of heating fuel when it struck a reef Friday, and scanning the water, hoping not to see any of the fuel washing ashore. `` I'm pretty devastated myself, because if something hurts the earth, it hurts me, too. I worried about the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> one, too, but this is right on our doorstep,'' she said. At a nearby state park, spectators were lined along the road by 5 a.m., watching the process of unloading the tanker's remaining oil. `` If the oil comes in on our beaches, there goes the beaches,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Her husband, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who said he could remember three or four tankers running aground during the past 50 years, was resigned to it, `` as long as you're going to have an economy.'' `` But that's a little close,'' his wife said, pointing to the ship. Word that the Greek captain had failed to pick up a harbor pilot before navigating the treacherous entrance to <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> sparked some anger. `` Guys like that ought to hang. I have no mercy for people like that,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. The ship was not inland far enough to require a pilot, but some officials said it was unwise of the captain to operate without one. `` It's kind of a gray area out there,'' said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> marine safety investigator. `` When the Valdez happened, I said to myself it's a wonder it does n't happen around here with all the traffic that comes up and down the bay,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` But it's probably going to happen again some day with this coastline the way it is and the amount of traffic. ... `` I think they learned a lot from the Valdez that it's not wise to sit around and wait for the company to clean it up.'' `` The water is literally orange in some places where the waves are breaking,'' said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay.

 A major offshore oil spill forced beaches to close but failed to keep determined tourists away from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>'s famous mansions, restaurants, and even its oil-besmirched harbor on Saturday While officials were busy trying to reduce the potential of an oil spill of up to 1.5 million gallons, visitors shopped, went out in tour boats and waited in line at restaurants. `` It's like it never happened,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people are just walking around shopping, they have their maps, they have their brochures. It's a typical day,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and Visitors' Bureau. As many as 20,000 sunbathers were left stranded when the state closed beaches in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION>, but the dedicated found other amusements to pass the time. Despite a request by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> that boaters stay off the water, the Salem Pro Sail Series continued as scheduled with only a slight delay. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> DEM </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency response team, had said `` We do n't want boats churning up the oil slick.'' Nevertheless, harbor tours continued to run. `` Today seems to be a business as usual day,'' said <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. `` A lot of people do n't even know -LRB- the spill -RRB- is around here,'' he said. `` They're on vacation, either they've been out all morning and have n't listened to the news, have n't picked up a paper, or maybe they are n't as concerned about this as we would like to think they are.'' Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said he thought the effects of the spill on tourism would be temporary. `` By and large it should not affect tourism,'' he said. The Marriott and the <LOCATION> Sheraton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islander </LOCATION>, both located in downtown <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, were fully booked, manangers said. A noxious smell that had permeated the area late Friday had lessened, they said. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON>, night manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, said the odor had been so foul it woke him up Friday evening. At the Inn at <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, the site where the World Prodigy struck a rock Friday afternoon, visitors were lined up to get into the dining room, said a reservation agent who would not give her name. `` Our dining room is booked full to capacity. We are turning people away,'' she said, adding that such heavy business was normal this time of year. The slick was not visible from the dining room, she said. On Friday, some <PERSON> Newporters </PERSON> had expressed concern the five-mile slick would impact on the <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative tourist industry. Tourists spent about $ 1.1 billion in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in 1987, a 15 percent increase over 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, tourism is the largest industry. `` No one's going to want to come down here,'' said <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagenbach </PERSON>, 18, a waitress at the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pearl </ORGANIZATION>, a popular oceanfront restaurant in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. `` I think it's going to affect the whole summer, depending on how big it is.'' She said business was slower than usual Friday night. But <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said visitors were just choosing other options. A group of scuba divers were a little disturbed they could n't go, but then cheered up when they decided to tour the mansions instead. The coastal road near the spill and <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the seaside street dotted with castle-like mansions, were rerouted to one-way traffic, but <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said it was flowing without problem. The traffic was changed in an attempt to deter curious onlookers, who had caused traffic jams Friday as they drove by the spill, said <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>.

 Hundreds of Moslem demonstrators carrying placards and shouting slogans marched through the capital Saturday in a second day of protest against slippers that reputedly blaspheme Islam, police said. The government banned the sale of the slippers and seized unsold stocks on Friday, the same day angry Moslems attacked shops owned by the manufacturer, the Canadian-based Beta Shoe Co. Some Moslems consider the rubber slippers offensive to Islam because they bear a logo resembling the Arabic characters for Allah. Clashes with police Friday in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mymensigh </PERSON>, a town 70 miles to the north, left at least 30 people injured, police said on condition of anonymity. On Saturday, riot police guarded the 10 shops owned by Beta and about 2,000 protesters called for a worldwide boycott of the Canadian company. Riot police were stationed at strategic points of the city but no clashes were reported. Islam is the state religion of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, and 90 percent of the country's 110 million people are Moslem.

<TEXT>
 The nation's only law requiring AIDS testing for a marriage license needs only Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s signature to be off the books The Legislature sent a repeal measure to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s desk on a 33-23 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote late Friday. A spokesman for <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the governor had not decided whether to sign the bill, which was approved in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month on a 65-48 vote. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor, said that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the only other state to have adopted such a law, already had repealed its statute. He also noted that such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> were opposed to the testing requirement. `` This is a low-risk population,'' <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON> said, referring to couples applying for marriage licenses. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said that through mid-June, 44 people had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS-causing virus out of an estimated 221,000 marriage-license applicants who have been tested since the requirement started in January 1988. `` This is not good public health policy,'' <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON> said. `` The key to this disease is education, getting people to come in voluntarily and be tested.'' `` There's nothing in the law, should we pass this bill, that will bar someone from having an AIDS test,'' he said. Critics countered that the premarital tests help monitor the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and reduce the chance of children getting the disease even though those testing positive for the AIDS virus can still marry. `` That child is an innocent and we have a right to protect the children,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Geo-Karis </PERSON>. `` You eliminate the testing program, you eliminate public awareness,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. `` I think we ought to keep the test going. Frankly, I hope it never shows up a lot of positives.'' The measure would also repeal the requirement that couples be tested for syphilis before getting married. A study by public health officials estimated that the cost that engaged couples had to pay for testing and associated doctors' visits was about $ 2.5 million over six months last year, or $ 312,000 for each of the eight cases of infection identified during that period The authors of the study also noted that the state was losing thousands of dollars in revenue becauses <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> couples were traveling to neighboring states to get married to avoid paying for the AIDS tests.

 A black <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> priest who announced plans to form a separate black Catholic church said Saturday he has been forbidden to celebrate Mass or other church rites. Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said he also was fired from his job as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archdiocesan evangelist. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said the notice was contained in letters from Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> told him, `` I must urge you in the strongest possible terms to turn away from this fatal course.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said he expected harsh criticism from <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> and other church officials, because the move represents a schism with the organized Roman Catholic diocese. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s letters labeled the move `` a significant step toward separating yourself from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> has not received any communication directly from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, said an associate who asked not to be identified. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said, however, he was surprised by the wording of <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s letters. `` This is strong language,'' he said. `` It is not the language of a man who claims to be the personal representative of the Pope ... and the representative of Christ.'' Charging the church with ignoring the `` spiritual and cultural needs'' of black parishioners, <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> last week announced plans to form a new black congregation. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said Saturday he still plans to hold the first services of the new church July 2. `` We will consider it a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> service,'' he said. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> also said he plans to hire a bodyguard although he has received no specific threat. `` I have no other choice but to think my life is in jeopardy,'' he said.

 Israeli authorities claimed Saturday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relief worker kidnapped in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> cooperated with his captors, and a news report said officials were considering taking action against him. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 35, co-director of the Save the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, was freed Friday about 30 hours after he was seized by gunmen. He strongly criticized his captors. Repeated phone calls to <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s home and office went unanswered Saturday. A close associate of <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s at Save the Children, who requested anonymity, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> was away for the weekend and unavailable for comment on the Israeli claims. The associate said the government allegations and news organizations' requests for comment had been relayed to <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who was `` aware that a statement is expected from him.'' Reports that <PERSON> George </PERSON> was being investigated were broadcast throughout the day on government-run radio. `` It is clear that <PERSON> George </PERSON> did not stage the kidnapping itself, but he apparently cooperated with the abductors from the moment he was taken,'' a senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said <PERSON> George </PERSON> named one of his abductors but declined to provide descriptions of the two others. <PERSON> George </PERSON> told reporters after his release that he knew only one of his captors. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television's Arabic-language broadcast said security authorities were considering taking unspecified `` measures'' against <PERSON> George </PERSON>, whom the radio described as being `` hostile toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefkow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he was unaware of the investigation and added: `` This would be an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> matter, a matter for the Israeli government.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said he was lured outside his organization's <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> field office by three Palestinian gunmen and taken away in a car. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who spoke to reporters outside his home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> after his release Friday, denounced the kidnapping as `` not only immoral but also a criminal act.'' He said the kidnappers told him he was taken because he was `` a well-known and important American,'' and kept him locked in a room during the kidnapping, but did not abuse him. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, whose group works with Palestinian refugees, identified one of his kidnappers as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasr </PERSON>. `` He has come to the office for the last two years. He wanted help in building a playground in the Jabaliya -LRB- refugee -RRB- camp and we have considered the project. But the work that he had done on the playground was stopped by the Israeli authorities so the project did not get anywhere,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. An Israeli army statement blamed the kidnapping on `` terrorists linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> denied it was involved and had urged his release. Israeli security officials claimed <PERSON> George </PERSON> cooperated with his captors' efforts to seek the release of jailed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said earlier his captors were demanding that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> release seven senior <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. Before releasing <PERSON> George </PERSON>, the abductors gave him a 13-page letter saying they carried out the abduction to draw world attention to the plight of the Palestinian people and urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. It was signed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasr </PERSON>, described as a 39-year-old Palestinian who was released from an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jail in 1985 in a prisoner swap. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, Palestinians said he is not known to be affiliated with any political faction. Israeli television, in a report Saturday night, quoted security officials as saying they were checking the possibility <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` assisted his abductors in presenting their demands and even expressed identification with their stand.''

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> says he will continue his efforts to end a 2 -LCB- - month-old strike of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, despite the company's decision to reject his offer to help <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> on Friday offered to mediate negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> declined, saying federal mediators would be better suited to handle negotiations. Federal mediators had been meeting with both sides before the union dropped out of the talks on June 7. `` I'm deeply disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to accept our offer to assist in seeking a solution to the coal strike,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said in a statement issued late Friday. `` But I am not ready to discontinue my efforts to end the conflict between <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and the Unite Mine Workers. It has too far-reaching an effect on too many families and communities for me to give up.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> had agreed to the meeting before <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> turned down the offer. Union miners went on strike at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on April 5. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> also began a strike at the company's <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> holdings. At issue are wages and benefits the 1,900 striking miners contend are unfair. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is one of the relatively few mining companies that does not currently have a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contract. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s offer also was aimed at ending wildcat walkouts by 44,000 miners in 10 states, at companies that do have <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contracts. Those strikes, which the union says it has not sanctioned, have spurred sporadic incidents of violence though the situation Saturday was generally calm. Many mining companies shut down for two weeks in the summer as part of their contract with workers. One vacation period began Saturday morning and ends July 9. Two other vacation periods are to follow. Companies chose one of the three periods. Vacation shutdowns mean wildcat strikers will get a break, since `` there wo n't be anyone working at the mines to picket,'' said District 17 field representative <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has staggered vacations, so its mines continue running, he said. The estimated number of miners involved in wildcat strikes, according to union and industry officials, are: <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 16,000; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 8,500; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 6,900; <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, 5,000; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 2,560; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 2,325; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 1,750; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 755; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 350; and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, 200.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and cleanup crews battled strong wind and rough water Saturday to survey and try to contain a 250,000-gallon oil spill from a barge ruptured in a collision in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. The winds of more than 15 mph with higher gusts prevented workers from surrounding the barge with containment booms until late morning, Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said the Panamanian-registered motor vessel Rachel-B collided around 6:20 p.m. Friday with one of three barges being driven by a tugboat owned by Coastal Towing. Investigators have not determined who was at fault for the accident. The collision ruptured and emptied three of 12 tanks on one of the barges, and each tank was holding about 2,000 barrels or 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The first major oil spill in eight years in the ship channel came just a few hours after 1 million gallons of heating oil spilled from a tanker off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. After the remaining oil was pumped out of the damaged barge and it was towed away Saturday, authorities reopened eight miles of the channel they had closed from the area where it begins running inland to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> from upper <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The 40-foot-deep channel continues through the bay southeast to <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The accident occurred in the bay where the ship channel intersects with the <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, as the tug headed inland and the other vessel, a tanker whose cargo was not determined, headed outbound, officials said. The tug operator, fearing a worse spill if the barge overturned, maneuvered it after the accident out of the deep channel until it was grounded in shallow water, official said. When the weather finally allowed a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter flight late Saturday morning, the aerial look showed the slick stretching two miles to the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> shoreline between Red Bluff and the <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. It was nearly continuous and about a mile wide at its widest point, he said. The barge owner hired a contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Garner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION>, to contain and clean up the spill, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Workers laid booms around the barge and also to direct the flow of the spill away from shore and into the <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>. `` It looks pretty good at this point. If we can get it contained within <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, it should be fairly easy to clean up,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Some of the slick is already being driven into that area by the winds and rains, so they're just trying to funnel it all in.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said there had been no reports of damage to fish and wildlife. `` Fortunately this is an area of the bay where there are not many environmentally sensitive areas,'' he said, adding that the flow of the spill apparently did not endanger shrimp grounds or oyster beds in the bay. The last major spill in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> occurred in 1981 when the Olympic Gloria dumped about 7,000 barrels of oil after a collision with a tanker.

 Ribbons of heating oil drifted at least 20 miles and washed onto <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shores Saturday from a tanker that grounded in one of three accidents that together spilled as much as 3.35 million gallons of oil. In the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, a Uruguayan oil tanker carrying 28 million gallons of industrial heating oil ran aground Saturday morning, and its crew reported the spill as 1.6 million gallons. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there was no way to know exactly how much spilled because a significant amount of oil may have sunk. `` We are going to go with that because we want to be ready to respond to a worst-case scenario.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 250,000 gallons of heavy crude oil spilled from a tug-driven barge damaged in a collision with a cargo vessel Friday evening. The <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> accident spilled 1 million to 1.5 million gallons of fuel, authorities said. Together, the accidents were the worst setback for the oil shipping industry since nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil gushed into Alaskan waters from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, causing the nation's worst oil spill. As workers began the delicate task of unloading the damaged tanker at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, officials closed beaches and shellfishing beds and promised a criminal investigation. `` I'm real angry,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, who called out <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardsmen </LOCATION> and prison inmates to help with the cleanup. `` This amounts to gross negligence, no question about it.'' He said the Greek tanker's captain admitted making a mistake in plotting the 530-foot ship's course before hitting well-marked <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on Friday afternoon. The fuel that leaked from the tanker World Prodigy off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>'s southern tip ranged from a light film to a thicker coating that turned the surf orange The oil, which spread primarily north and west, formed `` ribbons ... here and there'' that were difficult to track and contain, said Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Providence marine safety office. Some had been found in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, an inlet about 20 miles north along <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The oil washed onto a sandy beach at <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and rocky shores south of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, across from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the environmental group Save the Bay. Authorities closed several beaches along the bay and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> coasts and banned shellfishing, fishing and swimming in the bay because the light oil was potentially toxic, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Cleanup crews strung absorbent booms at sensitive coves and inlets, extending a containment effort that began Friday when booms were dropped around the ship. The light, refined oil dispersed rapidly, which hastened evaporation but meant `` more booms, more people; it's a logistical nightmare,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbors </ORGANIZATION>, a cleanup company. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> called out 200 <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardsmen </LOCATION> and 120 state prison inmates to help. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, part of a team sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to tour the area and assess the spill's impact, said, `` technology is just not up to the job.'' `` It could have been a lot worse than it was,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview upon his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It was a big spill. But I'm very pleased overall. We do learn things. And what we learned from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill was that a quick response is the best response. `` Things are very much under control now,'' he said. `` We've got it contained. The ship's not leaking anymore.'' Crews began unloading onto barges the estimated 5.5 million gallons of oil still on board the World Prodigy. Pumping raised the ship's bow from about 18 inches above the water to 8 or 9 feet, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Workers hoped to have the oil pumped out of the tanker in three days, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` It's a very delicate balance right now. You do n't know what other internal damage has been done to the tanks,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedenbender </PERSON>, an off-loading specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, said his office was preparing search warrants for the ship, which was under federal control, and would start a grand jury investigation Monday. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said lawsuits were more likely than criminal charges. `` The result may have been criminal but the evidence that is there would point toward civil'' action, he said. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the most immediate problem was that the oil has sunk. `` We believe that there's a significant amount of oil that is below the surface. This is so close to the weight of water that it may travel several miles before it surfaces. `` There's just no possible way to contain that oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said clean-up crews on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> will have to track the oil's path as best they can and attack it when it surfaces. Containment booms were placed along creeks, tributaries and bird sanctuaries around the spill in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Officials expressed relief that the oil was refined and therefore not as toxic as it could be. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> also toured the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> spill at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request. `` That was supposed to be as big as the one in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. We flew over the whole river by helicopter, but it did n't seem that extensive,'' he said. `` There is a lot of speculation that perhaps it is not even 200,000 gallons. It's not a terrible one.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the response to the Friday night spill in the upper portion of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> was hampered by high winds and seas spawned by numerous thunderstorms, officials said. But Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the choppy conditions spawned by a tropical depression in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were actually helping the cleanup efforts by Saturday afternoon. Coast Guard officials got their first aerial view of the mile-wide spill late Saturday morning when winds receded enough to allow helicopter travel. Gusty winds and choppy water returned later in the day. Workers constructed a boom around the mouth of <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> in an effort to capture most of the slick, which stretched two miles to the shoreline, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said.

 Exiled musicians from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a Zulu choir and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> brought thousands of Soviets to their feet for two hours Saturday as <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Graceland'' tour opened in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some 5,000 people, including many foreigners, gathered on a warm evening in Gorky Park for the concert. The musicians included the 10-man Zulu choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and South African exiles <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON>, a singer, and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Masekela </PERSON>, a trumpeter. It was the first Soviet appearance by the 47-year-old <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency indicated it was the first time black South African musicians have performed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> do not have diplomatic relations. For the $ 9 admission price, spectators were treated to the hymn-like a cappella harmonies of the Zulu choir, <PERSON> Masekela </PERSON>'s ballad about trains bringing blacks to work in South African mines, and songs by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who sang works ranging from `` Graceland'' to `` The Sound of Silence.'' By Western standards Soviet audiences are usually sedate, but when <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> took the stage hundreds of spectators crowded before him to dance and sing. Thousands more stood on benches, clapping and tapping their feet to the beat.

 <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> woke his band up early Saturday, even though they had played a late show the night before to help kick off this year's JVC Jazz Festival. <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> had an important piece of business to take care of Saturday afternoon. He was passing on the tradition. In a delightful program called `` Cooling It With Snoopy,'' <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> used his trumpet to entertain a theater full of children, giving both the kids and their parents plenty to enjoy. <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> has won wide acclaim for his jazz recordings and performances. He has carved out a second career as a classical artist. All the time he has maintained yet another career, less celebrated but perhaps likely to have as much or more impact as his performances. That's <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> the teacher. He devotes much of his time to clinics for student musicians at all levels. Saturday he looked out at an audience whose members were mostly too young to have begun music lessons. His job was to give them the bug _ get them interested. Snoopy paraded down the center aisle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Town Hall theater as <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>, members of his regular group and a few friends played the familiar theme from the Peanuts television specials. Then <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> explained to Snoopy how a jazz band was put together. The bass walks. `` The drums in a jazz band are like the motor in a car,'' he said. `` It gives it the energy, the drive.'' The saxophone, trumpet, trombone and clarinet can be mournful, happy, wild and restrained, <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> explained _ and the musicians demonstrated. <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> had the audience counting the four beats in a jazz shuffle, the three beats of a waltz and the 12 measures in the blues. One of the highlights was the performance of 13-year-old <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> <PERSON> A.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> on alto sax and 12-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON>'s brother, on drums `` I want you to hear how kids play jazz,'' <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> said. In the case of these two, kids play jazz amazingly well. Judging by the audience's reaction to <LOCATION> Marsalis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Snoopy </PERSON> and host <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>, director of cultural affairs programming at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, the concert was a whopping success.

 Rock-throwing youths battled with police Saturday after rallies by a minority workers' group and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Two officers were injured and 79 demonstrators were arrested, authorities said. Police, anticipating clashes between the groups, deployed more than 700 officers and the government banned marches that were to have followed the rallies that drew a total of about 400 people. Police ringed the rally sites of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a local organization of workers from the Indian and Pakistani community in this city 180 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Mounted officers, dog handlers and riot squads carrying shields and wearing helmets stood by. The clashes occurred after the rallies when police moved in to clear the town center of demonstrators. A police statement reported no fights between the groups but that youths broke windows and severely vandalized a pub. Police estimated 250 people attended the workers' rally. The British <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supporters, estimated by police at 150, held a half-hour meeting and most left town in buses. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is a small, white neo-Nazi organization.

 Israeli soldiers raided villages in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Saturday to arrest suspected participants in the Palestinian uprising and wounded at least six Arabs, according to the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. They also said a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was killed at a detention center in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Israeli authorities said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relief worker, kidnapped in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and released Friday after being held for 30 hours, apparently cooperated with his Palestinian captors. Israeli radio described the victim, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 35, as `` hostile toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> television said security authorities were considering taking unspecified measure against him. The army said `` many suspects'' were arrested in the raids on several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages. Arab reporters said that four women ages 19 to 46 were shot and wounded in the arms and legs during a raid on the village of <LOCATION> Jaba </LOCATION>. They said women rushed to the streets and protested when soldiers ordered males ages 12 to 45 to the village school's courtyard. Troops then beat some of the men, the reporters said. An army spokesman said soldiers encountered `` a violent resistance by <PERSON> Jaba </PERSON> residents'' and wounded three Palestinians in clashes. The army command confirmed a total of six wounded in the raids. Arab hospital officials said at least seven were wounded. At the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention center in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 23-year-old Palestinian carried the body of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadalla </PERSON> out of a tent, threw it in front of a guard and said he strangled <PERSON> Jadalla </PERSON> because the man collaborated with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. Palestinian reporters said the 22-year-old detainee was beaten and strangled. At least 65 suspected collaborators are among the 531 Palestinians killed in the 18 -LCB- - month uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands Twenty-three Israelis also have died. Palestinians in the territories heeded calls from the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement and staged a general strike on Saturday to protest the desecration of the Holy Koran by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. A soldier recently used pages of a Koran as toilet paper. He later said he could not read Arabic and apologized publicly.

 The military announced Saturday it will shoot down private planes violating Cuban air space on grounds they probably are engaged in drug smuggling. An armed forces announcement also said a military honor tribunal was scheduled to convene Sunday in the case of Division Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a decorated combat veteran accused of having links with a Colombian cocaine cartel. Both announcements were published in <LOCATION> Granma </LOCATION>, the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this week <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> published a lengthy report of a drug scandal that led to the arrests of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a brigadier general, two colonels, a lieutenant colonel, a captain and a major. The report on aircraft said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been hospitable to <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> air traffic but it now must act to stop drug-smuggling planes from using its airspace. `` Private aircraft often violate Cuban airspace and refuse to land despite repeated warnings,'' the statement said. `` Such irregular flights ... can only be explained as drug trafficking activity. `` We will be obliged to shoot, however disagreeable it might be, at whatever aircraft ... refuses to obey orders to land for inspection,'' it added. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraton </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been granting overflight permission almost automatically to commercial and private planes. It also has allowed unauthorized flights to pass through its airspace for a variety of reasons, including weather and emergencies. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> will go before a 47-member military tribunal, accused of disgracing the nation by allegedly collaborating with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel in smuggling cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> He was arrested June 12. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> reported after his arrest that 10 other military officers and government officials were accused of accepting bribes from drug traffickers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors have said the names of some of the officers became known during an investigation in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> of a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> smuggling ring that led to two indictments and a trial in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1988. `` It is clear that these arrests -LRB- of the Cuban officers -RRB- are substantially connected to information generated at this trial,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He did not identify the other officers. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may ask <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for permission to interview <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the other defendants are accused of letting smugglers use military airports and of escorting drug-laden boats through Cuban waters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said an undercover agent in the 1987 investigation flew into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Varadero </LOCATION> air base escorted by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> MiGs and used Cuban military frequencies. <PERSON> Granma </PERSON> acknowledged on Thursday that President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> ordered the investigation that led to <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s arrest after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was being used as a transshipment point for cocaine. The scandal, the first public admission that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been touched by the drug trade, created an uproar in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. People mobbed news vendors Saturday buying copies of <LOCATION> Granma </LOCATION> before they could even reach the newsstands. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, is a veteran of the Cuban revolution and was a field commander in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988. He is one of only five officers to receive the medal of the Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>, in its report Saturday, portrayed him as a man obsessed with money and said, `` A true revolution will never permit impunity. We shall wash in an exemplary manner outrages like this one.'' <PERSON> Granma </PERSON> did not say if the military tribunal would meet in public session, but an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said `` it must be in a large place, because of the great interest this has generated.'' The newspaper said among the members of the honor tribunal are four division generals, 31 brigadier generals, a vice admiral and a rear admiral. The tribunal, to be headed by Division Gen. <PERSON> Ulises </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Toro </PERSON>, will make recommendations regarding <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government, <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> said. One of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> cases involved <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON>, a Venezuelan convicted on a 10-count indictment last year that accused him of bringing cocaine through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. In March, <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> and three others pleaded guilty to a related 27-count indictment and are awaiting sentencing. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> allegedly headed a Caribbean-based smuggling ring that involved Cuban military officials. The only <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> official publicly named in the <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> case was `` Fidel'' _ a possible reference to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ who <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, on a secretly recorded videotape, claimed was pocketing bribes from smugglers using Cuban territory. `` The money went right in <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON>'s drawer,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> boasted to an undercover agent on the tape. He also said he landed at military airports and had drug-smuggling boats escorted through Cuban waters by military torpedo boats.

Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, or city council, have accused the intelligence division of human rights violations and said it also should be disbanded. <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the division will be restructured but details have not been worked out. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, 47, is accused of having <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> slain, allegedly because of fear the columnist would report links to prominent drug traffickers. <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, in his column in the newspaper Excelsior and in books, exposed wrongdoing in high places and wrote about other politically sensitive subjects. His murder galvanized the Mexican press and it has pressed two successive federal administrations to solve the case.

 Two pieces of 18th century furniture brought $ 180,000 on Saturday as descendants auctioned the estate of Declaration of Independence signer <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` Oh, my gosh!'' exclaimed <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ready </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s great-great-great-great granddaughter, as a representative of the state made the winning bid of $ 100,000 for a maple highboy `` I did n't think they were going to bid for that.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> antique dealer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Marlborough </ORGANIZATION> won an apothecary chest used by <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 80,000. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s handwritten labels are still on the drawers. `` It was probably the best example of that kind of thing I've ever seen in my life,'' said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, who runs antique stores in <LOCATION> Marlborough </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> `` It's a fantastic piece of furniture.'' <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, an associate of auctioneer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, received some bids by telephone. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said the $ 100,000 bid for the highboy, a tall chest of drawers, was the most ever paid for such a piece. Winning bidders also had to pay an extra 10 percent of their bids for the auctioneer's commission. The extensive collection of letters, papers, clothing and furniture was auctioned under huge tents in a field adjacent to the 1774 <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> homestead. About 500 people attended. In addition to signing the Declaration, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> served as president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and later as its governor, as well as a judge. He signed the Articles of Confederation, by which the nation was governed before the Constitution, and played a role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s decisive ratification of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution in June 1788. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s papers included a 1743 copy book from his school days in <LOCATION> Amesbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where he was born in 1729; official correspondence; a 1748 receipt for payments to the families of two soldiers and an Indian killed near <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, during the French and Indian War; <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s charter for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; and a copy of a handwritten biography of <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> by his son <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spent an estimated $ 55,000 at the auction, paying $ 13,500 for a printed version of the original charter of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamsphsire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. There also was a 1765 agreement, believed to be one of the first of its kind in the colonies, making Dr. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> an apprentice in <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s medical practice. Only a handful of the estates of the signers of the Declaration of Independence remain with their descendants, according to state archivist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mevers </PERSON>. Ready, 38, owns the home with her aunt, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who wanted to settle the rest of the estate. Ready said they had a choice between dividing everything and selling it item by item or having an auction.

Many wore yellow ribbons, symbolizing their view that the industry is being held hostage by environmental lawsuits over the spotted owl. `` As far as they're concerned, if we turned the whole damned state into a park that would be dandy,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolin </PERSON>, whose husband works in sawmill. Estimated to number fewer than 6,000 in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the owl hunts and nests almost exclusively in the old growth forests that produce the logs most prized by the timber industry. Proposals are being considered that would designate the spotted owl a threatened species. At the owl summit, the timber industry found an ally in <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> when he called for legislation to prohibit legal challenges in court once the administrative process was exhausted over national forest planning. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., opposed the idea, saying the massive <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill might have been averted if environmental groups had n't been barred from court challenges over the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, chairman of the meeting, was unable to get the two sides to agree about how much old growth is remaining. The timber industry maintains there are 7.5 million acres of old growth in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> says it is more like 2.1 million acres. `` Is there any way we can get these groups together to stipulate with some kind of consistency?'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> asked. During the meeting, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to closely examine millions of acres of timberlands that lie between the old growth estimates in an effort to help free up some timber for immediate use. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> challenged whether environmentalists were truly willing to compromise. `` Is it really possible for you folks to engage in a serious discussion of timber supply?'' <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> asked. `` You keep taking away from the base.'' The meeting was called by <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., and <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore The wood products industry is the biggest single industry in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 Government and rebel forces honored the first day of a truce Saturday in the 14-year-old war between the Marxist government and Western-backed rebels, a government official said. `` Hostilities have ceased, but it is necessary to keep vigilance and be ready for combat so that the peace that has been launched becomes real and lasting,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Magalhaes </PERSON> <PERSON> Paiva </PERSON> said. Angolans crowded around newspaper stands in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, the capital, looking for more details of the cease-fire accord that went into effect Saturday, two days after it was signed by President <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was difficult to tell if the cease-fire was holding because most fighting has been concentrated near the Namibian border, about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. The rebel radio carried an announcement that the cease-fire was in place, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state radio broadcast an appeal to troops to put down their weapons. The peace accord was reached Thursday in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, during a summit of 20 African leaders. Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Venancio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>'s diplomatic corps on Saturday that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had `` tacitly accepted'' in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> to `` voluntarily and temporarily'' withdraw his forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, diplomats said. One diplomat also said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> told them that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> `` wants to be a special counselor to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' The Portugese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday quoted unnamed Angolan officials as saying <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> could become <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s representative to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a period of two years. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been pushing for diplomatic recognition by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There was no indication the appointment of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, whose guerrilla movement was backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would lead to recognition. Media coverage of the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> summit here was sparse and most Angolans were unaware of the terms of the pact, which calls for integration of rebel forces into Angolan society and the creation of a national reconciliation commission headed by President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Zairean Vice Premier <PERSON> Nimy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayabika </PERSON> delivered a message to <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> on Saturday and said he was in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> `` to accelerate the implementation of the principles agreed on at <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>.'' The guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, controls areas in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> occupied by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people. The group is known by its Portugese acronym, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. In reports on state-controlled radio and television, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was referred to Saturday as `` <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> president.'' In the past he was referred to as `` traitor,'' `` Judas,'' or `` bandit leader.'' The Gbadolite summit was the first meeting between <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> since the battle for power broke out in 1975 shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, long a <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> ally and credited with a prominent role in the truce, is to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday to discuss peace in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has been fighting to share power with <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' Marxist Popular Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by Cuban forces and Soviet arms. The cease-fire follows U.S.-brokered regional peace accords <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Under the accords, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to allow <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, to gain independence under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan and halt aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas. In exchange, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to a phased withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops backing dos <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' government <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was not party to the agreement.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says Canadian investigators relied on fabricated and erroneous evidence when they probed the 1985 Gander crash that killed 256 Americans. The charge is contained in a letter sent this week to the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the crash of the Arrow Air DC-8 carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops home for Christmas from a peacekeeping mission in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Canadian investigators used a computer simulation to reconstruct the plane's flight path, which gave crucial support to the investigators' theory that wing ice caused the aircraft to stall and crash after takeoff on Dec. 12, 1985. But <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Marthinsen </PERSON>, director of accident investigation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> association said in the nine-page letter that he suspected the simulator used manufactured data. `` It should be clear they simply conjured up their trajectory with faulty, or perhaps more to the point, fabricated data,'' <PERSON> Marthinsen </PERSON> said. `` This -LRB- simulation -RRB- ... represents technical dishonesty at its highest.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officials of the pilot's association were unavailable for comment Saturday. The letter comes at a critical point in the saga of the worst aviation disaster in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Canadian federal government is to receive a report within the next week from an independent investigator, former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Estey </PERSON>. Appointed in March, <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> will appraise the probe and suggest whether a judicial inquiry is warranted. A majority of five Canadian investigating board members concurred with a final report issued in December, but four dissenters said the plane did not stall and concluded an on-board explosion was probably at fault. In his letter, <PERSON> Marthinsen </PERSON> wrote: `` We have over 20 years of experience reading out hundreds of metal foil flight recorder tapes.'' In all these years, we have not seen such abuse of data as in this investigation,'' the letter said. `` The flight recorder was put in airplanes as a tool to assist accident investigators to arrive at the true causes of accidents. They were not intended to allow conjecture which suddenly changes to factual conclusions.'' The crash killed all eight crewmembers and 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel on their way to Ft.. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, Ky

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> Saturday defended the expropriation of three major sugar production facilities, saying they planned to halt production. The expropriations have been sharply criticized by the private sector. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> has accused the leftist Sandinista government of forcing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into `` total radicalization'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> formally broke ties with all government-sanctioned unions and government agencies. The government seized the sugar concerns Wednesday, saying they had adopted `` irresponsible attitudes in the face of the economic crisis confronting the country.'' Ortega Saturday accused the business council and the sugar concerns of planning to halt production and said they were `` agents'' of `` the terrorist policies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' On June 22, the government also took over three coffee plantations owned by its critics. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the growers of trying to sabotage an economic austerity plan to reduce inflation, which last year topped 20,000 percent. As part of the plan, the Sandinista government earlier this week ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency, which sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing. At a meeting Sunday in <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, 80 miles north of the capital, coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. They said the panel, made up of government and private representatives, had ruined the industry. Coffee, like sugar, is one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s main export items and a principal dollar-earner. In June 1988, the Sandinista government confiscated the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> sugar plantation and mills, one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s largest industries.

 An oil tanker from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> ran aground early Saturday, spilling as much as 1.6 million gallons of heavy industrial heating oil in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> just south of here, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The ship has told us 1.6 million -LRB- gallons -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We are going to go with that because we want to be ready to respond to a worst-case scenario.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said there is no way to know exactly how much has spilled because `` a significant'' amount of oil may have sunk. The ship was carrying 28 million gallons. Earlier the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had estimated between 100,000 and 200,000 gallons of refined No. 6 industrial heating oil had leaked from the <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Claymont </LOCATION> is just upriver from <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, the most populated city in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> does not get its drinking water from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Blobs of oil roughly 1 feet to 10 feet in diameter were beginning to surface Saturday night as far as 6 miles upriver and 7 miles downriver from the spill, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The first priority was to unload the ship's cargo so that it could be floated back into the river's channel with the high tide Sunday morning, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Workers could not unload the ship fast enough to meet the 7 p.m. high tide Saturday. After floating the ship, workers can then concentrate on the clean-up, he said. `` The oil is not particularly toxic and we were told by our environmental people to be at least as mindful of doing physical damage to the marshes when placing the booms as being worried about any long-term damage from the oil,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, who supervised the cleanup. Containment booms were placed along creeks, tributaries and bird sanctuaries around the spill. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said officials started with marshes on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> side of the river because they thought the tide would take the oil in that direction. The oil was already collecting on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> side of the shoreline, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> predicted it could pose a serious threat to birds. `` We're afraid it's just a matter of time'' until birds are affected, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said the cause of the accident was under investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials had not determined whether the leak had stopped. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> got an aerial tour of the spill and said it did n't appear as extensive as he had been told. But the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, also toured the site and said the reason it did n't look so bad was likely because most of the oil had sunk. `` It's maddening and it's frustrating,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, who was among about 100 people who gathered to look at the dirty water. `` America is drunk on oil and the government is asleep at the wheel.'' The grounding at 4:45 a.m. ripped open two tanks that contained a total of 5 million gallons on the bottom of the ship, <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said. The remaining oil in the two tanks was being transferred to a barge alongside the vessel. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said the ship was carrying 28 million gallons to <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Claymont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, is just south of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania-Delaware </LOCATION> border, and across the river from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Although the ship was headed upstream, <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said it was pointed downstream after the accident. The bow turned after running aground, leaving the entire ship wedged on a sandbar. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said the captain of the ship is <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrat </PERSON>. Weakly said a local river pilot was on board, but he had no information on who was piloting the ship at the time of the accident. <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Oil </PERSON> hired a pollution cleanup contractor about 5:40 a.m., and that a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> pollution investigative team arrived at 6:30 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boat arrived at 6:50 a.m. `` It is a typical response time,'' <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said any crew members subject to the investigation would be investigated for drug or alcohol use.

 For the second time in little more than a year a sailor has died in a training pool at the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, and an investigation has been ordered, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said Saturday. A naval aviation reserve officer candidate collapsed and died Friday in shallow water after completing an abandon-ship drill, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Malick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was participating in a drill that requires students to jump off a tower and swim a short distance underwater while holding their breath. `` He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of the pool when he collpsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. After he fell back into the water, safety officers pulled the trainee from the pool and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation before an ambulance took him to the off-base <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. Doctors pronounced him dead about 4:15 p.m. `` An investigation has been ordered by the chief of naval air training at the base to determine the circumstances of the death,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. Preliminary autopsy results indicated the cause of death was acute cerebral edema, said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Esty </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Training Command. Edema is an abnormal accumulation of fluid. She said a final autopsy to confirm the cause of death would not be completed for several weeks. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, described his son Saturday as an `` excellent swimmer.'' <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said based on his information from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, it did not appear foul play was involved in his son's death. After the March 2, 1988, drowning of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, five instructors were disciplined, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, Capt. C.L. Lavinder, was officially reprimanded prior to his retirement and four other supervisors were given warning letters. The death of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> during rescue-swimmer training triggered a Navy-wide review of hazardous training and resulted in changes in procedures at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, including a ban against touching students by instructors. A pathologist concluded that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being dragged underwater, which triggered heart failure before he drowned. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, father of the sailor who died Friday, called his son `` an excellent swimmer.'' `` He was a great, great kid,'' <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> said Saturday from his home in <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` He was smart and outgoing.'' He said his son planned to return to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> after the swimming program to complete an engineering degree at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION>, and then planned to resume flight training. In the <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> case, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, lost a stripe and was sentenced to 90 days in the brig after being found guilty of negligent homicide at a court-martial for holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water. The other four instructors received administrative penalties of fines or rank reductions, but the officer in charge of the rescue school, Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, was exonerated at another court-martial. The other instructors had been accused of forcing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool after he had panicked and climbed out, ordering other students to turn away and sing the national anthem while <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> dunked him. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s family has filed a $ 20 million claim against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

In the background were the familiar backdrops from <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday Evening Post covers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, the pharmacy, the town hall and the fire In one convertible was former Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Obanhein </PERSON>, the `` Officer Obie'' made famous by <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s ballad `` Alice's Restaurant'' and the movie based on it Next to the chief was Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the general practitioner who made housecalls for more than 30 years before retiring this year. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> immortalized him as he patiently held a hypodermic needle while a bare-bottomed boy checked the medical degrees hung on his office wall. Police said 5,000 to 7,000 people jammed the town for the festivities, roughly tripling its year-round population.

 Poor visibility and rough currents on Saturday forced organizers of the first human-powered submarine races to scrub much of the day's events. Race spokeswoman <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said the original 1-kilometer loop course was abandoned after most of the 18 submarines had difficulty maneuvering their crafts underwater. She also said judges and timers had problems locating the subs in the rough seas off <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` We're keeping in mind that no one's ever done this before,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Highham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based H.A. <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the event along with <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raton </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, nine submarines completed the straight 100-yard course. The submarine from <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, beat the sub from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, by about eight seconds. Applied Physics Laboratory of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> came in third. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Polytechnic's sub finished the 100-yard course in 1:16.16. Organizers planned more races for Sunday. All the subs are `` wet'' designs that fill up with water and require racers to wear scuba gear. Those propelling the subs say the biggest challenge is to maintain a steady pace and not breathe too quickly, which could lead to light-headedness or blackouts due to oxygen deficiency. The awards ceremony is scheduled for Sunday.

 <PERSON> Chuckie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> was never prouder than when he was wearing the police uniform officers had made for him.

 Caretaker Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, hospitalized with pneumonia, experienced heart and kidney complications early Sunday, hospital officials said. The 70-year-old socialist leader, defeated in elections last Sunday, faces a Tuesday deadline to form a new government. He received the mandate Friday from President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> after conservatives, who made election gains, failed to form a governing coalition. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was admitted to the cardiac section of the hospital Thursday night for treatment of a `` respiratory infection,'' eight months after he underwent open heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In a statement released at 2 a.m. Sunday -LRB- 7 p.m. EDT Saturday -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the premier experienced heart and kidney problems but did not elaborate. The statement said he apparently was responding to treatment for pneumonia. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s ex-wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, rushed to the hospital, where she was joined by their four adult children. Mrs. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> left after an hour and declined to comment. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s 35-year-old live-in girlfriend, former airline hostess <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, was also at the hospital. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> divorced his wife of 38 years just days before the June 18 general election in which his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, was defeated in its bid for a third consecutive term. No one party received an absolute majority in the 300-member unicameral chamber. <LOCATION> PASOK </LOCATION>, with 125 seats, finished a distant second to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which won 145. President <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> to remain as caretaker premier until a new government was formed. Officials at <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, said no political consultations on forming a new government were scheduled during the weekend. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> had been scheduled to confer with the head of the left-wing coalition, <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, to see whether a common ground could be found. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s support eroded after his government was linked to a $ 200 million financial scandal that forced two Cabinet ministers to step down. A leftist coalition, an alliance of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Eurocommunists, rejected <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' proposal to form a temporary coalition government to bring socialist officials accused of wrongdoing to trial before calling new elections. In a power-broker's position after receiving 28 parliamentary places, leftist coalition leaders said they would also turn down <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s overtures. The constitution calls for mandates to be given to all three leading parties. If they fail to receive <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, an attempt is made by the president to form a national unity government composed of nonpolitical personalities acceptable to all political parties. If no solution is found by July 3 when the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to convene, then it is dissolved and a caretaker regime takes over to lead the country to general elections.

 The Sunday Express reported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might help win the release of British hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> promises to restore diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government and make a humanitarian gesture. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper quoted a Lebanese-born <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> citizen, who helped negotiate the release of French hostages, as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds the key to the release of foreign hostages and that <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leaders want contacts with the West. `` All that is required is for Mrs. -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to send people to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to tell the Iranian leaders: ` If you release our hostages, we will start talks about reopening diplomatic relations,' the paper quoted Dr. <PERSON> Razah </PERSON> <PERSON> Raad </PERSON> as saying. `` This should be followed up by a humanitarian gesture, such as sending a ship with medical supplies and nursing volunteers to relieve the terrible suffering of Iranian victims of the war,'' he was quoted as saying. A cease-fire last August brought an end to the fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that began in September 1980 over border conflicts. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seeks the release of three of its nationals held by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, has dual British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality.

 A mile of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coastline was closed to swimmers after an aging pipeline ruptured and poured 900,000 gallons of raw sewage into a creek that flows into the ocean, authorities said. The stretch of <LOCATION> Aliso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, closed Friday, could remain off limits to swimmers for up to a week, health officials said. `` Based on the magnitude of the spill, we expect at least part of the area will remain closed until at least next Friday,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s water quality program `` This is one of the largest spills we've had in a while.'' The spill began when a 40-year-old sewer pipe broke late Thursday night, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, assistant general manager for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. Health officials said bacteria in the water could make people ill if they swim there. The spill was the third of the year in the area, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. About 100,000 gallons of raw sewage flowed into the creek last month when stream erosion caused a sewer line to collapse. Another 175,000 gallons poured into the creek in January when another line broke.

<TEXT>
 The Mail on Sunday newspaper apologized to its readers, saying it misled them to think it published the first interview with author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> since he went into hiding. It said it had made a serious omission last week by failing to say the interview took place weeks before the late Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> urged Moslems to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> went into hiding after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Feb. 14 accused him of blaspheming Islam with his novel and ordered him killed. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died in a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hospital June 3 after a lengthy illness. `` In publishing an interview with <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, we unquestionably misled some of our readers into believing that it had been obtained in recent weeks,'' the newspaper said in what it called an opinion piece in its editions. `` That error _ and it was serious _ we acknowledge and apologize for.'' But the newspaper said it was proud of publishing the interview, which it reported was a reprint of an interview with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist. It called the interview `` a compelling insight of a man on the edge of the most hideous literary controversy of our time.'' In printing the interview June 18, The Mail on Sunday did not say when it had taken place but it did say it occurred `` while journalists throughout the world have been trying to track down <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' It said the interview took place in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ameena </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON>, a writer for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Indian literary magazines. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> denied giving a new interview and called The Mail on Sunday article a `` lurid and sensationalized account'' of the earlier interview. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, is an Indian-born Moslem who is a British citizen.
