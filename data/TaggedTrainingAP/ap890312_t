<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has denied it was behind a multi-million-dollar banking scandal that has rocked <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s governing Socialist party. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement released to the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, also said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government never hired a self-proclaimed <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent who made the allegation. A spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, who requested anonymity, said the statement was given to the state-run television and radio networks Saturday, but by mid-day Sunday it had received no airplay. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party, the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, faced a censure vote Monday brought by the conservative opposition on grounds the government's alleged involvement in a $ 200-million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal threatens the country's security. <LOCATION> PASOK </LOCATION>, with 157 seats in the 300-single chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to weather the motion during a voice vote. The purported agent, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailis </PERSON>, told a parliamentary fact-finding committee last week that fugitive banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employee trying to destabilize <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s government <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> is jailed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> pending an extradition hearing. He faces charges in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in connection with the scandal. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government categorically states that the reported allegations of Mr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailis </PERSON> concerning his connections with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government are completely without foundation,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement released through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The statement, issued `` as an exception to our general policy of not commenting on such matters,'' added that `` neither he nor the others he reportedly has alleged to work for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> now work or ever have worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' On Saturday, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> threatened the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that there would be `` consequences'' if banker-publisher <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was not quickly extradited to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Speaking before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> during a debate on the censure motion, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> did not describe the `` consequences'' but made a reference to his government's decision to shut down one of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. He said talks on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement were continuing, `` but their -LRB- bases -RRB- time of stay in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is running out daily.'' The main conservative opposition <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> submitted the censure motion Thursday on the grounds that alleged government involvement in the scandal posed a `` danger for democracy and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, 34, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in November after being indicted in the scandal. He is jailed in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Time magazine, in an interview with the banker, quoted him as saying <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and senior government officials allegedly authorized plans to embezzle millions from his bank. He also claimed they received millions of dollars in payoffs. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who said he will sue Time for running the interview in its March 13 issue, has charged that there is a `` foreign and domestic plot'' to overthrow his government. To back up the premier's claims of an international conspiracy against him, the state-run television networks and pro-government press have played up the allegations made by <PERSON> Mailis </PERSON> to a parliamentary fact-finding committee investigating the scandal.

 Fire roared through 500 acres of the Big Bend National Park on Saturday, forcing the evacuation of about 100 campers, authorities said. No injuries were reported. `` We speculate it's man-caused,'' said Big Bend National Park spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothe </PERSON>. `` We have n't had any lightning strikes in the area.'' Seventeen firefighters battled the High Chisos mountains blaze which campers reported early Saturday afternoon. A fire crew of Mescalero Apache Indians from <LOCATION> Alamogordo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> was expected Sunday to help fight the fire. ` I can look out the window and see the glow of the fire up in the mountains,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, an assistant manager at <LOCATION> Chisos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lodge </LOCATION> located about 2,000 feet below and at least five miles from the fire. `` The glow of the fire appears over <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. Emory Peak, at 7,830 feet, is the highest point in the <LOCATION> Chisos </LOCATION> range. The fire burned woodlands, mostly oak, pine and juniper and trails in the <LOCATION> Chisos </LOCATION> were closed, officials said. About 100 campers, mostly college students on spring break, were evacuated from the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chisos </LOCATION> area, said park ranger <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rothe </PERSON> said park officials believe the fire would n't spread much Saturday night because of a combination of weather conditions, including falling temperature and wind speed, and rising humidity. The blaze is the first in the 708,221-acre southwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> park this year, Ms. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. Last year there were 27 brush fires, she said, but only two scorched more than 300 acres. The <LOCATION> Chisos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lodge </LOCATION> was filled to capacity with more than 140 visitors Saturday night, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. He said officials told him the fire presented no immediate danger to the lodge.

 Rebels attacked an eastern village Saturday and in the battle six of the raiders and two local officials were killed, the Sandinista government said. <PERSON> Terencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party leader in the village of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iguanas </LOCATION>, 180 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, said two young girls were wounded in the fighting early Saturday. He identified the slain government officials as 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Candido </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, the village's civil defense chief, and <PERSON> Panfilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON>, head of the agricultural cooperative. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON> said the rebels belonged to a group that recently entered <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> accused rebel forces of making more than 140 attacks against Nicaraguan military and civilian targets this year in `` open violation of the cease-fire.'' The rebels' radio station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that Sandinista troops had violated the cease-fire 69 times in 1989. The Sandinistas and rebels agreed to a temporary cease-fire in March 1988 but peace talks subsequently broke down. The government then declared a monthly series of unilateral cease-fires beginning in June 1988 and the insurgents tacitly accepted the truce. Both sides claim they have respected the cease-fires.

<TEXT>
 At first glance, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> might seem an unlikely candidate to run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, but his selection by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won early rave reviews in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In picking the six-term Republican from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved quickly on Friday to fill the void left by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> less than 24 hours earlier. And while the announcement caught most political leaders by surprise, the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> choice at once fulfilled two objectives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers had cited as critical: someone quickly available and someone quickly confirmable. To allow the politically divisive Tower defeat to fester over the weekend _ and to be churned over on Sunday television talk shows and in newspaper columns _ would have not been helpful to the president. So far, the move-quick strategy seems to be working. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders announced immediately that they would hold confirmation hearings in the coming week. `` Congressman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is well known and highly respected by the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and the panel's ranking Republican, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said in a joint statement Although <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, 48, lacks direct defense experience, he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and was senior Republican on the 15-member special panel that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. Equally important, he served as President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s chief of staff. In selecting <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised as a `` widely respected man of principle,'' the president repeated what he had done in filling many other Cabinet slots _ he reached back and picked someone whom had served in a previous Republican administration and with whom he had enjoyed a close working relationship. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> did not get wind of what was in store until Thursday _ as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was at work rejecting Tower _ when he got telephone calls from chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself did n't contact the candidate until just hours before the official announcement. The president's choice makes sense, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` You would n't have thought of him initially because he's not a defense specialist. But in terms of respect in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he's near the top of everyone's list. `` If <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> ca n't make it through the confirmation process, no one can,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to find someone who could sail through, and it was a wise choice.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself called <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` a thoughtful man, a quiet man, a strong man'' who `` approaches public policy with vigor, determination and diligence.'' And, judging from early reaction, most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appear to agree. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has few detractors. `` I have the greatest respect for his broad range of experience and knowledge,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who had been one of Tower's strongest `` I look favorably on this nomination and hope that he will be confirmed expeditiously.'' `` An excellent choice,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, one of the last Democrats to announce opposition to Tower. `` Unless there is a complete void in that area -LRB- defense -RRB-, the confirmation should move rapidly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> praised <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> as a man who `` served with distinction'' in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and promised `` prompt consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' For his part, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he had `` extensive views on defense policy'' and said he was `` eager to get to work.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there was a consensus in the White House that the clock was ticking after the Tower defeat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was being `` encouraged by everyone to do it in a hurry,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said if he had made a mistake in handling the Tower nomination, it was the long delay in sending it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` So when it became clear -LRB- Thursday -RRB- that the votes were n't there ... I began to think and talk to my top advisers here, get opinions from them,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And when he finally talked to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> at 1 p.m. on Friday, the president recalled: `` I said I want to make a decision fast on this, because I know him well and have known him over the years well. And so ... that's about the way it evolved.''

<TEXT>
 An escaped prisoner took six people hostage and held police at bay for 12 hours with an assault rifle, but died early Saturday when a fire and gun battle ended the standoff, officials said. <PERSON> Gomard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON>, 30, released five of the hostages, including a police officer, and the sixth escaped 10 minutes after a tear gas cannister started a fire in a second-floor apartment in the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Waipahu </LOCATION>. Police said it was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> died in the fire, during the gunfight or by his own hand. He was armed with a Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle, authorities said. <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> fired at least seven bursts of three shots each during the standoff, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaainoa </PERSON>. No one was injured by the bullets, police said. The standoff came to a head at 9:25 a.m. with a rapid exchange of gunfire between <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> and police. Police then fired tear gas into the apartment. Police decided to open fire because <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> had been shooting sporadically out of the apartment throughout the morning, said Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Au </PERSON>, head of the detective division. `` We were afraid that some of these shots might injure someone in the community,'' Au said. <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> and 26-year-old <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisbee </PERSON> escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Oahu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cetner </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night by taking two guards hostage with a handgun. Frisbee remained at large Saturday, police said. Both escapees were awaiting trial on numerous charges, including the illegal possession of firearms and terroristic threatening, police said. Police said <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> took three children and an adult hostage around 10 p.m. Friday night. Police said the adult hostage was <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Busano </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON>'s friend and father of the children. At 12:15 a.m. Saturday, <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> released the four hostages in exchange for a police officer and a man identified by witnesses as <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 26. <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON> eventually allowed the officer to leave, according to <PERSON> Roselyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilheln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s girlfriend. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had a leg amputated last month after a gunshot wound became infected, according to his girlfriend, Ms. <PERSON> Wilheln </PERSON> said. He was taken from the apartment by police within 10 minutes of the start of the fire. Police and firefighters found <PERSON> Olayan </PERSON>'s body in the bathroom of the apartment. They entered the apartment at 10:33 a.m., about an hour after the fire broke out. A nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was in good condition. She did not specify <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s injuries. Police said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was arrested, but did not say what charges he faced. Residents of the <LOCATION> Nani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> apartment complex were evacuated and spent the night huddled in blankets at a nearby shopping center.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, director of the hit autism drama `` Rain Man,'' was selected best director of a feature film by the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, as it honored its own at bi-coastal banquets Saturday. Other nominees for the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION>'s achievement award for film direction were <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of the controversial civil-rights film `` Mississippi Burning''; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemeckis </PERSON>, who engineered the animated-live action blockbuster `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit''; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrichton </PERSON>, director of the crime-caper comedy `` A Fish Called Wanda''; and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, who brought the corporate Cinderella saga `` Working Girl'' to the screen. The winner of the prestigious DGA trophy, as selected by the guild's 9,000 members, almost always repeats as best director in the Academy Awards.

 The government has resigned under pressure from labor unions and the military over its failure to end <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil war Newspapers said Sunday the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s junior partner, the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to stay out of the next government because of its objection to a proposal to freeze Islamic law. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> handed his Cabinet's resignation late Saturday to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the country's collective presidency. Ten days earlier, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> and 65 heads of political parties and unions signed a plan calling for a new government. The army, unions, and opposition political groups had issued an ultimatum to form a broad-based government and start peace talks with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the south. There was no word Sunday on when a new government will be named. The capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, tense since the army's ultimatum three weeks ago, was quiet. However, helmeted riot police with shields and batons stood guard on curbs and street corners. The independent daily newspaper <PERSON> Al-Khartoum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s new government will include eight seats for his <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, five for the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and two for the powerful trade unions and professional associations. It would be the first time the unions and associations have shared power since a member of a doctors' group headed a transitional cabinet for a year after the 1985 overthrow of long-time dictator <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Al-Khartoum </PERSON> said parties from war-torn southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> would draw four portfolios, and independent parties and national parties from western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> would get one each. The National Islamic Front will not be in the Cabinet, the newspaper said. The Front has rejected the pact signed 10 days ago by the other parties. The plan calls for immediate endorsement of a peace proposal reached last November by the rebels and the Democratic Unionists.

<HEAD>2 Guerrillas Killed in Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli soldiers killed two Arab guerrillas early Sunday on the northern border of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army said. No Israeli soldiers were hurt in the fighting, an army announcement said. It was the third confrontation between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since February 23. The two other incidents were described by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attempts to carry out attacks inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and became an issue in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. An army announcement referred to the guerrillas as `` terrorists'' but did not indicate if they were Palestinian or Lebanese. A spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she had no information on whether the guerrillas were trying to infiltrate into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The confrontation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> took place near the town of <LOCATION> Hasbaya </LOCATION>, about five miles north of the Israeli border, the army said. <LOCATION> Hasbaya </LOCATION> is within the security zone set up by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protect its northern border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after a three-year occupation. Seven Palestinian guerrillas were killed in the two earlier battles, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said they were members of their group.

<TEXT>
 Students and workers demanding the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo battled hundreds of riot police with firebombs, clubs and rocks Sunday after they were blocked from marching into the streets. Armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchers fired volleys of choking gas into the crowds around <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` Oust <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Thrust a knife into the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime!'' protesters shouted as they charged police and pelted them with rocks and firebombs that spewed blazing gasoline. About 2,000 troopers hurled rocks back as dense clouds of white tear gas cloaked the campus. Police said some officers were injured, but they had no figures. They did not report any arrests. The violence erupted when protesters tried to march out of <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> after about 10,000 workers, dissidents and students held a campus rally to denounce the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and demand free labor unions. South Korean law restricts some trade union activity. In speeches, dissident leaders bitterly attacked the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and big corporations that dominate the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> economy. Speakers said the government and corporations were subjecting people to lives of endless work and poverty. `` Rise up and march forth to let out our anger at the suppressors,'' dissident leader <PERSON> Paik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-wan </PERSON> said as thousands cheered and clapped. Thousands of protesters then marched to the school's main gate, beating drums and jabbing their fists into the air. Protesters burned an effigy of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yong </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest company. Police broke up a protest at the company's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> headquarters last week. Some students armed with clubs and firebombs then surged out of several gates and climbed over the school's walls to attack riot police blocking the way. Most protesters stayed on the campus and did not attack police. The clash, one of the biggest anti-government protests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent months, was confined to the main road in front of the school and lasted about one hour. Riot police guarded government buildings and the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to prevent attacks. There were no reports of any incidents. Dissidents and radical students claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule and seek the overthrow of his government. Dissident leaders say they want to end the domination of the government bureaucracy, the military and big industrial corporations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who took office in February 1988, has introduced broad democratic reforms. But many South Koreans oppose his government because of its ties to past authoritarian regimes. The dissidents have little public support, but they have been showing new strength following the formation in January of a new anti-government alliance. The anti-government students back the alliance.

 Since <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> made his 15-minute suborbital flight aboard the Mercury capsule Freedom 7 in 1961, counting down the final seconds to launch has been a man's job. On Monday, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> changes all that. The 27-year-old public affairs specialist with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will replace <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the voice of Shuttle Launch Control for the liftoff of Discovery. It will be the first time a woman has served as launch commentator for a flight carrying astronauts. Her job will be to guide the news media and the public through the anxious minutes before the main engines ignite in a burst of flame and smoke, until the shuttle clears the launch tower and communications switch to the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Her challenge to explain what is taking place behind the scenes and to translate the technical chatter among launch managers into `` something that anybody can understand.'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> is quick to contrast the significance of her new role with that of female astronauts. `` I think what they're doing is a lot more trendsetting and important than what a commentator does,'' she said, `` because they're actually doing it instead of reporting on what's been done.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said, she likes to think her voice will be an inspiration to young women. `` If that would inspire somebody to go on and achieve what they want in life,'' she says, `` I think that is fantastic.'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> has worked for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> for seven years, rising to her position of space shuttle specialist from a college work-study program that started while she was earning a bachelor's degree in journalism from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. She edited the space center newsletter, Spaceport News, for three years before she was assigned to the space shuttle beat. Now, she attends several daily meetings of launch managers to stay up-to-date on the progress of work to get three orbiters and their external fuel tanks and booster rockets ready for flight. To prepare for her debut, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> provided launch commentary for some unmanned Atlas Centaur and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> launches and for the early portions of some shuttle countdowns. She has watched numerous launches from her seat at the firing room console beside <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is now deputy director for public affairs at Kennedy Space Center. She also hired a voice coach. Although she has learned the lingo and has carefully prepared a script, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> knows her biggest challenge will be the `` real-time element of the job'' _ and how she'll react if there's an unexpected problem during the countdown. `` You're going to be scrambling to try and figure out what it is because you want to have the right story before you tell the world what's going on,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Time passes slowly for <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>. The Italian woman has fallen into a routine of staying awake 23 hours, then sleeping for 10, after being holed up in a cave for two months as part of a research project into the effects of isolation. She has no sun, radios or clocks to guide her sense of time, and little contact with other humans. `` Sunday, Feb. 12, 10 a.m.,'' Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> writes on a computer at a desk in her plastic habitat at one end of the cave. Actually, it's noon on Wednesday, March 8. On Jan. 13, the 27-year-old Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> climbed 30 feet below the earth's surface and into the 200-foot-long Lost Cave in the hills west of <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> to begin a four - to five-month isolation experiment An Italian research group is sponsoring the experiment, along with various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. As she moves about in her two-room, 200-square-foot Plexiglas house, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> resembles a laboratory rat in a cage. Researchers monitor her with three video cameras and microphones, and they type in occasional messages to her computer, but Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> can not see or hear another human. During her waking hours, she sometimes taps away at her computer like a subject in a <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> experiment as researchers in a trailer above record the results of tests of her concentration, memory and reasoning ability. One thing researchers are discovering in isolation experiments _ intended, among other things, to give them insight into how humans might react on interplanetary space flights _ is that men tend to be more cheerful in long isolation than women. <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, the experiment coordinator who once spent six months isolated in a cave, alludes to that in a brief computer conversation in Italian with his fellow native of <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` You should change your sex,'' <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> writes to the glum-looking Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>. `` You always seem like a sad one.'' `` I feel sadder some times than others,'' she replies. After chatting via computer for a little bit, <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> asks Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> to take the series of computerized mental tests, which she performs about once a week. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, who had been interrupted from reading a novel to take the medical measurements and relay them by computer, becomes a little sarcastic. `` Great idea, like a dessert!'' she responds. An interior decorator by profession, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> has livened up her 10-by-10-foot living area with colorful figures cut out of construction paper and glued to the walls. Among the paper decorations: wine bottles, a flower box and a `` window,'' covered with blue paper lace curtains, that looks out onto a white paper moon and stars. A brown paper cat sits beside the windowsill. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> spends much of her time kneeling on a blue mat, reading. She brought 400 books with her: novels, histories, English primers. She stays in shape by practicing judo moves. She is remarkably quiet. Even though researchers can hear her, she prefers to communicate with them by computer. She does talk a little to her pets _ two mice she dubbed <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicoleta </PERSON>, and a salamander _ all found in the cave. She keeps a vigil to prevent the rodents from gnawing at cables or eating her food, which consists mostly of rice and beans she cooks on an electric stove. Long-term space flight might be a lot like this, except for the lack of gravity in space. Medical researchers are especially interested in finding out what isolation does to one's emotional and mental well-being. `` <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> is fine,'' says <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvagno </PERSON>, an Italian doctor who alternates 24-hour monitoring shifts with <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>. `` As of now, she has n't expressed any desire that deals with the outside world.'' But it appears Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s world is n't quite a utopia. She occasionally attaches electrodes to her head before she falls asleep so researchers can study her brain waves in various stages of sleep, and the results show symptoms of mild depression. <PERSON> Galvagno </PERSON> says he and <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> sometimes joke around with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> to buoy her spirits. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> says Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s ability to concentrate has deteriorated. In previous experiments, people in isolation alone have improved their concentration, while members of groups isolated in caves have lost their concentration. About this time, around 4:30 p.m., Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> walks over to her computer, types in `` Ciaoooooooo,'' waves to the video camera, dims the lights _ they always stay on _ lies on the mat under a blanket and stares at the camera a while. Presently she closes her eyes and falls asleep: <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, a brown paper cat, two mice and a salamander.

So far, <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON> has not found a publisher. `` It's not easy to get someone to publish a book that is connected to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, who spent the past 18 months translating the first volume of `` Mein Kampf.'' `` But 50 years after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, we must be strong enough to look at who he was,'' said <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, who fled his native <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1938 after watching Nazi troops parade down the main street of the Austrian capital. <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, a retired educator, said in an interview that young Jews should read `` Mein Kampf'' as a warning against racist ideology. He said, for example, that there were disturbing anti-Arab sentiments expressed by extreme right Israeli politicians. `` The new generation needs ... to know about the dangers that can occur,'' he said. `` There are -LRB- Israelis -RRB- who promote racism.'' <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON> said the fact his parents were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> while trying to escape from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> has strengthened his determination to see the book published in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` If people like my father ... would have had the internal strength to read the book, they would have known, and things would have ended differently,'' he said. Other Holocaust refugees vehemently disagree with <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, saying publication would stir deep emotion in a nation that was founded in part to shelter the survivors of the Nazi horrors. If it is published, `` there will be battles in the street,'' predicted <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Klieger </PERSON>, a survivor of the <PERSON> Aushwitz </PERSON> concentration camp, who covers Holocaust affairs for the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` We need freedom of opinion, but there is a limit, and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is the limit,'' he said in an interview. `` The man who wrote this book destroyed _ physically destroyed _ a third of the Jewish people.'' <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayek </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> of Jewish Fighters, Partisans, and Camp Inmates, also opposes publication. `` Jews do n't need to read about the worst anti-Semitism the world has ever seen,'' he said. `` We do n't need to revive <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, certainly not in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, definitely not in Hebrew.'' He said some Holocaust survivors were considering legal action to stop publication. But he said the federation decided against doing anything, believing there was no real interest in the book. If published, he said, `` I think ... the book will end up in a warehouse and not people's bookshelves,'' <PERSON> Grayek </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION> national Holocaust memorial has refused a request to publish the translation, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I question why anyone would publish the book,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>. `` It's going to upset a lot of people, and I ca n't see it selling a lot of copies. `` The book is available in its original language, and if researchers want to gain access to the book it is best that they study it in the original language,'' he said.

 An 81-year-old man struck a bank robber with a karate-style chop after seeing him hit a female teller, causing the robber to drop a bag of money and flee, authorities said. `` I do n't believe in hitting ladies,'' said the elderly customer, who asked not to be identified.

 When Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> came under <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attack during the debate over <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination as defense secretary, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> stepped forward to deflect the blows. And when the Republicans switched gears and insisted that the key issue was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prerogative of picking his own Cabinet, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> deftly rebutted by cautioning against `` self-righteousness.'' `` Do n't get too locked into your present views,'' the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senator said after reciting chapter and verse a series of past <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> votes against high-level <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> appointees. `` You may get into another one in not too long.'' If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had much at stake in the Tower fight that culminated with rejection of the nomination, so did <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a 55-year-old <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> native of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> whose rise to the pinnacle of power in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been extremely rapid by congressional standards. A former federal judge who was appointed to office in 1980, he won an underdog's race for a six-year term in 1982 and parlayed that into a landslide re-election in 1988. He presided over the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee that helped oust the Republican majority in 1986 and two years later he won a three-way race to become majority leader. He has stressed cooperation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the early months of his tenure, yet also outlined a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> agenda that includes ethics legislation, environmental concerns and social issues such as raising the minimum wage. Still, a miscue could have marred his first appearance in a leading role for a party trying to maintain its standing during lengthy Republican control of the White House. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> walked a narrow line. He stressed throughout the debate that he meant no political injury to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Yet he also was the careful keeper of the vote count that sealed Tower's rejection. He put his low-key debating style on display for the first time in contrast to veteran GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s more aggressive approach. Moreover, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> apparently emerged without unduly antagonizing senators on the other side of the aisle. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> probably will be back to normal within a month or two despite bruised feelings over the Tower episode. `` I think you can say that the nomination is gone but not forgotten,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` The memories will be around for a while. There will be some bruised feelings. But I think in probably 30 to 60 days we'll be back to normal. The scars are n't that deep.'' One Democratic committee chairman, speaking anonymously, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s approach was to avoid the appearance of partisanship, yet at the same time to support <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who recommended rejection of Tower's nomination. `` I thought he acted calm and cool throughout. He made nobody mad on the Democratic side,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., one of three Democrats to vote in favor of confirmation `` He never did any real what you call arm-twisting.'' In the same vein, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> minimized the importance of the Tower debate to his own political fortunes even as he acknowledged judgments `` inevitably'' would be made on how he performed. After initially remaining in the background, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> assumed an increasingly prominent role in the confirmation struggle. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> learned Monday night that the votes were in hand to defeat Tower's nomination, and let the Republicans know by telling reporters on Tuesday. The following day _ Wednesday _ Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> became the third Democrat to announce his support of Tower. But then a string of three wavering Democrats quickly came to the floor and declared their opposition. The effect was to blunt the impact of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s long-awaited decision and seal Tower's defeat. It all bore the marks of skillful behind-the-scenes stage managing. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> worked closely and several Republicans said it was the decision by the highly respected <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to oppose Tower that made confirmation difficult to achieve. Yet when <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> himself came under attack from Republicans for detailing investigators from a subcommittee he heads to check out allegations against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> came to his defense. `` We are not going to get in a position here where one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people come over here and ask the same question and the senator -LRB- <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> -RRB- has to give the same answer over again,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. And he showcased his debating skills when he replied to persistent <ORGANIZATION> Repulican </ORGANIZATION> claims that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was entitled to have the nomination confirmed as a matter of presidential prerogative. If they serve long enough, he said, all senators of both parties `` will inevitably contradict ourselves. We will meet ourselves coming around the corner on some issue.'' He cited Repulican opposition to several appointments made by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> a decade ago and said: `` There was no talk then about the president having his own way. There was no talk then about the president winning the last election. There was no talk then about the future of the confirmation process. There was no talk then about the fairness of the process.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also worked to thwart <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s more aggressive approach to the debate and his efforts to shake loose a few extra votes by accusing the Democrats of treating Tower unfairly. When <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested that Tower be given the right to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and respond to allegations against him, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> immediately replied that he would be willing to give it serious consideration. By not rejecting the proposal outright, several Democrats said, the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senator denied <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> the right to level a fresh charge of unfairness. And when <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> finally made a formal proposal on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor _ after the outcome of the struggle was clear _ <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> blocked it and the Republicans did not pursue it.

 The spotlight of the John Tower controversy proved hotter than <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had anticipated and the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator now yearns for a chance to lower his profile. `` I'd like to go down to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and check titles on real estate for about six months,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told reporters at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The reporters laughed and the senator smiled. But he looked like a man who meant what he said. Like it or not, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> will have to reconcile himself to a prominence most politicians would relish. For the first time in his public career, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was the target of partisan attacks from opponents who questioned his tactics and motives as the leader of the opposition to the Tower nomination. It was a trial by fire that seems to have strengthened his standing as a national figure. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may not like the role <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> played in defeating his first choice to head the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, but the president seemed as eager as <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to get the bitterness behind him. Before the Tower debate, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was seen as a figure apart from politics. `` Respected'' was the word most often used to describe the bespectacled Georgian who had carved out a reputation as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s foremost authority on defense issues. The past couple of years saw a shift in <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s approach. No longer did he shy away from partisan jabs at the Republican administration. He mulled a run for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned extensively for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his ill-fated effort to regain the presidency for the Democrats. But the Tower nomination was a much more dramatic step into the thick of partisan politics. That battle over, the question he often is asked is, what next? `` I have no plans or any inclination to run for president in 1992,'' he said. `` I'd like to have s much lower profile.'' As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had the kind of forum he seems to relish _ one that features an often dry discussions of issues. Without question, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was the dominant figure at the two-day meeting, despite the presence of three of the contenders for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` When the history of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is written, it will be about <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` He represents the best that our democratic society has to offer.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s tribute to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was all the more striking for being just one of many voiced during the conference. But while <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was bombarded with the sort of flattery that would prompt most politicians to begin thinking about their Cabinet choices, a bid for the presidency would make the fight over Tower seem gentle. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> represents his party's most conservative wing. While he commands unquestioned respect on defense issues his support for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic program would and his conservative positions on other domestic issues would raise bitter opposition from the party activists who still control the presidential nominating process. The ideological split in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was dramatized by the presence at the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION> meeting of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who symbolizes an approach the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION> was created to combat. `` Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a very credible spokesman for his point of view,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` Obviously, he and I have some very fundamental differences in philosophy.'' Those differences will not easily be bridged. -0

 Its name is virtually synonymous with planning. But 25 years after its founding as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first planned city, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> belatedly is allowing for the one thing besides taxes that everyone must face _ death. Burying the dead was n't on the minds of <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials in 1963 when they purchased 15,000 acres of farmland and mapped out a city of the future. Consultants on recreation, education, sociology and other fields were hired to prescribe ideal living conditions for urbanites weary of depersonalized existence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s metropolitan sprawl But somehow, with its focus on living well, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> never made provisions for what comes afterward. This city of 70,500 souls had no cemetery. `` My understanding is that it was overlooked in the beginning. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> James </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> had very detailed plans. ... He hired all kinds of experts. The one expert he forgot was a cemetery expert,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, who is one. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> turned over 28 acres in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> and assigned him to create a graveyard. Last Monday, <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> watched as the first burial took place. `` We had enough road to accommodate them, luckily. We've only cleared about five acres,'' <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> said. In fact, there is n't much to see of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ just a circular driveway inside a low, curving stone wall. So far, about 20 plots have been sold and two funerals have been held. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s organizers have had little time to think about final resting places. Amenities of gracious living that are in place or on the drawing board include playgrounds, bike and jogging paths, a shopping mall, cultural centers, an athletic club, golf course, community pools and a bowling alley. In the 1960s, the city _ built in rural <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ acquired a reputation for addressing urban problems through innovative, comprehensive planning. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which welcomed its first residents in 1967, is seeing its population graying. The people who bought houses in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in their 30s and 40s are approaching retirement. About 60 percent of <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s senior citizens now live in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> or in nearby <LOCATION> Ellicott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` It was built as a young persons' city, but what happened was the old folks came to live near their kids,'' <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Scavo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> vice president who is overseeing the cemetery, said it has taken two decades for a graveyard to become economically feasible. `` I'm not sure it was overlooked. The market was n't here,'' he said It's still not clear how large that market is. As they approach their twilight years, even residents who love <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> apparently are not anxious to stay there eternally. The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Golueke </PERSON> of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said none of the 2,400 families in his parish has mentioned a desire to be buried in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. But having a cemetery in the community `` does give people some type of roots,'' the priest said. `` I guess you know you've made it as a city when you have a cemetery.'' <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> residents began to talk about a cemetery in the 1970s, but no developer was interested. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> finally ended up doing the first phase of construction itself and giving the land to <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> to manage, <PERSON> Scavo </PERSON> said. The cemetery is expected to be able to support itself after the 25,000 graves are sold, probably in about 50 years. Cemeteries rely on trust funds financed by plot sales to pay for perpetual maintenance. The company _ a stickler for design rules _ had its own ideas about how the tract was to look. Statues, elaborate mausoleums, even simple white crosses were ruled out. Graves will be marked by bronze plates set in the ground, with nothing above ground except landscaping, a small chapel in a grove, and a communal mausoleum. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunier </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, a citizen watchdog group, said she thinks the cemetery's time has come. `` It was the one thing we did n't have,'' she said. `` If you feel strongly about your community, you may want -LRB- to be buried there -RRB-. I think a lot of people do, and I think that will increase as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> gets older.''

 A new government publication tries to fix the proper name on every species of fish that might end up on an American's plate so one diner's striped bass will no longer be another's rockfish. Just off the government's presses is `` The Fish List: <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Guide to Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>,'' intended to end the confusion that arises because fishes swim under so many aliases. The book assigns a market name to each fish from sea, stream or lake that is sold in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and gives the scientifically-acceptable common name for each. It also tells how the fish is known locally, often by different names in different places. Fish dealers may sell their wares under either market name or common name, but none other. What some people call the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> mackerel and others call the common mackerel and still others know as the caballa, the booklet shows, are all one fish with the scientific Latin name Scomber scombrus. Scomber scombrus may be sold simply as mackerel, its market name, or as <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> mackerel, its science-accepted common name. The booklet lists 1,042 species, all fish sold for food in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But, admits fish list compiler <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, assistant to the director of the Division of Regulatory Guidance at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have missed many. I get calls every day about fish that are n't on the list.'' Rockfish illustrate the name problem. `` People in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> area call striped bass rockfish,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` To the rest of the country the rockfish is a completely different fish,'' she said. `` It is related to ocean perch, which is a rough looking fish _ squatty and with rough scales and spiny fins. What we here in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area call a rockfish is cigar-shaped, has stripes and is very different.'' The government has long required the marketing of fish under uniform, government-accepted names. What's new is the guidebook. It was produced by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> because, Mrs. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said, fish dealers who called for guidance sometimes got inconsistent answers. What `` The Fish List'' establishes is how species with delicious commercial names are sometimes known locally by names so unappealing that anyone would be tempted to toss them back. Take the fish known to science as the Lethrinus spp. Its commercial name is emperor, but it is known in some places as the longnosed pigfaced bream, elsewhere as the rosefaced pigface bream and in yet other places as the mu. What is sold as the grunt is known in some places as the brown sweetlips. Some people call some anchovies the smig. Others call the grenadier the rattail. Uniform commercial names combat marketplace deception. About a month ago, the government seized 45,672 pounds of frozen fish fillets imported from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. They arrived labeled orange roughy, a tasty, expensive fish, when in fact they were merely the smooth oreo dory, a cheaper fish. The book lists 24 species of croaker, 38 of snapper, 18 of eel, 62 of rockfish, 31 of grouper, 15 of grunt, 21 of anchovy, 34 of shark, and 21 of mackerel _ including the jack mackerel, chub mackerel, king mackerel, snake mackerel and the Japanese scad, <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> scad or rough scad. These scads are mackerels, no matter what they're called. When the consumer buys flounder, he may be buying peacock flounder one time, tropical flounder another time _ or panther flounder, <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> flounder, yellowtail flounder, Arctic flounder or any of 35 other species of flounder. It does n't matter, said Mrs. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. They are so much alike in taste and appearance that the customer would n't know the difference. Only another flounder could tell one from another.

 Some people think they have space problems when the hall closet wo n't take one more winter coat or when there's no more room in the attic for grandma's collection of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographics </ORGANIZATION>. That's nothing. The Field Museum of Natural History is trying to cope with 2 million beetles, 9.6 million insect specimens, 1.7 million fish, 381,000 birds, 2.4 million plants, a half-million fossils, 600,000 artifacts _ 20 million specimens in all with 400,000 more coming in each year. `` We're approaching a sort of gridlock,'' said the museum's geology department chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> The botany department bulges with twice as many plant specimens as it was designed to hold. And the geology department is cramming so many fossils into storage drawers that some may get damaged. The museum, which says its holdings are widely used by researchers, is planning to close two courtyards inside the building for construction of more storage, and is considering building four underground, two-story vaults.

 Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did n't wait long to call President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his promise to raise the minimum wage. Democrats who saw their attempt to raise the $ 3.35 an hour wage floor founder last year have renewed it with greater resolve, setting up an early confrontation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a domestic issue that reaches deep into the wallets of millions of Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists he will veto what may become the first piece of major legislation to reach his desk if it does n't match his plan, despite agreeing that the minimum should be raised for the first time in eight years. `` $ 4.25, that's it,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee earlier this month, drawing a line she says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not cross. But Democrats are putting their more ambitious increase on the `` fast track,'' using the minimum wage to take the lead on domestic legislation after eight years of frustration under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` If it's the judgment that -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will -RRB- veto it, we'll override it.'' Quick action in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ and the concession by Democrats that a sub-minimum wage they have long considered poison could be part of a compromise _ has sparked hopes the minimum will be raised for the first time since 1981. `` An increase in the minimum wage for the nation's lowest paid employees is long overdue, and it is well past time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said earlier this month. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s committee recently passed his plan to raise the minimum to $ 4.65 in three annual stages and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved a virtually identical plan on Thursday. The dollar difference is this: Democrats would take the minimum to $ 3.85 an hour immediately and then add 40 cents a year for the following two years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would add 30 cents an hour annually for three years. The main political battleground, however, is over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desire to add a second tier to leave the minimum at $ 3.35 an hour for the first six months of employment for all newly hired workers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls it a `` training wage,'' although opponents deride the term because there are no requirements for any training. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, long opposed to a second scale, said last week he'd be `` glad to listen'' to a limited version. But he added, `` I'm not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage by using the words ` training wage' to throw older workers out of work and displace those who want to work 40 hours a week.'' Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was drawing up his own version of the reduced wage as an alternative to the Republican plan and may introduce it on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor An aide said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is looking at a duration of 30 to 90 days for a sub-minimum, and would likely tie it to a percentage of the standard minimum. Labor Department figures show slightly fewer than 4 million people work for the minimum wage, about 15 percent of them heads of households. Some 11 million others earn less than $ 4.55 an hour, according to a report on the raise that failed last year, and so could see fatter paychecks if the minimum is boosted. The last time the rate was raised was in 1978, when it was boosted in four stages that ended with the $ 3.35 an hour standard in 1981. `` Inflation has eroded the current minimum by 38 percent,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The administration's plan would eventually raise the minimum by 26.8 percent while Democrats want a 39 percent hike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> puts the argument in terms of jobs, saying 650,000 people would be thrown out of work if the minimum is raised to $ 4.65. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the raise to $ 4.25 would cost 450,000 jobs, but other provisions would make up part of that loss. However, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that since it was established in 1938, `` each time the minimum wage increased, employment also increased, with the two recession years the sole exception. Frustrated by watching social programs suffer during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, Democrats are keying their minimum wage plans to the hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't use his veto power `` I take it seriously, but not very,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a member of the labor committee, said of the threat. `` I've been around long enough to know that when a president threatens a veto, sometimes it means he will veto and sometimes it means the beginning of the negotiating process.

 Four Roman Catholic parishes may start a pilot project to encourage `` sacrificial giving,'' similar to the practice of tithing, because parishioners are n't giving enough to allow church employees to get raises, a church official said. Bishop <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON> and the diocese's council of priests are considering a proposal to encourage a `` sacrificial giving'' program in four parishes that would be modeled on the tithing practice, said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>, vicar for planning and finance of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. The average parishioner puts roughly 1.1 percent of his or her take-home pay in the collection plate, <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said Saturday at a day-long conference for religious education teachers. As a result, the diocese has been unable to raise salaries for parochial school teachers and other workers to keep up with public school salaries in the past three years, he said. Some Protestant denominations practice tithing, which requires congregants to give up to 10 percent of their incomes to the church.

 All the budget talk now going on wo n't shrink the deficit much unless <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional leaders conquer a pervasive feeling that it's politically best to let the problem slide until next year. `` The smarter strategy would be to take the strong steps now,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` But I'm not kidding myself. Right now the votes are not there ... for that kind of package.'' Fiscal policy experts agree it's better to reduce the deficit while the economy is strong. Government statistics last week showed unemployment at a 15-year low, and other signs are positive. A new round of negotiations on the fiscal 1990 budget, with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees, began Thursday and will resume Tuesday. `` There is still a great deal of hope and we're working together,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But the politicians have proven themselves unable to act without some kind of calamity that creates public pressure, such as the 1987 stock market crash that forced a modest, two-year budget agreement between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. No such crisis now exists. People `` do n't see the greater evil lying out there from inaction,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON>, director of the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The budget negotiators `` do n't have any outside pressure either from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people or the economy to bolster up their backbone.'' <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> director two weeks ago, agrees with the many economists who believe the deficit probably wo n't cause an immediately perceptible crisis as it gradually gnaws away at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic strength. `` In an abstract sense, the vast majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people think something should be done,'' he said. But unless there's a crisis such as a Wall Street crash or runaway inflation, `` they are not willing to admit that they or their programs should be a part of the solution.'' `` There's a key element missing from the budget debate. And that's a reason to act,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, a former staffer on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees who now monitors federal economic policy for the firm of Price Waterhouse. The Gramm-Rudman law was designed to create artificial crisis and force action, using the threat of across-the-board spending cuts if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president failed to meet pre-set deficit limits. But those ceilings depend on White House forecasts for the economy and government spending. And, critics say, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 budget falls back on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s habit of manipulating those forecasts to minimize tough budget choices For example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to bail out the savings and loan industry was created to be `` off-budget.'' Tens of billions of dollars of costs thus do not show up on the balance sheets, and the administration can claim it is meeting the Gramm-Rudman goal of a deficit no larger than $ 100 billion in the new fiscal year. `` Spending saves money. Up is down. Black is white ... This is an all-time low water mark in terms of kidding ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, who also cited the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget reliance on projections of sharply lower interest rates _ at the same time rates are going up. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unwilling to confront the deficit head-on, `` all of the incentives are for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to buy additional smoke and mirrors'' to avoid unpopular spending cuts or challenging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a tax increase, she said. `` I fearlessly predict the deficit next year wo n't be much lower -LRB- than this year -RRB-,'' she said. The deficit has actually gone up in the last two years despite much-ballyhooed plans that were supposed to reduce it. The government now expects red ink to exceed $ 170 billion this fiscal year, although Gramm-Rudman called for $ 136 billion. Further hindering bold moves this year, especially from the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is political distrust. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told reporters last week he has assured Democrats the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would step forward and share blame for unpopular parts in a budget package. But there is widespread doubt among the opposition party that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would control such partisans as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign office. And Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> remember taking a gutsy stand to reduce the deficit in 1985 with a plan that included cutting back Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Democrats hammered them with that vote, and wrested away control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think after five years of almost continuous budget warfare that has torn apart the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... this has become awfully fruitless ground to plow,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, staff chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when the Republicans were in control. By relying on the rosy assumptions, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president need to restrain spending growth or raise revenues by only about $ 13 billion out of a $ 1.16 trillion spending plan in order to avoid the Gramm-Rudman automatic cuts. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, predicts: `` A slide-through, glide through budget resolution.'' The participants in the talks wo n't say that themselves, but Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and the White House were privately seeking `` a minimalist approach. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said privately that he might look at a tax increase next year. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> denied it, but many on Capitol Hill say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, which carefully avoided spelling out billions of dollars in spending cuts, made clear that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was no more willing to tackle the deficit than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ought to get rid of this budget year as quickly as we can because then, maybe next year, we can really get serious,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>

 An Iranian newspaper Sunday blamed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain's van and said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tried to implicate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the attack to justify deportation of Iranian students. The English-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> linked the alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to Western anger at <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed for his new novel, `` The Satanic Verses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday the bombing of the van, driven by the wife of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man who mistakenly ordered the destruction of an Iranian passenger jet, was being investigated as a possible terrorist attack. The bombing `` will not be the last attempt to implicate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'' over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> controversy, <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial summarized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper noted that one day before Friday's bombing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing was held at which an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said thousands of `` zealous'' Iranian students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pose a great threat to Americans. Therefore, the editorial said, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not surprised when `` the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> said that it was investigating possible Iranian involvement'' in the bombing. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> denied the allegation and added, `` we have never made any linkage to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since this incident happened.'' `` We have n't gotten to the point -LRB- in the investigation -RRB- where we could make such a linkage,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted the newspaper as saying the explosion was designed `` to create the necessary climate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that would justify the expulsion of Iranians.'' No one was injured in the blast that destroyed a van driven by <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the wife of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> got out of the van when she heard a noise witnesses described as `` two loud pops.'' The van exploded and burned moments later. As commander of the guided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> ordered the destruction of what he thought was an Iranian F-14 jet fighter July 3 after the craft failed to respond to warnings in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The aircraft was actually an Iranian civilian jet, and all 290 people aboard were killed. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> later said he acted to protect his ship and crew. He was backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which also decided to compensate the victims' families. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, has alleged that Western governments may carry out terrorist attacks and link them to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in retaliation for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death order against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, which was issued Feb. 14. Many Moslems believe `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam, and Iranian clerymen have put a $ 5.2 million bounty on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head. The author, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family, has been in hiding since Feb. 14. At Thursday's hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said about 15,000 `` zealous'' Iranian students are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and might try to seek revenge against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> supporters. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> `` Buck'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee looking into the impact of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death order that the students are particularly dangerous because they can not be monitored and because the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s standards for issuing visas are lax. The controversy over the death sentence led <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to break diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in turn announced it was expelling up to 30 Iranians. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashami </PERSON> as also calling for an economic embargo of British goods. `` If we boycott <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> economically, we will strike the heaviest blow on this old colonialist country and supporter of infidelity,'' he said Sunday.

 She once sang of broken hearts and lonely nights to boozy lounge lizards, but <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>'s singing career really took off when she switched to children and the joys of eating broccoli or splashing in a bubble bath. Known simply as <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> _ `` <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> is too much of a mouthful for kids,'' she says _ the 33-year-old mother from suburban <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is playing to growing audiences of youngsters and their parents with her toe-tapping, finger-snapping tunes and gentle ballads, many inspired by her sons <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, 16 months. She and guitarist-arranger <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Guernsey </PERSON> have produced their first album, `` I'm Just a Kid!,'' containing 10 songs that blend jazz, blues, Broadway show tunes, Motown, pop and 50s doo-wop in a musical style that <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> calls `` kidrock.'' Sales figures since the album was released last August on her Roar Music label suggest that it's a big hit among kids caught in the musical no man's land between cutesy nursery rhymes and <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>'s teen-oriented heavy metal Their baby-boomer parents seem to like it, too. Her national distributor, <ORGANIZATION> Alcazar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, says more than 3,000 albums were sold in the first three months, already the fastest-selling debut by a children's singer. Sales, mostly in book and toy stores, could top 200,000 in the first year. <PERSON> Rory </PERSON>'s concert dates have taken her from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and they're accelerating. She expects eventually to perform 50 to 75 out-of-town engagements annually. She and <LOCATION> Guernsey </LOCATION> just completed their second children's album and will start work soon on a third. They're making plans to produce a full-length music video. <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> has appeared on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' and several other network shows, and is a regular guest on radio talk shows. It's all a far cry from the seven years when <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> sang Top 40 hits at nightclubs, shopping malls, high school proms and and motel lounges, and recorded radio jingles for fast-food restaurants and local auto dealerships. She played in some real dives, she recalls. Like bowling banquets in American Legion halls and `` joints where bouncers had to take customers outside,'' she said. Once, she dutifully sang requests all evening for a drunk who threw up on her before he passed out. Worse, her career was going nowhere fast. After her marriage to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> builder <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> in 1981 and the birth of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> listened to children's music for hours. `` I heard a lot of nice sounds, a lot of folk and nursery rhymes, but nothing that was terribly creative,'' she said in an interview between studio recording sessions. `` A lot of people assume that kids' music should be very quiet and very sweet and dull,'' she said. But she learned from <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> that `` kids are much more sophisticated that we give them credit for. And they can pick up the lyrics and rhythm of a song much faster than adults do.'' <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Guernsey </LOCATION>, who has teen-age children and also was reared on the 60s sounds of the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, started composing their own stuff about two years ago to try to fill the gap. The infectious rub-a-dub rhythm of `` Bubble Bath'' is a favorite of her toddler <PERSON> Max </PERSON>. The Incredible Piglets, stage puppets created by a <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensen </PERSON> designer, echo Motown's Supremes as they extoll the delights of broccoli, squash and even rutabaga. `` Eating veggies is our thing,'' they squeal. From a clash between <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, stuck at home and bored on a rainy afternoon, came the lyrics to another song -LRB- `` You, you're drivin' me crazy, even though I'm crazy for you'' -RRB- that examines family frictions through the eyes of both parent and child She and <LOCATION> Guernsey </LOCATION> are n't preachy moralists, <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> said, but if they have a message it's to urge parents to `` lighten up and not take everything so seriously.'' `` Quit putting flash cards in the crib, quit pushing your kids to be rocket scientists at age 3,'' she said. `` Let them have fun and be innocent as long as they can, and do n't forget to be a kid when you're an adult.''

<HEAD>It Often Produces More Rhetoric Than Results</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nine-member congressional commission recently recommended a 50 percent pay raises for judges, government officials and lawmakers. Nobody got a penny of it. A 14-member commission created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> labored for a year on ways to reduce the federal deficit. It ended hopelessly deadlocked. Now an eight-member commission appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to come up with ethical standards applying equally to all three branches of government has reported that it ca n't be done. The ethics panel report released Friday is one more bit of evidence that sometimes the commissions government creates to help with its problems produce more rhetoric than results. `` As a mayor or a governor or a president or a legislative body that is being criticized for something looks for something to do, one of the easiest things to do is to study the matter, to create a commission,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, a former secretary of defense and a member of the deficit reduction panel. `` Some serve a useful purpose, some do n't,'' he added. As <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> noted, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has no monopoly on the idea of a study panel. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisciotte </PERSON>, a professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, studied commissions created by the city of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. `` The term I would use for some of them is the politics of avoidance, that if the governing body does n't want to deal with a particularly sensitive problem itself, it will create a board or commission or task force and pass the heat, so to speak,'' <PERSON> Pisciotte </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Pisciotte </PERSON> studied the phenomenon in his own back yard, he thinks his conclusions also would apply to many federal commissions. `` I think the pay commission was a prime example that was too politically sensitive, too politically difficult ... so the people who were ultimately responsible for that passed the heat,'' he said. As to why some commissions produce more results than others, experts say there is no single answer. One of the most successful commissions in recent years was the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, created by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981, which prepared the blueprint for a Social Security rescue bill that barreled through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a matter of weeks. Contrasting this with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that made the deficit study, <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> said: `` The difference was that the environment for a compromise solution on Social Security was hospitable. They really felt that they needed some mechanism to come together with a compromise package.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash amid considerable speculation that it would recommend some kind of tax increase. By the time it wound up its work, the market had rebounded and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had criticized the panel during the campaign and vowed to continue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to any tax hike, was president. `` The only reason that thing was appointed was that you had President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who talked a great game and did some wonderful things for the country, but added a trillion dollars of debt because he basically was a compromiser and he did n't want to use the veto,'' said one Republican who has served on a number of government commissions. He spoke on the understanding his name not be used. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes a legal requirement that the commission's meetings be public added to its difficulties. `` To the extent that partisanship is a major variable, I think that open hearings become a real problem, because if you make any kind of tactical concession it can be interpreted by your rivals within the party as giving away something,'' <PERSON> Janda </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, president of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Morrison-Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> heavy construction firm, who served on the equally politically charged and equally open pay commission, said, `` I personally believe that open meetings are OK. I think they serve a useful purpose.'' The Commission on Executive, <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salaries </ORGANIZATION>, which came up with the 50 percent pay hike that lawmakers turned down in the face of a public uproar, was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1967. It is commonly called the quadrennial commission because it makes its recommendations every four years. In 1981, the commission recommended a 22 percent pay hike and outgoing President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> approved it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given his unofficial approval before taking office, but later changed his mind and withdrew his OK. In 1985, the commission's recommendations did result in a raise, bringing congressional salaries to $ 75,100 a year. Members of the current commission still defend their recommendations, although <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, a former postmaster general, conceded that `` maybe the 50 percent was a little high.'' `` We thought the administration was going to massage it a little, which they did n't, `` <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said. `` That was a calculation on our part.'' Under the law, the president can disapprove a recommended increase or approve it either in whole or in part. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, still in office when the commission made its report, approved it in full. The ethics panel was launched by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in January with instructions to come up with standards `` equitable across all three branches of the federal government.'' It decided, however, that the basic law that prevents executive officials from taking government actions affecting their financial interests could not be applied to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for constitutional and other reasons. In addition, it was unable to decide what categories of work should be exempt from limits on outside earnings. So the panel recommended that such determinations be left up to the president. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., chief architect of an ethics bill vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year, denounced this as `` just a terrible idea. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolsey </PERSON>, former counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the ethics panel, said, `` The current commission had to work very quickly because we were asked to get the job done essentially in a month, and I think given that deadline, did a rather strikingly complete job.''

<HEAD>GAO Study Finds Financial Management Reforms Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s implementation of financial management reforms called for in a two-year law reorganizing the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been inadequate, according to a report released Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, found that although the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has consolidated its financial management structure, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has made few changes and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> violated the law. The <ORGANIZATION> Goldwater-Nichols </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Reorganization Act of 1986 required that the military departments designate a single office within their civilian secretariats to conduct financial management, which includes budgeting, accounting, cash management, financial reporting, internal control and review. `` Offices within the military department secretariats and military headquarters that parallel or duplicate these functions are to be merged into a solitary office located within the civilian secretariat,'' said Rep. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study determined whether the departments' reorganizations satisfied the law and what effects the streamlining had on civilian control. `` Although the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has met the law's requirements, questions over <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> compliance remain, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, though complying in principle, violated the spirit of the law,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, according to the report, merged the office of the comptroller into the office of the assistant secretary for financial management. The authority of the civilian assistant secretary was enhanced and the staff increased from 29 to about 220. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found significant reliance on `` dual-hatting'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and also discovered that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiscal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> handled financial management. The division reports to the commandant, thus violating the law's requirment that financial management be handled by a civilian secretariat. At the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the responsibility of financial management was consolidated within the secretariat but at the same time the position of civilian assistant secretary was eliminated and the job of military comptroller was established. The comptroller was then transferred from the secretariat to the Air Staff. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> turned the law on its head,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` Instead of strengthening civilian control, it bent the law by giving authority for financial management to a three-star general.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in response to the report, noted that the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has more direct control over financial management than ever before. The reorganization act was named after its chief sponsors, former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and the late Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala

<HEAD>Despite Cuomo's Stance, New York May Be On Verge Of A Death Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state introduced the electric chair to the world in 1890 and may be on the verge of commemorating the centennial by putting it back into use after more than 25 years without legal executions. `` Even the White House is interested,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON>, an upstate Republican who is chief sponsor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s death penalty legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Last week, after more than five hours of emotional debate, the Democrat-controlled Assembly approved a death penalty bill, 97-48. Of the five legislators who did not vote, two have voted for the death penalty in the past and the other three have voted against it. That means the 150-member Assembly is within one vote of being able to override a certain veto by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, which requires a two-thirds vote in each house _ that is, 100 votes in the Assembly. `` I think one of them will blink,'' predicted <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, of the 51 opponents. The Republican-controlled state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has voted to override <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s vetoes of the death penalty since 1985 and is expected to do so again this year. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, whose vetoes have stood for each of the past six years, has vowed to `` make my case over and over again'' against the death penalty in the next few months. Before <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> delivered six years of vetoes. But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> acknowledged: `` it's a difficult message. People are angry and disgusted.'' The violence brought by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s crack epidemic has greatly increased public outcry for a death penalty in the state, the nation's largest without capital punishment on the books. There were 1,586 murders in the city last year through Oct. 31, compared with 1,691 in all of 1987. Statewide, <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said during the Assembly debate, there were 2,225 murders last year, up more than 10 percent from 1987. Two weeks ago, a federal drug agent was gunned down in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. And three men are on trial for the murder last year of Police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was guarding the house of a witness in a drug case. Prosecutors say the hit was ordered by a jailed drug kingpin. During last year's presidential campaign, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s father gave his son's badge to pro-death penalty Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Such carnage, plus a poll showing 73 percent of his constituents favored the death penalty, prompted one long-time Assembly opponent, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, to switch his vote last week. His represents a district in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough where <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was killed. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is one of 13 states without an operative death penalty statute. Of the 37 with death penalty laws, only 13 have held executions since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for them to resume in 1976; most of the others may have death sentences pending on appeal. The bill being considered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would allow the death penalty to be used against several types of murderers, including contract killers and those who murder a police officer. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s electric chair was last used on Aug. 15, 1963, when <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, convicted of a 1961 bar shooting, became the 695th person to die in it. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> said he's been getting calls from all over the nation about the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> situation. He said the White House asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office for information about the Assembly vote. Legislators say they can already feel pressure building. `` I've already gotten calls from two police officers and a detective,'' <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democrat who opposes the death penalty, said the day after last week's vote. `` The next few weeks will be very rough,'' said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. `` People have talked about this being the time to take a vacation or move away.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said he expects to vote again against the death penalty, but he does n't flatly rule out a change of heart. `` If my district substantially lobbied me -LRB- in favor of the death penalty bill -RRB-, ... then I would have to look at it,'' he said.

<HEAD>High Mercury Levels In Glades Fish Alarm, Puzzle Experts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Everglades game fish are suddenly showing mercury levels among the highest ever recorded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, alarming experts who are searching for a cause. Last week, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> issued health warnings against eating largemouth bass and warmouth caught in western parts of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> counties. Fish samples contained up to 4.4 parts per million _ more than four times the amount of methyl mercury that the federal government considers safe. The <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> mercury is attracting attention because the precious environment there is already reeling. `` That's one of the highest concentrations ever recorded in the country,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Itri </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> expert on mercury. To find concentration up to 5 or 6 parts per million in fish, he said, he had to go back to 1970, and that was in a lake contaminated by hundreds of pounds of mercury from a factory. New tests have been ordered all over southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the wake of the unexpected findings. Scientists are puzzled by the discovery of methyl mercury in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. While the poisonous metal has been found frequently in the heavily industrialized <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, it has n't been found much in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s rural swampland. Mercury, which is especially dangerous to an unborn fetus, can cause central nervous system damage that leads to deafness, numbness, reduced vision, loss of coordination and trembling. Eating enough <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> fish to cause such damage would take months, but over a long enough time, poisoning would show its effects. There are many theories on how the metal entered the environment, according to scientists. Winds from other regions could have blown mercury-laden factory smoke from as far away as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Or midnight dumpers could have thrown residue from some electronic manufacturer secretly into the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Another theory holds that fire, drought and rain could combine to leech the heavy metal from naturally occurring deposits in the soil. Some scientists lean toward a theory that the contaminant has lain in the muck at the bottom of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> since before mercury was banned from pesticides two decades ago. `` This may have been something that has been down here for 20 years or so,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggle </PERSON>. `` It has been that long since there was a legal fungicide using mercury.'' The likely sources would have been the sugar-cane fields that dot the area. <PERSON> Briggle </PERSON> speculates that the recent drought and water shortages have forced the water district to move water around inside the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, disturbing the mercury-laden muck at the bottom of canals. Once the mercury was back in the water, it entered the food chain and was concentrated in the bass and warmouth predators at the top. <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, has doubts about the old fungicide theory, however. He notes the pattern of the findings _ none have been found north of the agricultural areas in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> _ suggest the contamination began more recently at a specific point or points. In addition, while the drought is serious, other years have been as bad. Yet as recently as three years ago, fish samples showed far lower mercury levels. `` We had some kind of event in the last three years that has put a lot of mercury into the system,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` Something happened at the north end of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and traveled south.'' Contamination from agriculture is one possibility. Another, he said, is the illegal dumping by someone using nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 27. `` There's no telling what's in those canals,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. Although the fish show no ill effects, and people have now been warned against eating them, there still may be victims, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Several animals, including otters, raccoons and such endangered species as <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> mink, wood storks and snail kites, could be at risk from mercury in the fish they eat or in other prey.

 Afghan guerrillas fired 3,000 rockets Sunday on the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, but government troops repelled the onslaught and killed at least 380 attackers, according to <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> and Soviet news reports. Guerrilla reports said 45 to 90 insurgents died in the battle for the city, the target of some of the heaviest fighting in the decade-long Afghan civil war. Soviet television reported that the Afghan army claimed 14,000 guerrillas backed by 3,000 Pakistani advisers took part in the attack. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said 386 guerrillas and 36 `` foreign advisers'' were killed. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 380 guerrillas and 11 Afghan soldiers were killed. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said civilian and government casualties from the rocketing were slight. It gave no total count. The broadcast said two Pakistani helicopters landed outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on Saturday and unloaded weapons and `` foreign advisers'' before heading back home. Official spokesmen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have denied sending their nationals to the country, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistani-backed Moslem guerrillas are battling a communist government The Soviet television report, based on an Afghan army news conference, said <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was not out of danger even though the attack had been turned back. `` Judging by everything, the Pakistani military circles, which sent more than 3,000 of their advisers here, will try to do everything in their power to capture <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>,'' it said. Also Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported that Afghan guerrillas fired on Soviet border guards in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>. The newspaper claimed the culprits were connected with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but it did not say when the incident occurred or if anyone was injured. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended nine years of military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, when the last of its 115,000 soldiers who had been sent into the country left. That left the Afghan government alone to fight the guerrillas, who have vowed to take power. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city and is 40 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, on the main highway between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Afghan capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrillas say the city's fall will signal the early demise of the ruling communists. Thousands of the guerrillas have been moving toward <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to join the offensive. The Afghan government says 3,100 guerrillas have died in fighting around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, according to Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Much of the fighting has been concentrated around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s airport, which guerrilla sources say remains in government hands Before fighting began, guerrillas warned civilians and government militia troops living in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> of the offensive and urged them to evacuate, said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoaib </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group. Western journalists returning to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> said residents have started to evacuate the city. Reports from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> quoted one aid worker as saying as many as 15,000 Afghans were on the move, most of them on foot and taking their livestock with them, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. A moderate rebel group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> said it captured 500 Afghan soldiers and officers from the key garrison of <LOCATION> Samarkhiel </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Some were paraded before journalists Sunday at a rebel camp outside <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has carried out its first airlift of food to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since the withdrawal of Soviet troops. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified Afghan spokesman as saying two Soviet transport planes took in 10 tons of flour each. Also Sunday, the guerrillas' <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said guerrillas shot down a government fighter jet, killing everyone aboard. It gave no further details and there was no way to independently confirm the report.

<HEAD>Christians and Druse Battle; Beirut Airport Shut Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian army troops and Syrian-backed Druse militiamen battled fiercely Sunday in hills above <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a day after authorities shut down <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s only international airport. A police spokesman said the clashes erupted in the evening in and around the strategic hilltop town of Souk El-Gharb. The violence broke a cease-fire called at midnight Saturday to halt the worst fighting around the capital in two years. There was no immediate word on casualties from Sunday's artillery and rocket duels between Christian units and militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. Six people have been killed and 32 wounded since clashes broke out Wednesday. On Saturday, after Druse militiamen shelled the city's port and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> compound, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ordered <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport closed, saying it was unsafe. The order came as a rebuff to <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, the public works and tourism minister in the rival Moslem Cabinet. He had vowed to keep the airport operating. In retaliation, the Moslem Cabinet moved Sunday to block sea traffic to Christian-controlled harbors. `` Because of escalating hostilities, maritime traffic to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port and the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> is henceforth declared unsafe,'' said a statement issued by the Moslem administration. There was no immediate indication of what measures were planned to blockade the ports. The Moslems have no naval force but could launch long-range artillery attacks on <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, which is 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the main port in the Christian heartland. Directors of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlines </LOCATION>, the state carrier, suspended flights indefinitely after a five-hour meeting Sunday at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. Hundreds of mostly Lebanese passengers crowded the airport departure lounge, then returned to the city when the suspension was announced. An airport official who requested anonymity said staff were still reporting for duty because they did not know how long the airport would be closed. `` It's a day-by-day affair,'' he said. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Balkan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> canceled its scheduled flight to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the only regular Sunday international flight to the city, the official said. Syrian, Soviet and Czechoslovakian carriers are the only other foreign airlines that regularly use the airport. Most of Sunday's fighting focused on <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El-Gharb </LOCATION>, a mountain peak 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that commands a network of roads leading from Druse-held territory to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian section. Police said thousands of people huddled in basements and bomb shelters all Saturday night as the battling troops shelled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suburbs and 21 residential districts on both sides of the front lines in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountain range. The fighting has imperiled efforts by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers' committee to resolve a crisis that threatens the country with permanent partition into sectarian cantons. The crisis erupted when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expired Sept. 22 and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was unable to elect a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named the army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, to lead an interim military Cabinet. Moslems and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Palestinian leaders denounced on Sunday new proposals reportedly planned by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for easing tension in the Israeli-occupied territories. The Palestinians, attending a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace symposium in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called on the administration to push instead for a permanent solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, including creation of an independent Palestinian state. Several left-wing Israeli legislators attending the three-day symposium, which began Saturday, also predicted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiatives described in a published report Sunday would fail if they included only interim measures for quelling the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to propose that both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> take steps to ease tension in the Israeli-occupied territories. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials plan to ask <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release some of the Palestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limit detentions and reopen schools in the territories, the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified senior administration official. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiatives also would call on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to halt violent demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories, block anti-Israeli raids from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and stop distribution of inflammatory leaflets, the newspaper said. `` These demands are unbalanced, unfair,'' said <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and a top <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader in the occupied territories. He said the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals were flawed because `` they are asking us to stop the demonstrations,'' while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was being asked `` the minimum.'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials at the symposium said the real issue is ending <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the territories, captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, and creating a Palestinian state. `` The intefadeh -LRB- the Arabic name for the uprising -RRB- is our only weapon for continuing the peace plan,'' said <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaath </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative arm. `` What is not negotiable is the final result: an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Afif </PERSON> <PERSON> Safieh </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said the reported new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals were aimed at the wrong target. `` The target should not be how to decrease the level of tensions, but how to practice, manage and plan the solution to the conflict,'' he said. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals `` show at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency'' about restarting the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace process. But he said if the administration plans only `` an interim agreement,'' without addressing the final status between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the proposals will fail. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzaban </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> member from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> party, said the proposals were incomplete. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` is like the man riding a bicycle,'' he said. `` He can go either forward or backward, but he can not stand still because he will fall down. So we must push the peace process forward.'' The new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals will be presented Monday when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> meets with the president, the Times reported, while the suggestions for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will be presented through the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The three-day symposium at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is the first to be sponsored by Israelis and Palestinians in cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews and Arabs.

<HEAD>Adjustment Will Be Worse For Non-Union Eastern Workers _ Psychologists</HEAD>

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees have the psychological benefit of venting their feeling while picketing, but non-union workers who found themselves out of work overnight will have a tougher time adjusting, psychologists say. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, an organizational psychologist who helps major companies through mergers and cutbacks, said he has been impressed by the commitment of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions to the 60-year-old carrier. `` Eastern means something to them,'' said Marks, a consultant in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office of <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. `` I am impressed by the extent in which people want to buy into their company psychologically.'' The union's tactic of focusing attention on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as the bad guy in the strike that virtually grounded the Miami-based airline is beneficial for the employees, he said. `` What's fascinating about this case is it really comes down -LRB- to -RRB- a personality battle. You do n't hear people talking about the economics of the situation,'' he said. `` That's part of the reason they're rebelling against <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and not Eastern. It's this raider <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> who would come in and try to break them.'' But all Eastern employees must face the changes that in less than a week landed the nation's seventh-largest airline in bankruptcy court. `` You lose all sense of control,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> psychology professor. `` But in a way they're sustained by the fact they have a common opponent -LRB- Lorenzo -RRB- People have been known to endure five years of bombing under those circumstances.'' Since many Eastern employees have long service with the carrier, `` they have to make almost a midlife, midcareer transition, which is very, very difficult,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, an associate professor of labor relations at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> school of business. An employee's standard of living `` gets cut drastically and they're eating hot dogs. ... You're going from a very high standard of living to one that's very low,'' he said. About 9,500 of the company's non-union workers ended up in the worst psychological position of all when they were laid off without notice last week, but some experts believe they will have an easier time finding work because they have more flexible skills than the pilots, machinists and flight attendants trained for a single job. Marks suggested group discussion sessions for non-union workers to vent their feelings, an avenue union members have at the union hall and on picket lines. Eastern workers will go through stages of denial, expecting the strike to be over soon, to anger against <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and the strikers, to planning strategy about staying with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and job hunting, to `` acceptance, and you've got to go through those stages,'' <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> expects a transition time of six months to a year while people find new jobs. He and Marks likened the strike to recent mergers and corporate cutbacks because of the similar labor adjustments. `` If you have a massive downsizing, you're truly changing the organization. It can not not change,'' said <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, who acted as a consultant as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> absorbed <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and helped with the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> corporation. `` There's a myth that some managers hold -LRB- that -RRB- the people will be grateful that they survived,'' he said. `` But that's the farthest from the truth because ... they're waiting for the other shoe to drop.'' Marks believes corporations have responsibility to help their employees to adjust and employees need to take greater control of their lives. `` The lesson to be learned for all employees is you've got to be more responsible, to be more alert to what changes will come down the pike,'' he said. `` The lesson to be learned by employers is to send a message that their people matter.''

<HEAD>President Says He Is Healthy Again, Hopes To Quell Power Struggle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> denied Sunday that he is involved in a power struggle with his heir apparent, and he said he is ready to resume work following a stroke. In his first televised remarks since his Jan. 18 stroke, the 73-year-old <PERSON> Afrikaner </PERSON> said he has a constitutional duty to continue in office. He made no reference to calls for him to step down when he spoke in a 15-minute, prerecorded interview on state television network's evening news show Two weeks after his Jan. 18 stroke, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and was succeeded by Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 52. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and other senior Nationalist leaders met <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last week amid reports a solid majority of the party's parliamentary caucus wants <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to retire promptly or cede a significant share of power to de Klerk. More talks are expected this week. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who showed no signs of ill-health during the interview, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` was being misused by some people,'' but insisted there is no personal conflict. `` That would be a terrible charge against he and I,'' said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, noting he appointed de Klerk to key parliamentary posts in past years. `` Why? Because I have faith in him,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. He indicated he was displeased with suggestions a de Klerk presidency would herald a new era of political reform. `` I originated the concept of reform,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has always shared these sentiments with me,'' he added. `` There are forces in this country seeking to exploit an unfortunate situation to sow political confusion.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said even before his stroke, he advocated steps to lighten the presidential workload. But he gave no hint when he might retire from the post he has held since 1978. He said it was too early to say when he might call a general election, which must be held within 12 months. `` I am healthy now,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` I want to talk to fellow Cabinet members. I want to talk to leaders of other population groups on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s future.'' `` I'm not looking for power for the sake of power ... I'm open to advice,'' he said. Near the end of his interview, he summed up his basic message: `` Stay calm _ we're living in dangerous times, in difficult times. The Botha-de Klerk confrontation was front-page news in all major newspapers Sunday. `` Botha the Defiant,'' said a banner headline in the Sunday Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper. `` P.W. Stands Alone,'' said the Sunday Star. `` Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s attitude is quite irrational,'' said a Star editorial. `` The real interests of this country ... are certainly more crucial than the quirks of a fading strong man reluctant to let go of power.''

 Cafeterias at the nation's second-largest school district will stop serving apples to students this week in response to a report finding a cancer risk to children from a chemical residue on some fruit. The ban also includes any apple products, including juice, pies and applesauce, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District officials. The district's 592,000 students have eaten more than 5 million apples each year, second only to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school system, where students consumed 13 million apples. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> schools enacted a similar ban last week. `` That's a lot of apples, so we decided to do it in order to protect the health and safety of students,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district spokeswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Hain </PERSON>. The bans in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> followed a Feb. 28 report by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which said the chemical daminozide could increase the incidence of cancer in children. Daminozide, sold under the brand name Alar, is sprayed on apple trees in the spring and acts to keep apples on the tree longer. That makes harvesting easier, improves the apples' color and firmness, and extends their shelf life. Alar permeates the fruit's skin and can not be peeled off or washed away. Apple growers have criticized the report, contending that only 4 percent of the apples sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show any traces of Alar and that those traces fall well below federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> levels. `` It's very disturbing that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would arbitrarily make a decision to ban apples based on the results of one report in which the facts are not right,'' said <PERSON> Derl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, president of the Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade organization for the $ 1.2 billion-a-year industry. `` An apple a day is still healthy advice,'' <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> said. The federal <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has moved to ban Alar eventually, but has said it disagrees with the environmental group's contention that the risk from using it is so great that an immediate ban is needed. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the group's study. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> school district will not serve apples or apple products until it conducts its own laboratory tests, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenberg </PERSON>, deputy director of food services for the district. `` We are taking a cautious approach to a problem that could affect the health of our schoolchildren,'' he said.

 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, his popularity at a new low, would lose at every level of a mayoral election, and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> would win, according to a poll released Sunday.

Six months before the primary, 50 percent of those polled disapproved of how the three-term mayor does his job, up five points in three months. Thirty-one percent approved of the mayor's performance, down from 37 percent in December Sunday's poll showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> leading a four-way Democratic primary against <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and real estate developer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON>.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Measure for Measure' Opens at Lincoln Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 `` Measure for Measure,'' the darkest of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s comedies, deals with sexual hypocrisy, political intrigue and urban lawlessness. In other words, a perfect play for our times, a fact reinforced by the clear, concise, modern-dress production that opened last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Mitzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. The director is <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, artistic head of the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> built his regional theater reputation in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on a series of dazzling interpretations of Shakespeare including a debonair, 1930-ish `` Twelfth Night,'' a surrealistic and phantasmagorical `` Pericles'' and a lavish `` Hamlet,'' starring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The latter looked like a series of staged photo opportunities for the evening news. His `` Measure for Measure'' is more austere, almost antiseptic in design and execution. Designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>'s minimalist environment consists of a white, graffiti-covered wall, a naked light bulb hanging over the stage and a few pieces of what looks like secondhand office furniture. A sense of dislocation prevails. Although the setting is <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, it could be anywhere. An actor reads a German-language newspaper, but the graffiti on the wall is in English. The costumes, also by <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>, are a mixture of Madison Avenue conservative and <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> chic. For a comedy, `` Measure for Measure'' mostly stays somber until the end of the evening. Until then, audiences have to deal with the machinations of the <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> who leaves his kingdom in the hands of <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, a self-righteous bureaucrat. When <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> orders <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> to be executed for his sexual escapades, he does n't realize he will fall in love with the condemned man's sister <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> offers a reprieve in exchange for sexual favors from the woman. It takes the Duke, disguised as a friar, quite a while to straighten out the mess. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON>'s paternal portrayal of the Duke is fine, but his speaking voice is odd, slow and measured as if he were reciting a foreign language lesson. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, looking like a young, eager Wall Street lawyer, projects the coldness of the ambitious <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> as well as his frantic desire when the man realizes that he wants <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitford </PERSON> projects the passion of a young man afraid to die. A sweet-faced <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> makes a forthright heroine, particularly when she is standing up to <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s lechery. She's also beguiling as she gradually realizes she is falling in love with the Duke. Their embrace at the end of the play is a triumph of the romantic spirit that, until then, has been overshadowed by lust. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> minimizes the comic characters here, but there are some expert comic cameos by <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as a blowzy, aging prostitute and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> as <PERSON> Pompey </PERSON>, that experienced bawd turned apprentice executioner. <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> seems as comfortable and proficient with <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> as he does with television sitcom, a remarkable accomplishment. Several of the minor characters are at odds with <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>' unfussy direction particularly <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> as an overly mannered pimp and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> as a grating, one-note policeman. `` Measure for Measure'' always has been called one of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s problem plays because of its juxiposition of comedy and tragedy. Both are very near the surface of this dissection of sexual and governmental power. It's to the credit of the director and his fine cast that the right balance has been found between the two.

 Devout Roman Catholics, inspired by the visions of a pipefitter from suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and the curious gathered in a vegetable field near this tiny southeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> town Sunday, hoping to see the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Some of the estimated 3,000 people present said they did indeed see what they came to see. `` I believe that I saw her, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and the angels and the saints,'' said <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, 28, from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>. `` I'm kind of nervous and overwhelmed.'' Some took pictures of the sun with instant cameras and pointed to the splotchy, multicolored images as evidence that holy apparitions had appeared. `` See, here's the Blessed Mother,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Deroche </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Luling </LOCATION> as she pointed to a photograph she had taken. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> also held photos, taken earlier in the day, of what she said were the gates of heaven. `` I'm expecting a miracle. I'm blind in this eye and I have glaucoma in the other. My nephew is crippled and my uncle has cancer,'' she said, beginning to sob. `` It may not be for me, but I believe in my heart. You have to believe for a miracle.'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimondo </PERSON>, 52, is the man whose tales of miraculous visions sparked the huge turnout at <LOCATION> Tickfaw </LOCATION>. A few weeks ago, the Tunisian native, now a pipefitter from <LOCATION> Chalmette </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> had appeared to him recently and told him to go to <LOCATION> Tickfaw </LOCATION> to honor St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. <PERSON> Raimondo </PERSON> stayed sequestered in a mobile home on the edge of the vegetable field early Sunday, but later emerged and began wandering among the faithful, many of whom reached out to touch him as he ambled through the crowd. `` I'm very happy,'' he said `` We're letting <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> show us the way. There are a lot of people here.'' Not everyone was sure a miracle would happen. `` We wanted to see what was going to happen. We're going to Mass here and anything else is extra,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>. Outside <PERSON> Raimondo </PERSON>'s trailer, families with lawn chairs and coolers ate picnic lunches in the 80 degree sunshine, while someone led <ORGANIZATION> Hail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> prayers over a loudspeaker. Women knelt in muddy ruts among the cabbages and onions saying prayers. Some had floral crosses by their sides. Others knelt before a St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s altar heaped with food, flowers and a picture of the Last Supper. A large wooden cross had been erected in the field by <PERSON> Raimondo </PERSON>. A spokesman for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> did not immediately return a telephone call Sunday seeking comment on the vision reports. Last summer, about 12,000 people gathered for a Mass on the grounds of a charismatic church in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where three parishioners claimed to receive messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The three parishioners said they began receiving messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> arlier in the summer, shortly after they returned from a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Medugorje </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where six youths claim they have seen apparitions of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> since 1981.

 A police officer was shot to death when he pulled over a man for speeding and then tried to arrest him on an outstanding traffic ticket, authorities said. Patrolman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON>, 29, a six-year veteran of the force in this <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> suburb, was shot in the back of the head early Saturday.

Police said they arrested <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 34, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> insurance salesman, about 45 minutes after the shooting. Investigators said <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON> had stopped the driver of a Mercury for speeding and ran a routine warrant check on the man's driver's license After learning the driver had an outstanding <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> traffic citation, <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON> returned to the Mercury and tried to arrest the driver. Police on duty during the weekend would not give details on the citation. A scuffle ensued and <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON> was shot in the back of the head with a small-caliber weapon, officers said. `` He was one you do n't expect something like this to happen because he's cautious, he's good,'' said <LOCATION> Balcones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> emergency dispatcher <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeffner </PERSON>. When officers discovered <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON>, his service revolver was still in his holster and the driver's license belonging to the motorist was tucked into his gun belt, the Light reported. Officers later found <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> hiding in a wooded area near the residence listed on the driver's license. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who reportedly had no previous criminal record, was being held on attempted capital murder charges in lieu of $ 1 million bail. Officials said the charge would be upgraded to capital murder because of the death of <PERSON> Rogiers </PERSON>, who had a 2-year-old son.

<HEAD>Far Right Party Gains Seats, Kohl's Party Loses Control in Frankfurt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>

 An extreme rightist party won seven City Council seats in municipal elections Sunday that dealt a crushing defeat to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Christian Democrats. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took 6.6 percent of the vote, according to preliminary results, winning representation in city government for the first time since 1968. In January, another far-right party, the Republicans, won seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature. Both parties want to sharply reduce the number of foreigners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and their success marks a major shift to the right among a growing number of voters. About two hours after the preliminary results of the vote became known, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall against the National Democrats. Police reported no incidents. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservatives suffered heavy losses in other municipalities in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state, but their worst rout came in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where they had governed alone since 1977. Preliminary results from the official state voting office, based on computer projections, gave the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 36.6 percent of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> vote. That dropped their representation in city government from 48 to 36 seats. The leftist Social Democrats, the mainstream opposition party, won 40.1 percent and 40 seats, up from 37 seats won after 1985 elections. The anti-NATO Greens won 10.1 percent and 10 seats, up from eight previously. The National Democrats did not run in the 1985 elections. The outcome ousted <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brueck </PERSON>, who will be replaced by Social Democrat <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauff </PERSON>, a 48-year-old former federal transport minister. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> also scored major gains in the rest of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state, where 4.1 million voters were eligible to vote. The Social Democrats were projected to score moderate statewide gains. The National Democrats campaigned hard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> against the large number of foreigners in the city. With 148,000 foreigners _ 25 percent of its population _ <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> has the largest proportion of foreigners of West German cities. The issue was used by the Republicans in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections on Jan. 29. The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote and 11 seats in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s legislature. The rightists were projected to score minor gains outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedmann </PERSON>, a Jewish community leader and a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> gains will have `` serious consequences.'' `` This is the worst result of the election,'' <PERSON> Friedmann </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> state television. `` This will damage <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s reputation abroad.'' The outcome in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> appeared to pave the way for a leftist coalition in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> between the Social Democrats and the Greens. A similar coalition is expected to start governing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> next week after an agreement between the Social Democrats and the Alternative List, a leftist party similar to the Greens.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer has accused a district attorney of making him a target of an undercover operation to coerce him into working against his own clients, in a case his supporters say could endanger attorney-client relations. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>, 43, who faces criminal charges in connection with the case, has filed notice he plans to sue 6th Judicial District Attorney <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> set up the undercover operation with the intent of trapping <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> and forcing him to betray his own clients. <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddon </PERSON>, says the case threatens the country's adversarial system of justice `` because a defendant has to be able to believe his own lawyer is n't working for the DA. He was charged last month with theft by receiving and of possession a dangerous weapon. He said it was because he had rejected <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>'s threats. He faces trial May 22 in <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> and could get up to eight years in prison and lose his law license if convicted. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> has declined to comment on the case against <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>, which he has turned over to a special prosecutor from another district, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>'s complaint, local law enforcement officials assigned a deputy sheriff, Brent Pace, to pose as a criminal defendant named `` Colton Young'' and approach <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> for legal help. A false charge and phony affidavit were filed in court to make it appear that `` Young'' really was in legal trouble. The officials supplied Pace with $ 500 in public money to pay half of <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>'s fee, the complaint said. After <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> won dismissal of the misdemeanor charges against Pace, Pace offered to pay the remaining $ 500 in legal fees in drugs, and when <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> refused, Pace offered him guns. <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> said he eventually agreed to keep an Uzi machine gun as collateral on the balance Pace owed, and he was immediately arrested. He contends <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> and Police Sergeant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> offered him a deal in which no charges would be filed if <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> agreed to `` set up'' three of his clients for <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> refused and <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> filed the weapons charges, the complaint said. Cross, the special prosecutor, would not comment on the case. But in a preliminary hearing, he said that <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> believed the gun Pace had given him was stolen because that's what Pace had said. He also said <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> knew the weapon had been altered to make it an illegal, automatic weapon, which <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> disputes. Two lawyers were among 15 people, several of them locally prominent, who signed a public letter questioning <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>'s treatment of <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> Attorney <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON>, one of the signers, said the case `` goes to the very basis of the attorney-client relationship. It's just not right and that's why I signed the letter.'' <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddon </PERSON>, made a similar point, saying: `` What stinks to me is setting up the defense bar and turning them against their own clients. It destroys people's faith. You'd wonder if your lawyer is working for the police.'' <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>'s notice of intent to sue, filed Feb. 14, said he will seek at least $ 1 million, plus punitive damages, for damage to his reputation, cost of his defense and loss of earning capacity. Named along with <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> are the sheriff and police department in <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, the city council, county commission and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>.

 Israeli soldiers on Sunday killed two Palestinian guerrillas who entered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on a mission to infiltrate the Jewish state. The incident was likely to increase Israeli demands that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halt its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a Palestinian stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and soldiers broke up a funeral for a 17-year-old Palestinian who died Sunday of wounds suffered in a clash the previous day. The soldier was reported in fair condition and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said his attacker was captured after being shot three times with rubber bullets. Radio reports said the soldier was stabbed with a kitchen knife as troops ordered youths to erase anti-Israeli graffiti and take down outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> man who died was identified as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrain </PERSON> of the Aida refugee camp. Witnesses said soldiers blocked off the camp and fired tear gas and rubber bullets to block his funeral. The army confirmed the death and said it placed a curfew on the camp. At least 395 Palestinians and 17 Israelis been killed during the 15-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army sealed with concrete the home of a Palestinian who stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier Sunday in the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> news reports said. An army spokesman said the alleged assailant was caught and confessed to the stabbing. The sealing or demolition of homes is routine punishment for suspects in such attacks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the punishment as a deterrent to future perpetrators. At least 12 Palestinians were reported wounded Sunday in clashes with soldiers throughout the occupied territories. The army confirmed eight of the injuries. The fighting in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> erupted when two armed guerrillas were spotted on the edge of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security zone near <LOCATION> Hasbaya </LOCATION>, about five miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border. No Israeli troops were injured, Israeli military officials said. The radical Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement issued at <LOCATION> Rashaya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the guerrillas were among a group sent on a military operation into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The others escaped, said a group spokesman, who insisted on anonymity. The confrontation was the third between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in less than three weeks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> cited the two earlier encounters in calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to call off its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains the fighting in the security zone is evidence that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is violating his pledge to give up terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s pledge was behind the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement in December to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established the six - by 10-mile wide zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to protect its northern border when it pulled most of its forces out of the region in 1985, ending a three-year occupation <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, meanwhile, was quoted Sunday as saying he is willing to go to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to convince <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders to agree to an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. But he said he would only do so with the agreement of other Arab states. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke in an interview with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He has made similar statements in the past. Also Sunday, the army said a colonel had been suspended from his post for allegedly stealing a wristwatch off the body of a dead guerrilla. The colonel was identified only as `` Col. R.,'' and the spokesman said he was an `` experienced and a veteran fighter.'' He was suspended from his post pending clarification of the legal ramifications of the incident, the spokesman said.

 Four Scottish constables arrived Sunday to calm families who say they ca n't put to rest loved ones killed by a terrorist bomb on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 until the victims' personal belongings are returned to them. The senior police officers wanted to ease the pain and confusion felt by many families of the 259 victims whose possessions have been withheld during the investigation of the Dec. 21 plane explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Assistant Chief Constable <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said he and his fellow officers also wanted to quell rumors. `` We got the feeling there was a great deal of misinformation about what we were doing with the personal items,'' <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said. `` We came to tell the relatives the truth right from the horse's mouth. More than 100 people gathered in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to hear the constables' reassurances that many of the victims' personal belongings would be returned and to examine maps of the rugged terrain where the victims' bodies were found `` It's a very traumatic thing for us,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, whose brother-in-law was on Flight 103. `` You run the gamut of emotions, reliving the whole thing.'' <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said the grieving families `` ca n't complete the healing process until those possessions are returned.'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, who lost one of his 20-year-old twin daughters in the bombing, said he and his wife came from their home in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to try to make some sense of the tragedy. `` It's a step,'' he said. `` I'm not sure where it's taking us but it's a step.'' <PERSON> Jeanine </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulanger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> said that because officials had not recovered her 21-year-old daughter's body, she had pinned all her hopes on retrieving some of the college student's possessions. `` She was an actress, a singer, a dancer and a poet,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Boulanger </PERSON> said. `` These items, her journal, they're the only tangible things we have to hold on to.'' <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> flatly denied rumors that investigators had destroyed victims' property. `` Nothing but nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. `` But we want to make sure to clarify that for people ... who right now have nothing.'' Police have found and catalogued more than 11,000 items strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside. But even though ownership has been established and the property has been eliminated from the criminal inquiry, most families are still waiting. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said the first property was returned in mid-February via the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and that the process was continuing. In addition to those on board, 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> were killed when the wreckage of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 fell to the ground after an explosion. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Investigators have traced the bomb to a portable radio packed with the luggage, but have not yet established what person or group was responsible. The Scottish officers also met over the weekend with about 120 families in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They were scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Monday and <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on Tuesday before returning home.

<HEAD>Report Police Increase Security for Leading Britons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have increased security around leading figures following reports of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> assassination squad at large in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and a list of prominent people found at a bomb-making site in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. The domestic news agency says police think the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unit, identified by Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> on Wednesday, may be working from a list of political and public figures similar to one found Dec. 21 in a south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb factory. `` We can confirm that a number of names of people prominent in public life in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were found on a list in the house in <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> in December,'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said Saturday. `` Each individual named has been given suitable security advice.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard did not disclose who was on the list found in <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> nor say how many names it contained. The discovery of a cache of Semtex explosive and firearms in woods near the northern coastal resort of Scarborough on Tuesday as well as 22 pounds of the explosive in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reservoir led the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Terrorist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION> to issue the warnings to leading figures, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and senior Cabinet ministers are to address a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>'s Crown Hotel on Friday. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard never discusses the security of individuals or reveals details of any armed escorts. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, however, said it understood that a number of people thought to be on the list have been given round-the-clock protection. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has been waging a violent campaign to drive the British out of the largely <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the predominantly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said a small gang equipped with explosives and guns was at large in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government and security services say the unit might be planning a bombing campaign on the British mainland. The group is thought to have been responsible for the Aug. 1 bomb blast at army barracks at <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which killed one soldier and injured nine, and another blast at <LOCATION> Ternhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, Feb. 20. Only one soldier was injured in that bombing.

 One of just two known sets of the records of one of the last chapters of World War II is slowly falling apart. The brittle, yellowing records include copies of the briefs filed by attorneys in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ a panel of judges from 11 countries who tried <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military and civilian leaders for war crimes. Printed on inexpensive paper and bound by string or paper clips, they sit in two file cabinets in the rare book room of <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Crosby Library. `` The quality of the paper and the printing is such that they will decay over time,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION>'s library director. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, convinced the documents have great historical value, said he is seeking grants to help preserve them. The documents include the indictments and verdicts against 28 Japanese leaders and a 129-page list of atrocities committed against prisoners. They were apparently reproduced on a type of mimeograph machine, using whatever paper was available in war-torn <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> between 1946 and 1948. The only other known copy of the tribunal records is in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, unindexed and reproduced on the same cheap paper. The documents were donated to the university last year by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> attorney whose late father, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, was acting chief prosecutor at the trials' conclusion. The tribunal was the Japanese counterpart of the Nuremburg trials of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> high command. It convicted 25 Japanese leaders, including War Minister <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>, who was ordered executed along with six others. Others were sentenced to prison for life or given long sentences. Although complete records of the 1946 Nuremburg trials have been published, the records of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tribunal have not, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said. `` It's an asset that's priceless,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want anything to happen to it.'' His father, a lawyer, went to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1946 to assist chief prosecutor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, and became acting chief prosecutor when <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> fell ill. When the trials concluded, the elder <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> sent one set of records to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and brought another set home to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. He later gave the set to his son, with instructions they eventually be donated to <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION>, where both <PERSON> Mahoneys </PERSON> attended law school. `` I've read very little, but the little I've read is fascinating,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said he may seek grants to place the documents on microfilm, a project that is tentatively estimated to cost as much as $ 20,000.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Clergy Predict Black-White Church Split Will Persist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s main Afrikaner church is likely to remain estranged from its black and mixed-race counterparts despite its latest and most explicit repudiation of apartheid, two dissident white clergymen said Sunday. <PERSON> Beyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Naude </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, ministers who left the white <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to join its black offspring, wrote newspaper articles suggesting an irrevocable split was likely because of the white church leadership's reluctance to support concrete anti-apartheid action. <PERSON> Naude </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were assessing a five-day conference they attended last week, aimed at finding common ground among the church branches on racial issues. During the conference the white church, to which President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and most of his Cabinet belong, declared apartheid a sin. However, delegates from the white church did not endorse a resolution advocating civil disobedience to oppose apartheid and did not join in a call for the abolition of specific racial segregation laws. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who broke from the white church in 1982 and now is a pastor in a black township, wrote in the Sunday Times that the conference was `` in many ways a dialogue of the deaf.'' `` Those belonging to the world of the oppressor could not hear or understand the cries and anger of those living in the world of the oppressed,'' he wrote. `` The white church was once again exposed as a captive of the Afrikaner volk -LRB- people -RRB- and the Nationalist government.'' <PERSON> Naude </PERSON>, whose split with the white church dates back to the 1960s, wrote in the Sunday Star newspaper that `` the already fragile thread of fellowship may be irrevocably broken'' if whites react unsympathetically to the strong anti-apartheid resolutions adopted by the black and mixed-race delegates. One area of common ground established at the conference was opposition to the 33-month-old state of emergency, during which the government has detained thousands of black activists. Leaders of the white, black and mixed-race churches reportedly plan to make a joint appeal to the government to lift the emergency and halt detention without trial. Sunday was designated by activists across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as National Detainees Day, and church services were held in several communities to express solidarity with those held without charge.

<TEXT>
 Three more large solar flares, each with the potential to disrupt radio transmissions and trigger aurora borealis, have erupted on the sun in a wake of an unusually large blast, researchers say. A blast 36 times the size of Earth that occurred Thursday on the sun's northeast quadrant was possibly the largest ever recorded, researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Holloman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> said. Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkegard </PERSON> said Saturday that the huge eruption of gas from the surface of the sun was followed by another large explosion Friday morning and three more on Saturday. He said the flare Thursday measured a 4-brilliant rating, while the blast Friday measured a 3-brilliant. Flares that are big enough to disrupt radio transmissions are rated by astronomers from zero-brilliant to 4-brilliant, he said. The three blasts that occurred Saturday, also in the northeast quadrant, each rated 2-brilliant, he said. `` That's uncommon _ to have that many big flares in the same region in the same day,'' <PERSON> Kirkegard </PERSON> said. `` It's a very disturbed area _ probably two to three Earths in diameter,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Folkers </PERSON>, a technical specialist and telescope operator at <ORGANIZATION> Kitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Thursday's solar flare extended some 70,000 miles into space, said researchers at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION>, just east of <LOCATION> Holloman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alamogordo </LOCATION> `` The report I got from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Peak ... is it's the largest one they've seen _ ever,'' said astronomer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> at Kitt Peak. `` This is pretty exciting for us up here.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Near Jr., commander of <PERSON> Holloman </PERSON>'s solar observatory in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, said Friday the flare was the size of 36 Earths. The violent eruptions created the potential to disrupt long-range communications on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> _ such as short-wave transmissions and satellite links, researchers said. <PERSON> Folkers </PERSON> said ultraviolet radiation and X-rays hit the Earth's upper atmosphere at noon Thursday, just eight minutes after the solar blast Such radiation travels at the speed of light, he said. Slower-moving particles are expected to pelt the outer atmosphere for days as a result of Thursday's flare, he said. `` What happens when you have a solar flare is that the cosmic particles hit the ionosphere and shatter it,'' <PERSON> Folkers </PERSON> said. The ionosphere, about 120 miles above the Earth's surface, normally acts like a mirror, reflecting radio transmissions back to the surface, said <PERSON> Folkers </PERSON>, who said he studies solar flares as a hobby. After it is disrupted by the solar particles, the ionosphere gradually reassembles and regains its reflective ability, he said. In the meantime, he said, people listening to short-wave broadcasts might notice that stations tend to fade out. He also said there may be more aurora borealis sightings in coming days as the solar particles interact with the earth's magnetic field

 Thousands of pro-democrats demonstrated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> on Sunday, while thousands of Latvians rallied in support of a grass-roots political organization, organizers said. Police arrested about 100 protesters in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> protests, one activist said. The demonstrators in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, estimated at 1,500, unfurled the white, blue and red flag of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> that flew after the February Revolution in 1917, during the eight months of shaky attempts to found a democracy before the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> took over, the activist said. An estimated 200,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital, to express support for the aims of the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has come under fire from a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> nationalist group, one of the protesters said. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the protest in the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital was the biggest protest ever seen in that Soviet republic. Thousands gathered in a downtown square to counter increasing pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Interfront </LOCATION>, a largely Russian organization that has organized at least one strike to protest <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> moves to restore Latvian as the republic's dominant language, <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Some people carried placards calling for Latvian independence and favoring the language law. Participants agreed to send a message to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Latvian parliament favoring democratization, <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said. The rally ended peacefully and no arrests were made, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a fledgling political party in a nation that bans any alternative to the ruling communists, organized the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> demonstrations. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, claims broad-based support and has worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and local authorities to pursue its reform program. The <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> protest, against allegedly undemocratic sections in a new election law, drew 7,000 people and 1,500 police and crowd control officers, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said authorities detained 65 people. About 1,500 people attended the demonstration on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Mayakovsky Square and 40 people were detained, he said It was not clear if charges would be filed. In the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kuibyshev </LOCATION>, 300 people marched 2 miles down city streets Sunday to mark the anniversary of the February revolution, and 100 of them continued the meeting in a factory hall, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. They carried placards with such slogans as, `` Political opposition is the guarantee of democracy.'' The Kuibyshev protest proceeded unhindered after the organizers threatened a group hunger strike and Western media coverage of any repressive measures, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said.

 Embattled Navajo Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> ordered two tribal officials fired and locks on two buildings changed, prompting a predecessor to say Sunday that the move represented `` a police state.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has been under fire since witnesses, including his son, told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> select committee last month that he had taken kickbacks and bribes from companies wanting to do business with the nation's largest Indian tribe. The latest developments came after a meeting Friday by 44 dissident members of the 88-member <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The dissidents elected an interim chairman and vice chairman and placed Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on administrative leave.

Late Friday, tribal police were ordered to change the locks on the council building and the legislative office, said Ms. <PERSON> Rouwalk </PERSON>. Former Tribal Chairman <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> said in an interview Sunday on <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> KFYI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s move was uncalled for and represented another case of `` excessive use of police force on this reservation.'' `` So in essence, the bottom line is we really have a police state here,'' <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> said.

No one could be reached for comment Sunday because tribal offices were closed. Approximately 150,000 of the Navajos' 200,000 members live on the reservation, which includes much of northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> as well as parts of northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 About 2,500 veterans and supporters from nine states marched Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> to demand that officials remove a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag placed on the floor in an art student's exhibit At one point, participants in the most recent of a series of protests attacked about a dozen students holding a counterdemonstration, swinging fists and throwing hot coffee. Police intervened, and no one was injured. A veteran and four students were arrested, said Police Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Halco </PERSON>. The veteran was charged with battery; two students were charged with disorderly conduct and the other two were charged with criminal damage to property for painting flags on the sidewalk in an effort to force demonstrators to walk on the flag, <ORGANIZATION> Halco </ORGANIZATION> said. Police led the students to a corner two blocks away from the demonstrators and surrounded them with barricades. The flag-waving protesters, led by local politicians and leaders of veterans groups, chanted, `` One, two, three, four, get the flag off the floor.'' `` This symbol of our nation, it is sacred. It can not be desecrated,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, organizer of the protest. `` The First Amendment has limits.'' Another group of about 20 counterdemonstrators, primarily artists from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, stood nearby under heavy police guard. They carried empty picture frames on sticks, which they said showed the exhibit being protested was essentially `` empty'' of artistic merit, but that the rights of artists to free expression should be upheld. `` This is a misguided protest,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Casilly </PERSON>, 31, said of the veterans' protest. `` They're trampling all over everything the flag stands for.'' The flag, part of an exhibit of 66 minority artists' work, features the Stars and Stripes positioned in such a way that viewrs are likely to step on it. The work also shows photos of flag-draped coffins and South Koreans burning the flag. Protests began about a week after the exhibit, titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' opened Feb. 17. Veterans and others have tried several times to remove the flag. A <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected a lawsuit contending the work desecrates the flag. `` I just think it's a sin to have the flag on the floor,'' said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorsma </PERSON>, 38, of suburban <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>. `` It bothers me tremendously.'' Student artist `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> on Saturday called his exhibit revolutionary, and said he had no apologies. The exhibit opened for a few minutes Sunday morning, but was closed after veterans repeatedly picked up the flag, said security guard <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. Veterans came to the demonstration from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. The crowd overflowed from the sidewalk in front of the building, closing busy <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. State Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON>, who has demonstrated against the work at the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> almost daily since the controversy began, said he would co-sponsor legislation to toughen laws against desecrating the flag. The Republican lawmaker and GOP mayoral candidate <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> distributed a list of corporate sponsors of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and urged a letter-writing campaign to pressure them into cutting off funding. `` We want them to know their money is supporting an institution that is desecrating the American flag,'' <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hueser </PERSON>, 43, burned his <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> membership card and said he would no longer support the institution.

 Police on Sunday recovered the last bodies from the crash site of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> jet. Investigators said the plane's voice and flight recorders were destroyed, making it harder to find the cause of the crash that killed 24 people. The chief investigator of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, would not rule out the possibility that snow and sleet on the wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 contributed to Friday's crash. Sixty-nine people were on board the Dutch-built jet when it took off from <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> and crashed a half mile away from the runway. `` All of the bodies that were in the burned-out fuselage have been removed,'' said <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> provincial police constable <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brayshaw </PERSON>. Twelve more bodies were recovered Sunday, bringing the total of bodies recovered to 22. Two of the 47 survivors died in hospitals. Police attributed the slow process of recovering the bodies to the thigh-deep snow and rough terrain at the site. A temporary morgue was set up at the hockey arena in this paper-mill town of 6,500 people 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> on the Trans-Canada Highway. Plans were made to send the burned bodies to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on Monday for identification. Investigators said Sunday that the plane's two black boxes melted in the fire that followed the crash. `` It will make the investigation tougher,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He said the boxes were at the tail end of the plane, away from the main fire, and he did not know why they were so badly damaged. As local churches in <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> held memorial services for the victims, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> denied allegations by some survivors that the twin-engine jet crashed because it was overloaded or had too much snow or ice on the wings. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, vice president of the regional commuter airline based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, told reporters the plane was not overloaded and the pilot was experienced in flying in bad weather. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not rule out the possibility that the wings had too much slush or snow. `` There are indications from various sources that the wings were contaminated with snow and slush,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We've been trying to find material evidence to prove there was snow and slush on the wings.'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said the damage to the plane, which broke into three pieces, was so extensive that `` it indeed was a miracle'' that 45 people survived. The plane's pilot, Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Morwood </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was one of three crew members who died in the crash. The other crew member, a stewardess, survived. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> said it would not release a passenger list until all the fatalities were identified. The last fatal crash in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> of a regularly scheduled commercial flight was in 1979, when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 went down in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing 17 people. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s worst air disaster occurred in 1985, when 256 people, mainly American servicemen returning to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, died in the crash of a chartered DC-8 in <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>.

 The sister of American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Sunday that she fears `` The Satanic Verses'' controversy has worsened relations between Moslem extremists and the West and made his release seem unlikely. `` The situation has fallen apart again,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said after a prayer service for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in his hometown in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It seems like every time we get close, something unpredictable happens.'' Immediately after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration in January, there were signs that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> might soon be freed after nearly four years in captivity in <LOCATION> Beruit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to Mrs. Say. She did n't specify what signs, but said the political climate at the time was more encouraging than it had been in many months But she said she feared that the animosity that has arisen over publication of `` The Satanic Verses'' by British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdi </PERSON> has damaged the political climate and made the release of Western hostages more remote. The Iranian government has called for <PERSON> Rusdie </PERSON>'s death on the grounds that the novel is blasphemous. `` The situation now is not very good,'' Mrs. Say said. `` But we're not going to give up.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in <LOCATION> Beruit </LOCATION>. He is the longest held of 13 foreign hostages. About 100 residents of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> listened to a roll call of the hostages in a high school gymnasium and heard Mrs. Say urge them not to allow <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to be forgotten. Mrs. Say believes that if <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captors think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people no longer care about the hostages, they will be killed. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is counting us to keep his cause alive,'' she said. Earlier, the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheider </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, appealed for the nation to show support for the hostages. <PERSON> Scheider </PERSON> said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s plight should be viewed from a humanitarian standpoint and not politically. Ex-hostages report that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is being held in a closet blindfolded and has been beaten by his captors. The service in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> was the first of a number of observances as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> enters his fifth year of captivity. Another service is planned Monday in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, with Mrs. Say and the Rev. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, who was imprisoned with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for a time in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Ex-hostages and hostage families will gather in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday for a service sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and a group known as No Greater Love. There also will be a service in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthplace <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> moved to upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when he was 6 and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Batavia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1965.

 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sent a message Monday to the 48 members of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, saying they had a particular role in combating the global threat of pollution. It was the queen's Commonwealth Day message to the organization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its colonies and followed speeches given last week by Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, her husband, and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, her son, on damage to the Earth's resources. She said nothing during the past year underlined world interdependence more forcefully than the growth in awareness of the serious dangers man's own activities pose to the environment. `` The threat to the environment takes many forms, of which some are so far reaching that it is difficult to grasp them,'' she said. `` We hear, for example, of the possibility of radical changes in our climate leading, among other things, to a rise in the sea level, with all that would mean for small islands and low-lying regions.'' The Commonwealth's concern for resources means partnership not only across the oceans but also between generations, she said. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the heir to the throne, addressed an international conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last week and appealed for the elimination of chlorofluorocarbon gases, which are destroying the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful radiation from the sun. In a lecture last week Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> spoke of the pressures of having to produce increasing amounts of food to feed growing populations and the strain that placed on the Earth's resources.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The French voted Sunday for new city councils in elections marked by a record low turnout, slight progress for leftist parties and the surprising emergence of the ecologists. The Socialists and Communists, who had squabbled for months over the formation of joint lists of candidates, lost some of their support to the greens, as the <ORGANIZATION> Ecologist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is known. The traditional right and center-right parties, the Rally for the Republic and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, suffered in some areas at the hands of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Turnout was estimated at between 70-73 .5 percent _ the lowest for municipal elections since the end of World War II Turnout in the last municipal elections in 1983 was 78.4 percent. In municipalities where no list won an absolute majority a second round of voting will be held next Sunday. That balloting will include all lists that received at least 10 percent of the first vote. With about 70 percent of the vote reported Sunday night, the ecologists, never previously a force in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, were expected to win between 4 and 5 percent of the vote nationally and more in some areas, such as 12.8 percent in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> and 14 percent in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brieuc </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where the mayor is <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, head of the nation's governing <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the greens won 8.4 percent. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, head of the ecologists, said his party was `` demonstrating that they are a political force that is implanting itself here as they are in other European countries. `` Public opinion is becoming aware of the gravity of the ecological crisis and the absence of will by successive governments, no matter what their political color, to deal with it.'' <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader who won 14.4 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election last spring, praised what he called his party's `` remarkable success.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has created the only novelty of this election because in 1983 it counted only 0.11 percent of the vote ... today it could be credited with 7 percent on the national level,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said. `` When you take into account that we did not present candidates in all cities ... that's a remarkable success.'' Municipal elections generally are fought on local issues but the results can provide a sense of the national power of the parties. Few significant changes were noted in Sunday's voting. Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said the vote confirmed `` the great choices that the president and the government have proposed to the country.'' <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Debarge </PERSON>, a national secretary of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said there was `` an unspectacular gain by the left, a certain loss by the traditional right and a stronger than expected resistance by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which I regret.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, a leading figure in the conservative Rally for the Republic, said his party would make no deals with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in the runoff elections. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called that attitude `` the road to suicide Voting took place in 36,757 communities. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s three largest cities, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, there appeared to be no big shakeups. Conservative Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was in no danger of losing control of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, though it appeared he would not sweep all 20 of the city's districts as he did six years ago. Warfare in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> between two Socialist lists, one official and the other unofficial, did not appear to benefit the right. In <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, conservative former Trade Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noir </PERSON> was virtually assured of ousting center-right Mayor <PERSON> Francisque </PERSON> <PERSON> Collomb </PERSON>. Disgruntled with a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist-Communist </ORGANIZATION> government, the French used the 1983 municipal elections to protest, allowing the right to take over many city halls previously held by the left. This time, with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> still riding comfortably high in the popularity polls, there seemed to be less of a protest vote. The Socialist and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> parties agreed to run joint lists of candidates in only about 60 percent of towns with more than 20,000 residents. Conservative and centrist candidates shared a slate of candidates in about 95 percent of those towns.

 Police wielding bamboo canes pushed back <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> women who tried to march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Sunday to protest Chinese rule and violence in their homeland. About 20 women sustained scrapes and scratches, either from the police officers' bamboo canes or from falling on the gravel when they tried to push through a metal barricade. Parliament was not in session at the time. Clashes between <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> demonstrators and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police last week in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s capital, left 16 people dead and more than 100 wounded by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official count. Western travelers said the death toll was higher and could be 20 or 30. The killings occurred during protests that began a few days before the anniversary of the March 10, 1959 uprising in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> that was quashed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Sunday's demonstration in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the day thousands of <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> women staged freedom marches in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> as men stayed indoors out of fear for their safety. On March 17, 1959, the Tibetans' spiritual and temporal leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, fled across the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he remains in exile with about 100,000 other Tibetans. After <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> police thwarted Sunday's march about a mile from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, about 200 women staged a peaceful protest beside <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Gate, the huge stone arch honoring Indian soldiers who died in the service of their British colonial rulers. As they chanted slogans calling for an end to Chinese rule, at least a half-dozen of the women fainted in the midday sun and were carried to shade trees by young women wearing T-shirts that read `` Free Tibet'' and `` Stop Repression in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, revered by Tibetan Buddhists as their god-king, has said he would accept Chinese control of military and foreign policy in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in exchange for greater autnomy. Tibetans say their homeland was independent before the Chinese invasion in 1949, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains it had been an integral part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for centuries.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Link Between Sex Hormones and Skeletal System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli researchers have found a link between sex hormones and the skeletal system of animals, opening the way to a better understanding of osteoporosis, the <ORGANIZATION> Weizmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The findings could help explain the high incidence of the degenerative bone disease in women following menopause, a statement from the institute said. The institute discovered in recent experiments with laboratory rats that the skeletal system responds to the animal's main sex hormone, the institute's statement said. Osteoporosis is characterized by increased porousness and brittleness in bones associated with the loss of calcium. It leads to an increased risk of fracture. An estimated 15 to 20 million people suffer from the disease in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone, resulting in an annual total of 1.3 million fractures with a mortality rate of 5 to 14 percent, according to figures from the institute. There is no known cure, only methods of slowing the progress of the disease. Although sex hormone deficiency has been associated with osteoporosis and such hormones have been used for treatment, the disease was believed to result from processes only indirectly related to hormone deficiency, said institute spokesman <PERSON> Nehemiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The research team was led by Professor <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> of the institute's hormone research and included his associates from <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The study is to be published in the `` Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The research shows that bones of female rats respond biologically to the female hormone estrogen but are unaffected by its male counterpart, testosterone. In male rats, bone tissue is stimulated selectively by testosterone. But <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> added: `` the situation in bones is quite complex, and the stimulatory effects of estrogen and testosterone here are closely linked to other factors,'' including the level of vitamin D metabolites. `` The interdependence of these reactions could help explain why there has never been a clear association between the level of blood estrogen and the appearance of osteoporosis,'' <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> said. Osteoporosis is much more prevalent in women, who may undergo an 80 percent reduction in estrogen production following menopause, the institute said. It noted that men show only a moderate lowering of testosterone levels. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> is a professor of endocrinology at the institute, which is a leading Israeli research facility in the natural sciences. It is in <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.

 Most people expect to find firearms at a shooting range and art in a museum. But the new King County Police range will combine the two with a sculpture made of guns. Artist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has melted down more than 100 firearms confiscated by police to create the sculpture that will be mounted outside the shooting range next month. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosford </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms and a retired police officer, called <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s project a `` totally inappropriate use of public funds'' and said the artist is using weapons to create an image that `` guns are bad.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> makes no bones about it. The artist, who lives in a high-crime area in central <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said his piece takes items with `` bad vibes'' and turns them into something pleasing and gentle. `` At least I'm taking some of these weapons out of circulation. I would like to take more,'' the 37-year-old artist said of the sawed-off shotguns, handguns and other objects in his sculpture. The $ 8,000 project for the range was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. King County Police Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnich </PERSON>, who for 20 years has overseen the property room where confiscated guns are stored, said all the weapons given to <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> were unsafe or illegal and must be destroyed by law anyway. `` It gives us a good place to get rid of them,'' he said. `` It's better than some other uses I've seen for them,'' agreed a colleague, police Lt. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>.

 The leaders of 45 Moslem states and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> meet Monday at a conference that will likely be dominated by Saudi-Iranian clashes over ethics and politics. This kingdom has refused to suppport <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death order against British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and it is not expected to change its position at the Organization of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The Saudis also are expected to clash with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the question of recognition of the Afghan guerrilla government. Arab diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sent a delegation to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> on Saturday for meetings to set the agenda for the four-day conference but that the delegation returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> without taking part in the meetings. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> delegation headed by the deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propagation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Taskhiri </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Sunday to attend the conference. Conference Secretary-General <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ghabid </PERSON> confirmed the conference will take up the issue of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s controversial novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' which some say blasphemes Islam. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s 16 million people are mainly Sunni Moslems. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people overwhelmingly belong to the Shiite Moslem sect, long at odds with the Sunnis Most Sunnis agree with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that `` The Satanic Verses'' should be banned. But they have stopped short of supporting <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call Feb. 14 for Moslems to seek out and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, an Indian-born Moslem who lives in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Shiites comprise one-tenth of the world's 1 billion Moslems, and the Iranians are clearly outnumbered in their bid to gain support for the death threat. But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> apparently wants to press ahead in an effort to persuade Moslems to view and support his campaign as a defense of Islam against the West. Two Iranian government envoys have been touring Islamic states seeking support for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s stance on the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affar. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jannati </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> on Sunday, and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazdi </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair is discussed daily by the Iranian media. Saudi newspapers have made no mention of it. Fourteen nations have withdrawn their top diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in protest of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence. The Saudis and Iranians have not had diplomatic relations since April, when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke ties, citing terrorism and subversion. One reason for the rupture was what the Saudis called Iranian-inspired riots during the 1987 annual Moslem pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. More than 400 people, most of them Iranians, were killed. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has long challenged the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family's guardianship of Islam's holiest shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> On the Afghan issue, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been a key supporter of Sunni Afghan guerrillas who fought the Soviets until the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last month after nine years of intervention.

Arab diplomatic sources said he was seeking to arrange a compromise between the guerrilla factions.

 After trying to blame leftist rebels, the military Sunday admitted responsibility for the Sept. 21 slaying of 10 peasants and said nine soldiers, including two officers, will stand trial for the massacre. The slayings and subsequent cover-up were `` a grave violation of normal operating procedures,'' said an armed forces statement. It said an intelligence unit major, a second lieutenant, two staff sergeants, a corporal and four privates from the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>'s Jiboa Battalion `` will be turned over to civilian judicial authorities'' to stand trial Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, a brigade officer relieved of his command, will be reinstated because he was innocent of any wrongdoing and was lied to by his subordinates, it said. `` I think it's a breakthrough,'' Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said of Sunday's developments. `` The high command of the armed forces is admitting that ... their earlier versions have not held up under examination and were wrong, scurrilous,'' he told a group of reporters. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said it was too early to say if the massacre case marked a real change in the military's traditional impunity in human rights abuses. At first, the military claimed the peasants were rebels who ambushed a Jiboa Battalion patrol and were killed in `` fierce combat'' in the hamlet of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, near brigade headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION>, a city 36 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. However, news reports quoting witnesses said a 33-man patrol marched into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, rounded up the village's 15 families in the schoolhouse, separated the 10 peasants and accused them of collaborating with guerrillas. Witnesses said the seven men and three women were taken to a nearby ravine, tied up, blindfolded and killed with hand grenades. Some witnesses said they also heard bursts of rifle fire after the explosions. The next day, the rest of the villagers found the bodies in the ravine covered with a banner of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebel coalition, witnesses said. The military claimed the peasants were killed after being detained for `` involvement in the activities of subversive organizations'' and possessing explosives and propaganda. Sunday's statement said an investigation found the soldiers had lied to their superiors and that Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> <PERSON> Granados </PERSON>, an intelligence officer, had ordered the peasants killed. It was the worst mass slaying of civilians in four years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which provides <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with an average of $ 1.5 million daily in military and economic aid, has been pressing the government to bring those responsible to justice. During a visit in February, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted that those responsible be sought and tried. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who rarely leaves the capital because of the war, visited the provincial judge handling the case to stress <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in the affair. An estimated 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began more than nine years ago.

<HEAD>Health Agency Counselors Must Break `AIDS' News to Partners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Shellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> was interviewing for a job with the <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, she wondered how she'd ever handle the grim task of telling people they had AIDS or were exposed to the disease. `` I remember asking myself how can anyone stand that kind of job every day,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, program coordinator in the sexually transmitted disease division. `` It can be depressing,'' she said. `` But ... if we've helped others avoid getting infected with AIDS, then it's all worth it.'' In the last nine months, she and other health department employees across <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have been tracking down people who have had dangerous contact with AIDS patients _ either through sexual relations or sharing of hypodermic drug needles _ to break the news that they may have been exposed to the deadly virus. A state law that took effect last July requires everyone who tests positive for the AIDS virus to notify their sex partners or anyone with whom they shared needles. The law allows victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome to simply give the names of their partners to their local health department and let officials spread the word. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has been a leading state in passing legislation to fight AIDS, including a law requiring AIDS tests for people seeking marriage licenses. The law has been blamed for sending many couples to adjoining states to get married. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, notification of possible AIDS infection is not spreading as quickly as health officials would like because of a lack of manpower. `` We do the best we can but we've only got two investigators to cover the entire city,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s AIDS surveillance unit `` We've made about 70 or 80 notification attempts and been successful on about 40 or 50.'' He said the need to protect confidentiality also makes the job difficult. `` People with AIDS are losing their jobs, their families, their incomes,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` We must protect them and be discreet.'' Like Mrs. <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> finds the job depressing at times. `` The emotions go from A to Z,'' he said. `` Some people are absolutely shocked. Others are not surprised. It can get to you. But you have to view it with a professional eye.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> is motivated by the need to educate people about the dangers and facts of being exposed to AIDS. `` We try not to give them a false sense of hope,'' she said. `` We also tell them that they are n't necessarily infected with AIDS simply because they've been exposed to it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> statistics show 2,580 cases of AIDS have been reported in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with the bulk of those, 2,329, in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. A random survey of health departments in central Illinois only produced a handful of instances where the AIDS notification law has been invoked, but officials expect that phase of their job to grow with the number of AIDS cases. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had its first case reported in 1984 and there were seven last year, bringing the total to 14 _ half of which have been fatal.

 `` Roseanne'' star <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> was named favorite female performer in a new television series, and the World War II saga `` War and Rememberance'' won best miniseries in the 15th annual People's Choice awards Sunday night. `` I'd like to accept this award on behalf of all the working moms and housewives,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> situation comedy chronicles the life of a blue-collar mother. The comedian received more votes than `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' star <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> or `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' actress <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> in the nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> poll that determined the awards. `` War and Rememberance,'' the globe-spanning story of a family during World War II based on <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>'s novel of the same name, was picked over `` Favorite Son'' and `` Elvis and Me'' for best miniseries. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> miniseries' disappointing ratings had led to predictions that the miniseries format might be doomed. `` ` War and Rememberance' was an enormous undertaking and one that required an almost unbelievable commitment from everyone involved in the production,'' said miniseries star <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>, who accepted the award from <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, who received her award early in the two-hour nationally telecast awards ceremony hosted by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, was also nominated as best female performer with <PERSON> Phylicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. `` Roseanne'' joined `` The Cosby Show'' and `` Cheers'' in the nominations for best comedy series, while `` Roseanne'' also picked up a nomination for best new comedy series with `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' and `` The Wonder Years.'' `` The Cosby Show'' also was nominated with `` M-A-S-H'' and `` Star Trek'' as best all-time television show.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, opera's most famous coloratura soprano, who made her Metropolitan Opera debut in `` Lucia di Lammermoor'' in 1961 to great acclaim, sang her first solo recital at the Met on Sunday and again deserved the acclaim she received. Her husband, conductor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonynge </PERSON>, was her deferential piano accompanist. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> has spent most of her career in the bel canto opera repertoire, singing soprano parts written to show off the sound of the voice, its beauty, flexibility and accuracy, with much less emphasis on the words. She chose that type of song and aria for her recital. She's still a singer well worth hearing, who can be greatly enjoyed and appreciated. For the most part, she did n't choose flamboyant selections and she only chose two that are generally familiar. Those were <PERSON> Balfe </PERSON>'s `` I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls'' and <PERSON> Offenbach </PERSON>'s `` O mon cher amant'' from `` La Perichole. Many of the songs were extravagantly melancholy, like the first, `` Sad Likeness of my Phyllis'' by <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>, with its line `` I have shed bitter tears over your ashes.'' Her one encore was `` There's No Place Like Home.'' As she sang it, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> glanced up and around the opera house. The Met is n't `` ever so humble'' but it has been one of her special homes, where she is always happily greeted, for almost three decades It's interesting that even a simple tune like `` There's No Place like Home'' sounds like an aria when <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> sings it. Several of the other songs in the recital were combinations of folk and art songs. They sounded, sung by this singer, like classical art songs. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> did n't use her first two or three songs to loosen her vocal chords. She sounded fine from the beginning. Her `` silver flute'' voice has become a bit darker but not much; the difference is heard more in added warmth. Her accuracy is phenomenal. She sang perfect trills in some of the brief coloratura passages. The two selections on the program with the most exciting coloratura were <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>'s 1850 `` Io non sono piu l'Annetta'' and <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON>'s 1888 `` Autumn Thoughts.'' We particularly enjoyed <PERSON> Tosti </PERSON>'s flowingly melodic `` La serenata'' and the six <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON> songs. Other composers heard were <PERSON> Meyerbeer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bizet </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chaminade </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Godard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gounod </PERSON>. Sometimes <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s tone sounds a bit hollow and sometimes she scoops up to notes, which is n't new. But her tone is beautiful; she is n't shrill or harsh. The capacity audience jumped up to award the singer a standing ovation.

 The annual Calle Ocho festival drew crowds estimated at more than 1 million people to the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> section Sunday despite a gang-related shooting and controversy over a ban on singers who performed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A boy was hospitalized in stable condition following the shooting, which involved rival youth gangs three blocks from the edge of the festival, police said. Four juveniles were arrested and charged with attempted murder. Nearly 300 people were arrested at the festival, mostly youths charged with fighting, drinking or disorderly conduct, police said. One officer was slightly injured when he was hit above the left eye with a bottle. More than a million people flocked to the 23-block <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> area _ whose main street is Eighth Street, or <LOCATION> Calle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocho </LOCATION> _ for Latin music, dancing and food, according to police and the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Amid the fun, the weeklong dispute over the ban of singers <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalafe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanez </PERSON> and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> seemed almost forgotten. The bans drew sharp criticism from many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where hard-line opposition to any contacts with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is not as widespread as in the past. Some remained upset Sunday night. `` I would like to see <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanez </PERSON> right here,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Morese </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` It's not fair.'' Food vendor <PERSON> Malee </PERSON> <PERSON> Buther </PERSON> said the controversy may have kept some people away. `` Last year was so crowded, you had to push people to walk,'' she said. `` This year there are not so many people.'' Kiwanis officials tried to avoid further controversy involving <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, a Dominican merengue idol who performed for 10,000 dancing fans in <LOCATION> Bayside </LOCATION> downtown Saturday despite disclosures he performed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> 10 years ago. Kiwanis officials claimed they lacked proof <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> played in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, even as a local radio station played excerpts from his `` Habana Jam'' album. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> declined to answer questions about the issue, discussing only his performance of fast, Dominican ballroom dance music. `` It was a contagious merengue and the people vibrated with the sound,'' he said.

 The bomb that blew up in a van being driven by the wife of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain who mistakenly ordered the destruction of an Iranian airliner was a non-military device, possibly homemade, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The bomb was `` an improvised exploding device, that would suggest it was not some kind of a manufactured, military bomb,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Riehl </PERSON> said. `` A pipe bomb would fit into that generic family,'' he said, adding that it may have been homemade. The bomb set fire to a van being driven Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, whose husband, Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, commander of the USS Vincennes in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, gave the go-ahead last July to shoot down an aircraft mistakenly believed to be an Iranian fighter. The plane, identified only from its radar blip, was actually a civilian airliner and all 290 people on board were killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was not hurt. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in its Monday editions, quoted an unidentified federal official as saying investigators have compiled a description of a man of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> appearance who was seen in the <ORGANIZATION> Rogerses </ORGANIZATION>' neighborhood in the past several months. The official said the man approached passersby, asking, `` Where does the captain live?'' <PERSON> Riehl </PERSON> refused to disclose more of what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation had found and also declined to comment on an Iranian newspaper editorial that blamed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for the bombing, saying it was engineered to provoke anti-Iranian sentiment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have no response to that at all,'' he said. The English-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> linked the alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to Western anger at <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed for his new novel, `` The Satanic Verses. The bombing `` will not be the last attempt to implicate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'' over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> controversy, <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial summarized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied the allegation and added, `` We have never made any linkage to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since this incident happened.'' The special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, met Sunday with the <ORGANIZATION> Rogerses </ORGANIZATION>. They have been under the continuous protection of <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> agents at an undisclosed location since shortly after the bombing. `` It was a ` How are you feeling?' type of thing,'' said <PERSON> Riehl </PERSON>. `` I think the meeting was more to reassure them a little bit or to help them through their trouble.'' <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said the security surrounding the couple would continue indefinitely. `` They are in good spirits,'' <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said, `` and they are aware of the necessity for security.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Rogerses </ORGANIZATION> returned home briefly Saturday afternoon, presumably to collect belongings. Chief <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Huebler </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was awaiting <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> findings to determine if the couple would return to work Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> is a teacher. The captain remained in command of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, whose home port is <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Grease-gobbling germs that eat themselves to death while cleaning drains are the secret weapons of a fledgling franchise business that bills itself as an `` HMO for restaurants.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than 200 clients in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is gearing up for a nationwide grease-busting attack with the backing of a venture capital arm of <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based chemical and natural resources company. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bio-Care </PERSON>'s founder and chairman, has big plans for the little bugs his company uses, which he claims are safer to handle than harsh chemical remedies. `` Every sink and toilet in the country is a potential client,'' he said. `` In our conservative projections, we figure we will service about 10 percent of the 500,000 food service outlets in 60 months, and the company at that time will have a value well over $ 200 million,'' he said. The only way to get that many clients that fast, he said, is through a franchise organization. `` We have to open up the flood gates to the entrepreneur in the areas who want to do this kind of business.'' Bio-Care is like an HMO, or health maintenance organization, because it offers regular maintenance at a fixed price and will correct any problems at no additional cost, <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. `` It seems to be working fairly well,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, kitchen manager at the TGI Friday's chain restaurant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>. `` We had enough problems before that we needed a service like this. They come out once a week for 15 or 20 minutes and spray into the drains in the restaurants and outside. They guarantee their work, so it seems a good deal.'' The bugs that eat the grease are a blend of naturally occurring bacilli and pseudomonas bacteria that have been selectively adapted for Bio-Care by <ORGANIZATION> Sybron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sybron </ORGANIZATION>, a private company based in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest supplier of specialized bacterial cultures for the pollution control industry The company has sales of about $ 120 million a year. No genetic engineering was involved in creating the Bio-Care formula. Instead, the bacteria were chosen and cultivated for their ability to work together as they break down the types of foods that usually clog drains. Several kinds of the bacteria were developed and patented more than a decade ago. Others were mixed in to suit <PERSON> Bio-Care </PERSON>'s focus on cleaning up the gunk most often found in restaurant kitchen drains. It took nearly three years to come up with a formula, test it, refine it and produce a final product. The bacteria break down animal fats and food products, liquifying and digesting them and turning them into carbon dioxide, water and bacterial cells, the same way waste is normally disposed of in nature. The Bio-Care bacteria keep eating and multiplying until their food source is gone. Then they die off. `` They grow very rapidly as long as there's a lot of food around, and can double as fast as every 20 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupka </PERSON>, marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Sybron </ORGANIZATION>'s biochemical division. `` But then the beauty of it is, once whatever is clogging the drain goes away or is totally consumed, the bacteria run out of food and die off. They eat themselves to death.'' About 5 billion bacteria are in each gram in the teabag-like `` Bio-Sock'' packets used by Bio-Care to eliminate grease trap overflow and reduce toxic odors associated with hydrogen sulfide accumulation. `` These are all certified non-pathogenic bacteria, meaning they do n't cause disease,'' <PERSON> Krupka </PERSON> said. `` They are not used primarily to get rid of clogs but rather for preventive maintenance. It keeps the grease from accumulating in the pipes and it's not harsh or dangerous to handle the way strong chemicals can be.'' Clogged drains are more quickly cleared through a mechanical process. Then the bacteria are used regularly to keep them clear, he said. By April 1, Bio-Care plans to have franchise applications filed in all 50 states. By the end of the year it expects to have 15 franchises in operation. `` We're going to grow it very slow so everybody has the opportunity to never make mistakes; we're trying to make all the mistakes now,'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said.

 Channel One, the new television service that is beaming daily news shows with commercials into six schools, plans to produce its first live broadcast Monday with coverage of the space shuttle launch. The special broadcast, which will contain no commercials, will be sent to the six schools participating in a test of the new service for use at their discretion, the program's creators said Friday. Channel One is produced by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media concern that has given about $ 50,000 worth of televisions, video equipment and satellite dishes to each of the six test schools to receive its daily 12-minute news show. Each show contains up to two minutes of paid ads. Some educators have denounced the project, which debuted March 6, for permitting advertisers to intrude into the classroom. The space launch coverage will be separate from the daily news show. It will feature live video supplied by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> via satellite along with commentary from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> studio by the regular Channel One news anchors and a space travel expert. The Discovery launch is tentatively scheduled for Monday morning. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said the plans for a live broadcast provide `` an exciting example of what Channel One can do.''

 The jury in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation trial asked Sunday to review all charts, graphs and closing arguments in its second day of deliberations in the Wall Street fraud case. The panel is deciding whether <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, tried to illegally boost the share price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 prior to the sale of a large block of the stock. The case is the first to reach the trial phase in a series of prosecutions by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office emanating from Wall Street's insider trading scandals. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were indicted last July on charges of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The company faces up to $ 12 million in fines while <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 40 years in jail and fined $ 2 million. After a six-week re-trial, the jury received the case from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and began deliberating Saturday, when it re-heard testimony by the government's star witness, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials and the union representing <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> production workers have authorized a new study of work conditions at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> plant, where dozens of employees say they've fallen ill from working with chemicals. Company and union officials on Friday confirmed the new study. Last year, dozens of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> plant employees who worked with phenolic resins complained of illnesses ranging from headaches and nausea to memory loss. Twenty workers filed insurance claims. The illnesses were the subject of congressional hearings two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and federal inspectors found the plant to be in compliance with safety standards, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> still halted use of the resins, used to make plastic parts for aircraft interiors. `` We're not convinced nor do we know that's the only problem,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Aerospace workers, which represents 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said questions still linger about whether low-level exposure to the resins might cause health problems, even if chemical levels in the air are within government limits.

<HEAD>Futures Industry Leaders To Meet Under Cloud Of Federal Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the futures industry will meet this week in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the traditional sunny setting for their annual gathering. But it will be clouded this year by a federal investigation of trading fraud at the world's two largest futures exchanges. Nearly two months have elapsed since the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` sting'' operation at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was disclosed. No indictments have been issued and the story has been replaced on the financial pages by fresher controversies. Yet the scandal remains a major concern among the 1,100 brokerage executives, money managers and exchange officers registered for the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting, and talk of it is likely to surface frequently in both private conversations and public discussions during the three-day affair. `` People are calling me every day and asking ` What's going on with this thing?''' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based trade group. `` Hardly a day goes by that we do n't talk about what effect the investigation and the allegations are going to have on the program. But only the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> knows for sure where the probe is headed, and it's not talking. What is known is that hundreds of grand-jury subpoenas have been issued, many of them to futures traders who have been questioned about the opportunities for cheating customers while executing their orders in the boisterous futures pits. <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> said the government's investigation did not play a major role in shaping the <ORGANIZATION> FIA </ORGANIZATION> meeting program. But neither has the association shied away from scheduling sessions in which probe-related issues are bound to arise. Thursday's conference-opening panel discussion on self-regulation and trading practices may further illuminate the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges' responses to the criticism that has buffeted the industry since the investigation was revealed Board of Trade Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> `` Cash'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> will be among the panelists. `` I think you will find the possibility that a guy like <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> might discuss some of the changes the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has announced,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, who will moderate the session and who is himself president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a congressionally mandated self-regulatory organization. The Board of Trade is planning a $ 1 million upgrade of its computerized trade-surveillance system, which federal regulators recently criticized as inadequate for detecting abuses, and both <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges are reviewing their trading rules. Futures are contracts to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument for a specified price at a future date. The <ORGANIZATION> FIA </ORGANIZATION> meeting also will include a speech Thursday by <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates futures trading. And it will give many in the industry their first look at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s planned off-hours electronic trading system. The investigation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is hastening the move toward electronic trading, which will permit around-the-clock trading of futures contracts and, some contend, provide a better audit trail than traditional open-outcry trading. The Board of Trade revealed last month that it was working on an electronic trading system to compete with <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, a similar system being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, has accepted a $ 436 million takover bid from the Prospect Group, creator of a successful railroad in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> three years ago, the companies announced. The announcement came six weeks after the New York-based conglomerate launched the unsolicited $ 20-a-share cash takeover offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, a major carrier of freight between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The railroad originally gave a neutral reaction to Prospect's bid. Prospect and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> said in a joint statement Friday that the railroad had accepted the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, which has 21.8 million shares outstanding, is a spinoff of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that began trading as an independent company Jan. 3 at $ 11 a share. The railroad formerly was called the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> is the name adopted last year by the former <ORGANIZATION> IC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- board has unanimously determined that the Prospect offer and the merger ... are fair to, and in the best interests of, the shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the railroad company. Illinois Central's financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, found the offer to be fair to shareholders, the statement said. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Prospect, said the company looks forward to `` continuing the long and fine traditions of the Illinois Central and working with the company's many excellent employees and customers.'' The Prospect Group owns <ORGANIZATION> MidSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a regional railroad based in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, that has enjoyed great success since Prospect created it three years ago, partly with the purchase of Illinois Central track. `` It was one of these dream stories,'' Prospect spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was profitable in its first year -LRB- 1987 -RRB-, with revenues of $ 55 million and net earnings of $ 5 million, and it did much better in 1988, with $ 80 million in revenues and $ 8.7 million in earnings. `` That was Prospect's introduction into railroads, and it eventually led to the interest in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 19.75 a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down 87 -LCB- cents.

<HEAD>Boeing Says Commercial Jet Market Worth $516 Billion Through 2005</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has increased its estimate of the commercial jetliner market for the next 16 years, saying it expects 8,417 aircraft worth a total $ 516 billion will be delivered by the end of 2005. The new forecast is in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s just-released Current Market Outlook, which it publishes each year. The report applies to the commercial jet industry as a whole and is not limited to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. The dollar value is 24.6 percent above last year's estimate of $ 414 billion, while the estimated number of aircraft has grown by 1,509 from the 6,908 forecast in the 1988 report. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> director of market research, said the revised estimates are based on prolonged air travel growth fueled by continued growth in discretionary income and the decrease in the real cost of travel after allowing for inflation. The report predicts relatively stable fuel prices and no recession for the foreseeable future. About 70 percent of the new planes will be needed for growth in traffic, the report said, with the rest to replace aircraft going out of service. While some industry analysts believe replacement sales will accelerate because of concerns over aging aircraft, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said that maintaining current fleets might be less expensive for airlines. Replacement with new jets could drive up operating costs and therefore the cost to the public, which could slow air travel growth, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> estimates that on average, airlines replace jets after 28 years, while others use a 25-year estimate. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had predicted that 250 to 300 planes would be retired in 1988, but in fact only 60 were. `` The current fleets are very reliable,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Airlines and air traveler confidence in the safety of these airplanes has not been lost.'' Still, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s report indicates that replacements through 2005 will be 20 percent higher in dollar value than last year's estimate. The report estimates stronger demand for airplanes in the 170-to 240-seat category, with the larger aircraft taking over domestic routes that have outgrown medium-sized airplanes in domestic service. It also predicts a strong increase in short - to medium-range jets of more than 350 seats and a modest increase in demand for large, long-range aircraft

By contrast, white women are lagging in their attempt to close the wage gap with their male counterparts, said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a research associate with the school's Population Studies Center. `` This improvement in the earnings of black women compared with those of black men is the result of greater educational attainment, more occupational opportunities for black women and a virtual stagnation of the earnings of black men in the last 15 years,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said last week. In 1986, he said, black women ages 25 to 54 earned an average of $ 12,100 a year, or about 75 percent of the average black male's yearly salary of $ 16,000 White women in the same age bracket averaged $ 12,800, roughly half the average white male's annual pay. `` Compared with the incomes of most black men, the average black woman's income has risen sharply since World War II,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said, noting that in 1947, black women earned only 34 percent of a black man's average salary. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> conducted the study with <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON>, a demographer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> of the Census' Center for Demographic Studies.

 Top officials of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to publicly debate issues in a contract dispute that has left coal miners in three Appalachian states without a contract for more than a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> suggested the rare public forum after a demonstration by coal miners outside <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> last month, and invited <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and Mine Workers President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> to participate. In separate letters Friday to the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Deyton </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> and fellowship chairman, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> accepted the offer and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> designated <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as the company's representative at the debate. No date has been set for the forum in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said they hope it can be scheduled soon. In their original letters to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, the clergy expressed hope that `` an evening of discussion ... would help bring about a healthy reconciliation.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have been working for more than a year without a contract in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pittson </PERSON>, a diversified company that also is involved in air freight and security systems, employs about 1,700 people in 20 mines. It has laid off about 4,000 miners in recent years due to technological advances and the closing of mines. Miners threatened to strike Feb. 1, one year after agreeing to work without a contract while negotiations continued, but accepted a 30 - to 60-day cooling off period requested by the governors of the three states <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was skeptical at first about the forum, saying last week, `` I certainly have a hard time understanding how <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> can be helpful in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s most affluent communities, located near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said in his statement that the clergy had `` earned out respect and appreciation'' for sponsoring the forum.
