<TEXT>
 Public Order Minister <PERSON> Tassos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> resigned Monday after a Greek-American banker indicted in a $ 30 million financial scandal fled the country, apparently aboard a yacht. The conservative opposition immediately demanded the resignation of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government, claiming it was staging a cover-up. Banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, 34, disappeared Saturday afternoon. A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> fled abroad on Sunday, apparently by yacht from the seaside village of <LOCATION> Megalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pefko </LOCATION>, 20 miles from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> said a warrant had been issued for <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' arrest. One week ago, <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was banned from leaving <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> pending the outcome of an official enquiry into alleged financial irregularities at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, which he controls. <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON>, whose ministry was responsible for police surveillance of <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, said he was resigning `` since such -LRB- public order ministry -RRB- omissions ... create an issue of political sensitivity.'' The scandal has shaken the government because of accusations in Greek newspapers that senior socialist officials were involved in illegal deals set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. The socialists also have been criticized for permitting <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> to build a multi-million dollar banking and media empire in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since 1984 without adequate checks by the central bank on his financial background. The government last week pledged `` absolute clarity'' in uncovering the scandal and warned there will be `` no pardons' for members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- who may be implicated. `` The Greek people are left with the conviction that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was spirited away so that he would not speak. The responsibility goes all the way to the top of the government pyramid,'' <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, leader of the New Democracy main opposition party party, said in a statement demanding the government resign. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was suspended Oct. 20 as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> and indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement. Last week <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> appeared before a district attorney on a charge of forging documents purporting to show that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> had $ 13 million invested with the American brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. He was not detained but given until Nov. 14 to prepare his defense. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> also is accused of forging documents purporting to show his bank had another $ 17 million in an account with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bank, <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms have said they had no record of the deposits. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, who holds both <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Greek citizenship, bought a controlling interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 after working in its central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> branch for six years as an accountant. Rival newspapers have claimed <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> illegally used <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> money to fund his publishing group <PERSON> Grammi </PERSON>, which controls three daily newspapers, five magazines and a radio station. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> resigned Oct. 29 as chairman of <PERSON> Grammi </PERSON>, the day after the premier's son, Education Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, denounced as a forgery a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> statement showing a $ 2.3 million transfer to a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> account in his name. The younger <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> showed reporters a letter from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer saying there was no record at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> of such a transfer. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' parents, brother, wife and five children all have left <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> during the past week.

 Police arrested 377 people, including prominent pediatrician and social activist <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spock </PERSON>, on Monday in the culmination of a long series of protests on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> called to focus attention on the plight of the homeless in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We're here to show the politicians that there is a crisis in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a crisis that they are not responding to, a crisis that we want answers for,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> advocate for the homeless and organizer of the protests. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> led a march and 90-minute rally across Constitution Avenue from the Capitol building, capping the event with his exhortation to the crowd to sit down in the middle of the street and be arrested as way of showing concern for the homeless. Some 377 followed <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>'s appeal and were arrested by police on charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing traffic on Capitol grounds, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Capitol police. The protest and arrests had been coordinated with Capitol police and were generally quiet. About 2,000 persons attended the rally, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. One of the speakers was the Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who had originally taken part in the march to the Capitol from a motel five miles away. She left the march to promote her new line of perfume, `` Uninhibited,'' but returned to the rally in a black van limousine. She left shortly before the arrests began. `` I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go do my job,'' she explained. `` I'm here to show my concern and my support for the homeless. I'm very committed to the cause of the homeless People have to have it brought into their consciousness that the plight of the homeless is very serious.'' <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, organized a series of protests beginning Sept. 26 to call attention to the plight of the homeless. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennelly </PERSON>, a member of the organization who also joined in the fast, has been bedridden and did not participate in Monday's protest. A total of 239 people have been arrested by Capitol police during the protest, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Most were charged with unlawful entry. The rally took on the trappings of a political gathering, with dozens of people in the crowd sporting `` Dukakis-Bentsen'' buttons and signs in support of the Democratic presidential ticket. No signs in support of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee, were apparent. `` We've already seen what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can do during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` Whoever wins the election, it will be a long fight to improve the situation for the homeless, but I think it will be easier if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins.''

 Lawmakers angered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a bill to limit advertising in children's TV programs say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be back next year with another, possibly tougher measure. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> killed the bill late Saturday night with a pocket veto, even though the measure had overwhelming support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Critics likened his action to `` ideological child abuse'' and called his administration `` morally bankrupt.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the bill to impose ad limits and make children's informational programming a condition of station license renewals would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech and might discourage commercial networks from financing quality children's But Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., co-author of the bill, said the veto was another example of the administration putting `` commercial considerations and ideological precepts ahead of children's interests. `` The president's actions represent a victory for the toy and cereal hucksters, but a major defeat for our nation's children,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted on bad advice in killing the measure. `` It was a rather conservative piece of legislation with a minimal amount'' of regulation, far less onerous than earlier proposals that were considered but set aside in favor of the bipartisan compromise, he said. `` Next year, whoever is president will be faced with a tougher bill and a more determined <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> predicted. The measure would have limited advertising in children's shows to 10 -LCB- minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had imposed similar limits on broadcasters but scrapped them four years ago in the belief that self-regulation by the industry would determine what was best for children. The bill also would have required TV broadcasters to provide educational and informational programming for children as a condition of license renewal. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure on a voice vote last month. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed it by a margin of 328-78 in June. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while he supports efforts to improve the quality of children's programs, `` this bill simply can not be reconciled with the freedom of expression secured by our Constitution.'' He said, `` the Constitution simply does not empower the federal government to oversee the programming decisions of broadcasters in the manner prescribed by this bill.'' Children's television advocates had pushed for the bill because they said that under the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s philosophy of deregulation, children's TV has become overcommercialized and the quality of programs has suffered. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mass.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which has worked 20 years for passage of the measure, said she was `` flabbergasted'' by the veto. `` Here was a bill that was not going to raise the deficit, not going to raise taxes, was going to get a little bit of education for children ... and what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said was you do n't have to do anything for children. I call it ideological child abuse,'' she said. The measure was a bipartisan compromise that had been stripped of proposals to outlaw shows, called `` program-length commercials'' by critics, that feature toy manufacturers' products and to require broadcasters to air an hour of educational programming per day. The final measure had the tacit support of the broadcasting industry after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> lobbied effectively against the stronger versions of the bill. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` while we recognize this legislation charted some new territory, we were willing to accept its outcome.'' The veto puts back on track an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the commercialization of children's TV. The commission is considering whether it is necessary to impose advertising limits and regulate program-length commercials and interactive toys that respond to inaudible signals beamed through TV sets. But lawmakers and children's TV advocates say they do not expect the current <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to depart from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's philosophy of deregulation

 On a recent trip back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> insisted on shaking hands with every student who goes to school on the huge ranch where he was born. As they filed past the first Hispanic member of a president's Cabinet, the son of a ranch hand told each child how he too had once studied in the tiny schoolhouse nestled among the prickly brush and mesquite trees on the King Ranch `` You can do it if you just stay in school,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told them. `` When we talk to young people about opportunity through education, it helps to have a man at the top who proves through his own life and experience that the American system of opportunity through education works,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was born on the King Ranch, which is the largest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and covers 914,000 acres in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The ranch, which includes parts of six counties between <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, is the bedrock of one of the nation's biggest oil and gas fortunes and is credited with the development of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gertrudis </LOCATION> cattle breed, the first native to this country. <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is chairman of the privately held ranch. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who began his schooling along with other cowboys' Spanish-speaking children at the ranch, became education secretary on Sept. 20 His nomination by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> from a list of Latino candidates was criticized by Hispanic leaders as a political ploy to bolster Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Hispanic community. Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said at the time: `` It seems that the administration has just discovered that Hispanics exist.'' But he praised <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and its medical school since 1980, as `` well respected, well prepared, with a history in education that is second to none.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> will serve until Jan. 20 unless reappointed by the next president and brushes aside questions about the next turn in his career, saying he reached his life's goal when he became a full professor. He is firm in insisting no deal has been struck for him to remain in the Cabinet if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins on Tuesday, but speculation is strong that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> would be asked to stay. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has campaigned for the Republican ticket in trips that include visits to local schools, and emphasizes the need to keep students from dropping out and to educate the illiterate, handicapped and dyslexic to their fullest potential. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he says, 45 percent of Hispanics do n't finish high school, while the rate for blacks is 32 percent. The national average is 28.5 percent. While economic troubles, early marriage, drugs or alcohol are blamed for the Hispanic dropout rate, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> sees those as merely symptoms of an unraveling family structure unable to give children the support and confidence they need. `` If the family structure is tight and intact and if it values education, if it really wants to see these young people move ahead; I think therein is the fundamental problem. ... If that family structure is not a good, tight structure that supports education and encourages education and raises the vision of young people and says ` Yes son, yes daughter, you will educate yourself,' ... they can fall into the social ills I talked about.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> credits his parents _ a cattle foreman and a homemaker who never went to college _ with encouraging their five children to get degrees. One son, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, became a four-star Army general, and another, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, was an all-America running back who now owns a ranch. A father of 10, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' voice fills with emotion when he recalls graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> with his bachelor's degree. `` I was so proud, so proud, when I looked at my father when I got my baccalaureate degree,'' he says. `` And his pride in me when I went up the academic ladder there was so clear.''

<HEAD>Voluntary Safety Programs Fail To Reduce Fishing Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Coast Guard's voluntary safety programs have failed to reduce the number of accidents and deaths in the nation's most dangerous industry, commercial fishing, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The two agencies are about to lock horns again over the issue, with the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> pressing for mandatory licensing of captains and mandatory safety training for crews. Coast Guard officials insist their voluntary programs already have reduced the number of fishing boat accidents and fatalities, a contention disputed by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. `` Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> statement that fishing vessel casualty rates for 1986 and 1987 have decreased, safety board accident investigations indicate that major marine fishing vessel and property loss rates have not decreased from January 1978 until July 1988, and the death rate has increased in recent months,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent report. The report focused on the sinking of the Seattle-based fishing vessel UYAK II in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> almost a year ago. Two crew members, including the captain, were rescued but the bodies of four others were never recovered. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the 115-foot vessel began to list, but it was not equipped with a general alarm system that could have alerted the crew to the problem. In the report and in a mid-October letter to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the safety board once again urged the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to seek congressional approval for a series of mandatory regulations including captain licensing, vessel inspection and crew safety training. `` We laid out what we think needs to be done, but our recommendations have no force of law,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> says the fishing industry has the poorest safety record of any industry in the nation and the death rate for fishermen is seven times the national average for all industry groups. From January 1978 to April 1987, the safety board investigated 207 major fishing accidents which involved the loss of 147 lives and a total property loss of more than $ 165 million. That breaks down to 1.8 accidents, $ 1.4 million worth of property loss and 1.3 deaths per month. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did approve legislation requiring commercial fishing vessels to carry such basic safety equipment as life rafts, survival suits and emergency transmitters. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has 90 days to respond to the latest <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommendations, most of which it has rejected outright over the past three years. For instance, since early 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has at least three times rejected the recommendation that it seek authority from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to license fishing vessel captains. `` Before taking the more radical step of requiring these masters to be licensed, the voluntary program should be given a chance to demonstrate how effective it can be,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said casualty rates declined in 1986 and 1987 and `` in our view, part of this improvement may be attributed to the voluntary program.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also said mandatory licensing would require 225 new employees, cost $ 9 million to set up and $ 800,000 a year to run. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said agencies often are reluctant to adopt <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommendations and that it takes time to win them over. `` We hope eventually they see the light,'' he said, adding that because it has only the power of recommendation the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> sometimes has to `` regulate by raised eyebrow.''

<TEXT>
 The days of champagne and plastic roses are coming to an end in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, a country running short of imported money to pay for imported goods. The government Saturday imposed taxes and restrictions on imports aimed at saving $ 200 million a year in foreign currency for this country of 2.8 million people. `` We started developing a champagne budget on a beer pocketbook ... This is why -LRB- the economy -RRB- has to be adjusted,'' said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The belt-tightening move appeared to be the first step in what the official said would be a three - to five-year period during which <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> hopes to slash its $ 6 to $ 7 billion foreign debt The government banned new letters of credit to finance cars and trucks, video recorders, refrigerators, microwave ovens, television sets, chandeliers, marble, plastic flowers and fruit, and a dozen other goods. Finance Minister <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> announced on television Sunday night that banning chandeliers alone will save $ 3 million. Goods already financed were slapped with stiff import duties, sending the price of some TV sets up 40 percent. To help cushion the blow, the government cut electricity and water bills. The blacklist targets the posh Western lifestyle many Jordanians adopted in the early 1980s, when their country was flush with money, much of it imported by hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> with Jordanian passports who worked in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` It will touch the conspicuous consumer class, which unfortunately we have developed,'' said <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that `` the large masses of people'' would not be affected by the restrictions. Some officials have said privately that the economy has been hurt by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision in July to renounce sovereignty over Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> governed from 1948 to 1967. Plans to remove their citizenship and give them two-year instead of five-year passports led some Palestinians to withdraw savings from <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> banks because of the uncertainty of their status in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, one official said. One Western diplomat who requested anonymity estimated that nearly 30 percent of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s currency is held by Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The new restrictions also follow a slide in the value of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s once - stable currency, the dinar, which was worth about $ 3 last year, drifted to about $ 2.66 last month and is now hovering around $ Bankers said the effective devaluation would help curb imports by raising their prices. More than half of the residents of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> are in a sense imports themselves _ families from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, which is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, who fled as refugees from their homeland in 1948 and 1967 and were granted citizenship. Many went to work in the gulf during the oil boom of the late 1970s. They sent a total of more than $ 1 billion back to families in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, or through <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> banks to relatives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The other mainstay of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s economy, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> aid, has also been slipping.

Since 1982, the slumping oil market also has been responsible for the reduction in foreign capital.

 Astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> is happiest pondering the mysteries of the universe, but he has become embroiled in the more worldly affairs of politics by fearlessly speaking out against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s communist government. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, 52, has emerged as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top dissident by publicly championing democracy and questioning Marxism in this one-party state. `` We hope we have a good government, but there is no guarantee,'' says the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Observatory professor with the easy manner and impish smile. `` The only guarantee comes from people's pressure.'' `` I like to speak freely,'' he said in a recent interview in his airy <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> apartment. `` I think I just show ... we have the right of speech.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> emerged during pro-democracy student demonstrations that rocked major <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities in late 1986 and early 1987. Authorities said speeches he gave to students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION> helped incite the protests. When <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders cracked down on the protests, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and fired from his university post. The demonstrations died down, but <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> refused to be silenced. Since his purge, he has given a series of interviews to foreign journalists, criticizing one-party rule and claiming Marxism is outdated and widely unpopular. No other Chinese of his stature has dared to publicly launch such attacks on the system. During a summer visit to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> mentioned rumors that many Chinese leaders and their children maintained foreign bank accounts. Chinese authorities, reportedly displeased with his statements, subsequently withdrew permission for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later this year. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said he does not regret any of his comments and will continue to speak out. `` I'm a soldier who already crossed the river,'' he said. `` There's no way to turn back.'' Authorities are reluctant to allow <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to speak before an audience, even on non-political topics, he said. At an informal gathering on the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus to mark the school's 90th anniversary in May, he was treated like a hero by several hundred students who came to hear him speak on science and democracy. When <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was leaving, a crowd formed around him and students thrust forward books, envelopes, handkerchiefs and even money for the professor to sign. Letters of support come to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> almost daily from around the country. He says they encourage him to continue his activities. The last person to embody support for democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, a former electrician at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail in 1979 on charges of supplying military secrets to a foreign power and agitating to topple the Chinese communist system. The government, however, generally has attempted to show leniency toward <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> in an effort to improve the country's image. When reporters last year suggested his apartment on the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus was too small, authorities immediately gave him new quarters about twice the size. `` They want to use me. I know that,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. `` On one side they do n't like me, they criticize me. -LRB- On -RRB- the other side, they want to show they are open.'' The official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Review </LOCATION> in May published a lengthy feature on <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and other official media ran articles about his scientific work. But the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> says Chinese publications recently were instructed not to mention the professor's name. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was born to the family of a postal clerk in the southern coastal city of <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> and was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1952, at age 16, to study physics and nuclear reactor theory. He became one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pioneer researchers in laser theory and won international attention with his research in cosmology, the study of the universe. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said his break with Marxism began over cosmology. According to the professor, former Politburo member <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiaomu </PERSON> had questioned the need to study cosmology since Marxism already maintained the universe was infinite. `` This is an open question right now,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. `` In cosmology, Marxism is not right.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> lives with his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, a professor of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and the younger of their two sons in an apartment about 780 square feet in size _ huge by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> standards. A poster of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> hangs near the entrance and the apartment has a new personal computer and a video cassette recorder _ both rare items in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who earns $ 73 a month, receives $ 2,688 a year for research. He devotes much of his energy to writing scientific papers, and the 14 published this year include `` Physics and Beauty'' and `` Why Does n't the Universe Go Into Heat Death?''

<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American medical school in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> has fallen on hard times in the five years since invading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops evacuated its students and flung the once-obscure school into the news. St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, whose students President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said were saved from becoming hostages of a Marxist government, is still turning out doctors on this lush tropical island at the southern tip of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The 11-year-old private school now boasts 1,390 graduates licensed in 45 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states, and clinical training programs at hospitals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But as one of several so-called offshore schools in the region catering to to students rejected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical schools, St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s is straining from a steep decline in the overall number of young people going into medicine. Since the invasion of October 1983, enrollment at the school's two <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> campuses has plunged from 480 to 226 It has cut its work force from 120 to 90 and put expansion plans on hold. Tuition has nearly doubled _ to $ 17,000 a year from $ 8,700 in 1983. A few years ago, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s accepted only one of every 10 applicants. Now it's taking one of every two. `` The caliber of our students has declined; I'll be candid about it,'' Chancellor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Modica </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` But the American medical schools' pool of applicants has gone down.'' Despite the fall in enrollment, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>'s still has 33 full-time professors, down just two from 1983, and 44 part-time visiting professors, down four. Officials say the school is in no danger of closing. `` There's no thinking in that respect,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Massolo </PERSON>. `` It's alive and kicking, and we intend to keep it that way.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical establishment has long denounced St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s and other offshore medical schools as `` diploma mills,'' but teachers and adminstrators say <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s students are highly motivated and score well on qualifying exams `` My kids get as good training in gross anatomy as they can get anywhere in the world,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anatomy </ORGANIZATION>, who held the same post for seven years at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We could sell diplomas,'' he said, `` but a diploma does not permit you to practice medicine. You still have to take board-qualifying exams.'' <PERSON> Modica </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer, founded St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s at the age of 29 after being rejected by four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical schools and spending a fruitless year in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> trying to become a doctor. The school grew steadily but attracted little attention until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to overthrow a radical pro-Cuban junta that seized power and murdered left-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. In justifying the invasion, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the students at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, most of whom were Americans, were in danger of being taken hostage. They were evacuated in army helicopters by some of the 6,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and paratroopers who landed on the island Oct. 25, 1983, along with a token <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> force. A stately bronze monument bearing the engraved signatures of the 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen killed in action reminds visitors St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s main campus on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was once a war zone Initially, school officials strongly opposed the invasion, saying <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s rulers assured them the students would not be harmed. But within days, they changed their minds. <PERSON> Modica </PERSON> says today that he was briefed at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and shown documents of discussions within the revolutionary government that persuaded him the students might have been taken hostage. `` After the briefing, I felt that there was some justification for military action,'' he said. `` It was a close call, and I would n't have wanted to make the decision.'' <PERSON> Modica </PERSON> said enrollment peaked around the time of the invasion and has been falling for the past 2 -LCB- years. The reason, he said, is the medical profession, with its long, hard years of training and costly malpractice suits, has become much less attractive to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> graduates over the past decade. Applications to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical schools have dropped from 42,624 in 1974 to 28,123 last year, with the biggest decline occurring over the past four years, according to the Asssociation of American Medical Colleges. As a result, the nation's 127 accredited medical schools are opening their doors to students who just a few years ago would not have qualified, officials say. And that has shrunk the pool of applicants for schools like <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s.

 <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> wants the good people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 4th Congressional District to think of him every time they hear <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name _ a strategy many Republican hopefuls are pursuing this year. White, 34, a city councilman from <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, is trying to oust freshman Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> in a district that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee is expected to sweep. So White's speeches and advertisements are studded with references to the vice president and, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he repeatedly pledges to oppose tax increases, protect jobs and battle illegal drugs. `` Every Republican south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is linking himself to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. Maybe so. But on the eve of what national polls indicate is likely to be a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, few people expect either candidate to provide much of a boost to more than a few House hopefuls. Politicians and observers unanimously expect the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to remain solidly Democratic, whatever the presidential race's outcome. And they agree that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins and if he pulls <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> contenders to victory at all, it is likely to be in only a handful of races scattered across the country, mainly in the conservative South. `` As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does better, it helps the image of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, in whose state there are four tight <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races. `` But in the past we just have n't seen coattails that significantly in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' For the coattail effect to work, a presidential candidate must be so appealing that he draws large numbers of people to the polls who dutifully vote for other candidates of the same party. But in recent decades, strict party-line voting has been going the way of candidates who lack blow-dried coiffures. Beginning with President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s re-election in 1956, more than one quarter of the country's 435 House districts have voted for one party for president and the other party for its representative. In 1984, such ticket splitting between the presidential and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates occurred in 196 districts, or 45 percent. `` Most House races are pretty insulated from the presidential election,'' says spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The reasons are many. Increasing numbers of voters identify themselves as independents, and often decide congressional races on local issues, not national ones. And incumbents of both parties usually enjoy insurmountable fund-raising advantages and represent districts drawn to maximize their re-election prospects. Not only do most <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents seeking re-election win these days _ the success rate was 98 percent in 1986 _ but they are doing it so convincingly that they are usually invulnerable to defeat by their party's presidential candidate. Two years ago, nearly nine out of every 10 incumbents were re-elected with at least 60 percent of the major party vote, putting them far out of range of the 1 or 2 percent vote swing that a strong presidential candidate can bring to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> contenders on his ticket. `` For there to be coattails this year, it would have to be in a race that's very close and in an area where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will do very well,'' says <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> who studies voting behavior. `` We're talking about a pretty minimal impact there.'' Political pros on both sides say about a dozen such races do exist. Besides the contest between White and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> _ who mentions <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name as infrequently as possible _ others where presidential coattails might help are Republican <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s bid to oust Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 5th District; GOP Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON>'s fight to hold off <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> 3rd; and Democrat <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s fight with Republican <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to retain an open Democratic seat in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> 14th. But even though Republicans might pick up a few seats this year that may be attributed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory, it is possible that for the first time since 1960, the party that wins the presidential race might suffer a net loss of seats in the House. That is largely because while the 70 contests considered reasonably close are split evenly between Democratic and Republican seats, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> holds 15 of the 27 open seats that are not being defended by an incumbent. Open seats are where turnover from one party to the other is most likely. It is even possible that in a losing effort, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might still help Democrats in tight <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, including Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>'s effort to retain his 1st District <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> seat against Republican <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON>, and Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Donchess </PERSON>'s fight for the open <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s 2nd District against Republican <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost 20 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats when President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was elected in 1960, the party of the winning presidential candidate has picked up seats in the chamber every four years. Since then, the presidential year swings have ranged from the 38 seats the Democrats won in President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s 1964 victory to the two Democratic pickups that accompanied President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s 1976 triumph.

 <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s defense publishers today expanded its series with a new volume on riot control, counter-insurgency weapons and equipment to detect and protect against terrorist action. `` The amount of effort and research being put into the defense of every realm against traditional threats is dwarfed by that going into the defense of the realm and the populace against the terrorist, the insurgent, the freedom fighter or the guerrilla under whatever color of ideological cloak,'' editor <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> says in his foreward to `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Security and Counter-Insurgency Equipment.'' The new book by the respected defense information publisher lists equipment in five categories. The firearms section includes standard infantry weapons as well as guns for specialized security tasks. Operational equipment includes land, sea and air vehicles, surveillance aids such as night vision goggles, thermal imagers, explosives detectors and robots to set off discovered bombs. The riot control section lists a wide range of tear gas devices, stun grenades, plastic bullets and fragmentation grenades. Armor and protection includes bulletproof vests, flak jackets and even a bulletproof undershirt that wo n't be conspicuous under a business executive's shirt. The fifth section covers, transmitters, receivers, a fingerprint identification system, security fences and laser barriers. Not only does the terrorist `` have new types of ideology,'' <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> says, `` they are familiar with new types of weaponry and in their ranks are people to whom technology is simply a better method of vanquishing their enemies.

 Fearing their father could not raise enough money for their dowries, four sisters in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> committed suicide, Indian news agencies said. The sisters hanged themselves with their saris from the ceiling of their house at <LOCATION> Alappulli </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The four young women were concerned about the financial problems their father, a police constable, had after providing a dowry for their eldest sister, the news agencies said. The sisters _ <PERSON> Santha </PERSON>, 25, <PERSON> Sumati </PERSON>, 23, <PERSON> Anaka </PERSON>, 21 and <PERSON> Sasikala </PERSON>, 18 _ took their lives Friday while their father was away on duty and their mother was working in the family's rice paddy, according to the reports. Last February, three sisters between the ages of 18 and 22 hanged themselves over dowry problems in the northern state of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> outlawed dowry in 1962, the practice of paying the groom's family is still widespread. Many marriages are still arranged by families before the bride and groom ever meet, and there are frequent reports of young women being set on fire by in-laws in dowry disputes that continue after the weddings. Such `` kitchen fires'' are reported almost every day by Indian newspapers. Last year, the government reported 1,572 cases of the crime, which is known as `` bride-burning.''

<HEAD>VA Expansion Will Cost More Than $9 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Changing the Veterans Administration into the Department of Veterans Affairs may be relatively cheap as government programs go, but officials say it will still cost upwards of $ 9 million over the next decade. Much of that money will go for new signs and stationery for the government's fifth-largest agency, according to officials from the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. But `` given the relative size, the cost impact is n't expected to be significant, particularly in any one given year,'' said <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> analyst who helped develop the cost projections. When the new department comes into being next March 15, it will be little different from the current VA, according to <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a spokesman for the agency. `` I do n't think much has to be done before March 15. The essential duties have not been changed. The biggest difference is that the head of the agency will now be a member of the Cabinet,'' he explained. The agency wo n't move from any of its more than 500 buildings around the country, nor will its operations be greatly affected. `` Really, except for the different name and what that requires, we'll be the same as we are now,'' he explained. `` I do n't think you will see changes day to day.'' What is required by the name change are new signs _ thousands of them _ along with stationery with the new name. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has a $ 30 billion annual budget, much of which is disbursed in payments to the nation's veterans. There are about 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents of veterans or survivors, although only about 2.5 to 3 million use VA services on a regular basis. The bill creating the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> as the 14th seat in the Cabinet was signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Oct. 25, shortly after it had been given overwhelming approval by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Veterans organizations had long had the bill at the top of their legislative agenda and said moving the agency into the Cabinet would elevate the status of veterans. The VA is estimating a cost of $ 9.8 million for the switch, including $ 8.5 million for signs and the rest for changing stationary and the names on veterans publications. The signs will have to be changed at the more than 500 VA buildings around the country, Day said. The VA is still trying to figure out just exactly how many new signs it will need. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> does n't plan to change all its signs or buy new stationery right away, Ms. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said. `` We tried to find out the number of signs, but they did n't have an exact figure at hand.'' `` As the old stationary runs out, they will buy new stuff,'' she said. Similarly, the signs will be redone over the next five years. During the congressional debate over changing the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s status, some legislators said the total cost might be $ 33 million, far higher than the $ 9.8 million figure. But that estimate was for a different bill, which would have substantially expanded the staff of the agency's inspector general department, the office which guards against wrongdoing. The bulk of the additional money would have gone to hire new staff members, Ms. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said. Those provisions were dropped.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> each promise to cut the federal deficit if elected president, but their proposals for new programs could put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deeper in debt, economic and political analysts say. Each candidate has described or endorsed plans covering areas from defense to child care that could total billions of dollars in increased spending if adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without offsetting cuts in other spending. `` These guys are going in the opposite direction,'' said Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> and Presidential Studies at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're talking about spending money rather than saving money.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, senior fellow in economic studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, cited `` the failure of both candidates in my view to deal responsibly with the deficit problem.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have expressed concern about the budget deficit, which was $ 155 billion in fiscal 1988, which just ended. The national debt, under $ 1 trillion when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, is now more than $ 2.6 trillion. Concerns about the deficit's potential effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and global economies played a role in last year's drop in world stock markets and led to an agreement between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit spending. <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit remains one of the main concerns to foreign investors, who now are loaning the money to pay for more than half of the debt and are concerned about the security of their funds. `` They do n't have very many other places to send their money, but they're wondering if they'll ever get their money out of this situation,'' said <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosters </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said new programs could be adopted without increasing the budget deficit if other programs are cut, but `` not painlessly, and not without political conflict, certainly.'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said he thinks pressures in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will keep any new programs small and have them `` self-financed'' by eliminating tax benefits or cutting other programs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would cut some nuclear weapons, but his pledge to build up conventional arms could prove `` very costly,'' said <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing both the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles, but acknowledges he can not afford to press ahead with both. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is naive to let the Soviets know in advance what missiles he will eliminate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals include a $ 3.7 billion `` Invest In Our Children'' package aimed at children of low-income families that would help provide day care, more pre-school education and better health care. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsed the concept, but not the exact dollar amount, of the $ 2.5 billion `` A Better Child'' day care bill that failed to win approval in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. It would set federal standards and funnel money to states to expand day-care slots. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to spend $ 100 million on prenatal health care that he claims would pay for itself in a year because infants born under the plan would be healthier and require less hospital care after birth. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also wants to require all but the smallest employers to offer basic health insurance to workers and their families _ a move he says will cost the government nothing, but which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says amounts to a new tax of at least $ 35 billion on those businesses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says his plan would insure 22 million of the nation's 37 million uninsured. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said that over time it would reduce tax revenues because it would shift some income from the taxable category to the untaxable fringe-benefit category. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposes a reduction in capital gains taxes, which would benefit people with investments in the stock market and elsewhere, at a cost estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3.9 billion a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims the tax reduction would free up money for more private investment, creating jobs and stimulating the economy; thus, in the end it would work toward reducing the deficit, because the government would have more people paying taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vows he would adopt `` no new taxes'' and claims he would eliminate the deficit by putting a `` flexible freeze'' on government spending to keep total growth at the inflation rate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he would increase enforcement of tax collection and would raise taxes only as a last resort. But `` they're just not going to get that much more money out of it,'' said <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>, adding that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has already increased the number of agents pursuing tax cheats.

 A barrage of pre-election polls has given <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a lead for popular votes in the presidential contest and an even greater advantage in the more critical race for electoral votes. With Election Day looming, a 50-state poll by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> put 25 states firmly in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column and another 16 leaning his way. Only the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was firm for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Though the poll did not jibe with all other individual state assessments, it assigned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a daunting lead: His 25 firm states alone would provide more than the 270 electoral votes needed for election. In national popularity, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 10-point lead among likely voters, 54-44 percent. Gallup found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> up by 12 points, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said nine points and a <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> poll said 11. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polls found a closer race, with a 5-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead. The differing results indicated continuing indecision and dissatisfaction among some voters, factors that can accentuate the effect of differences in polling dates and methods, such as identifying likely voters. There was room for movement: One in five respondents in the Gallup and NBC-Journal polls were undecided or said they could change their minds, and in Gallup's poll only about half of each candidate's support was strong. Gallup, however, said its undecided respondents appeared likely to split evenly, on the basis of their background and ideology. Voter dissatisfaction was clear. Two-thirds in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll said the campaign was one of the worst in recent history, as many were unhappy with the nominees' discussion of the issues and six in 10 said they wished other candidates were running. As it was, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led in most ratings on presidential ability. Likely voters by 62-25 percent said he would be better able to maintain a strong defense, and he outranked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on crime, the economy and foreign policy. The ABC-Post's state-by-state poll underlined the difficulty of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position: He needed to win all his firm and leaning states, all the tossup states, all the leaning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> states and at least one firm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> state. The poll, conducted by re-interviewing most of the respondents in a 50-state survey in early October, found 17 states moving toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and only three moving toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The number of states firmly or leaning for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> actually declined from eight to four. The results did not agree with all recent state polls. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was rated as leaning to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for example, although a recent state poll put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slightly ahead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state also was said to be leaning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although a poll there last week put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead by 10 points. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> conducted five separate state polls, finding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 54-45; in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 58-42; and in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 53-46. It was about even in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 51-48 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 51-49 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Although the other new national surveys were not large enough for state-by-state results, Gallup found the race tight in the East and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading strongly in all other regions, particularly the South. The closer NBC-Journal poll found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading well in the South and West with tight races in the East and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In popularity nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll found a slight decline from a 13-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead late last month. The other polls Sunday also found some tightening, although they disagreed on its extent. The ABC-Post poll was weighted to an effective sample size of 1,500 likely voters for the national popularity figure, with a margin of error of plus or minus three points. Margins of error varied state-by-state, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> made characterizations of the state results without releasing numbers. In addition to the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> firmly for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it said <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> were leaning his way. Tossups were <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Leaning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The rest were rated as firm for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and the Journal polled 1,721 likely voters Tuesday through Saturday; Gallup, 1,969 Thursday through Saturday; <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 2,114 Wednesday through Saturday; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, 1,585 Friday and Saturday; <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today-CNN 2,506 nationally and about 500 in each of the five states, Thursday through Sunday. The Gallup and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polls had margins of error of plus or minus two percentage points; the NBC-Journal and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> polls, three points; the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> polls, two points for the national sample, four for the states. In addition to the ABC-Post finding of 54-44 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the numerical results were: <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today-CNN, 55-44; Gallup, 53-41; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, 51-42; <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 50-45; NBC-Journal, 48-43. All included leaning voters except the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll; including them, its result was 50-45.

 Despite a decline in smoking, annual spending by Americans on cigarettes is climbing and probably will continue to do so through the rest of this century, says an Agriculture Department economist. `` Manufacturers will face falling domestic volume and will need to raise prices to maintain profits,'' <PERSON> Verner </PERSON> <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said. `` Tax rates of state and local governments will continue to rise. The need for additional tax revenues is mounting, and tobacco taxes, especially cigarettes, have been a mainstay of state revenue systems for many years.'' <PERSON> Grise </PERSON>, who specializes in tobacco analysis for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that in addition to federal and state taxes `` a growing number of local jurisdictions are looking to the same revenue source. Reporting in the agency's latest <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said there have been dramatic changes in the last decade. `` Spending for cigarettes is double what it was 10 years ago,'' he said. `` But the rise reflects higher prices, not more use. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption has fallen 10 percent from its peak of 640 billion cigarettes in 1981. Retail cigarette prices, on the other hand, have risen about 90 percent since 1980.'' Most of the increase has been from higher manufacturer and wholesale prices, and from the boosts in taxes. Prices go up to maintain or enhance profits as well as to cover rising manufacturing costs. Last year, <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said, Americans spent about $ 33.5 billion on cigarettes, a little more than 1 percent of consumer disposable income and approximately the same proportion as 10 years ago. Cigarette excise taxes totaled about $ 9.7 billion in 1987, compared with $ 6.6 billion in 1980, he said. Federal taxes accounted for 49 percent, with state and local governments the remainder. But looked at another way, total excise taxes only accounted for 29 percent of consumer expenditures on cigarettes in 1987, down from 34 percent in 1980. <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said that although taxes rose, the marketing bill for manufacturing, distributing and merchandising cigarettes increased faster. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had an excise tax on cigarettes since 1862, <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said, and since 1969 all states have imposed such taxes, along with an increasing number of local governments. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was the first state to impose a cigarette tax in 1921, and by 1950 40 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were taxing cigarettes. Rates now range from 2 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ the leading producer _ to 38 cents in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said that makes a weighted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average tax of about 18 cents per pack. `` The increase in spending on cigarettes in the 1980s has largely gone to manufacturers,'' he said. `` The farm value of cigarette expenditures was actually $ 100 million less in 1987 than in 1980.'' Tobacco farmers in 1980 received 7.5 cents of each dollar spent by cigarette users, but in 1987 growers got only 4 cents, <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said. `` Meantime, the manufacturer's share -LRB- of each dollar spent -RRB- rose from 35 cents to 44,'' he said. `` The distributor's share stood at 24 cents in 1980 but retreated to 23 cents in 1987.'' Federal excise taxes edged to 14 cents of the consumer dollar last year from 13 cents in 1980. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, federal taxes accounted for up to 35 cents of each cigarette dollar. <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said state and local taxes rose to more than 20 cents of each dollar in the 1970s and early 1980s but dropped to about 15 cents in 1987. Of about $ 33.5 billion spent on cigarettes last year, <PERSON> Grise </PERSON> said the farm value was approximately $ 1.35 billion; the manufacturing share, $ 14.9 billion; wholesaling and retailing, $ 7.62 billion; federal taxes, $ 4.73 billion; and state and local taxes, $ 4.95 billion.

 Democrats are confident they will keep their controlling grip on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> no matter which party wins the White House in Tuesday's election. Party organizers even hope to chip away at <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, perhaps bolstering their 54-46 majority by one or more seats. Republicans, however, say the momentum is turning in their favor in races across the country, while conceding that every tight race will have to break in their favor if they are to stand even a chance of regaining the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> control they lost two years ago. Strategists in both parties say an unusual volatility in the electorate this year adds an element of uncertainty that could lead to election-night surprises. As the campaign moved into its final hours, GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in states in which polling has given Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wide margins over Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have moved to identify themselves with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his political themes. Political money flowed freely. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reported that as of Oct. 19, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates of both parties had raised a total of $ 157.5 million. The most expensive race in the country to date: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., spent more than $ 10 million and Democratic Lt. Gov <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> spent more than $ 5 million. The race was a tossup on the eve of the election. Overall, it appeared to be a good year for most incumbents, who attracted the lion's share of campaign contributions. In many of their races it appears to be a case of no contest. Most of the 15 Democratic incumbents seeking re-election appear to be safe, cushioned by leads of 10 or more points. Only three of the 12 Republicans seeking further six-year terms appear to be in trouble. Among Democrats, late polling showed Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, pulling ahead of former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> after weeks of harshly negative campaigning. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., was locked in a head-to-head contest with rival Republican <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> with <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> recycling television ads featuring talking cows from his 1982 campaign In this case, the cows call <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> a `` greenhorn'' who would be out of his depth in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Among Republican incumbents, strong challenges are being mounted for the seats held by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb.; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> appeared headed for defeat, while <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> were battling down to the But much of the action revolves around three of the six seats being vacated by retiring senators, three Republicans and three Democrats. There are clear favorites in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> is widely expected to capture the seat being vacated by one-term Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., the House Republican whip, is favored to take the seat of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most senior Democrat, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, who is And Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., is favored to win the seat of retiring Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt The three others _ in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ are tossups, and may contain a key to the final outcome of the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, millionaire businessman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the Democrat, has outspent Republican <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, the minority leader of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and held onto a shrinking lead despite criticism he has never before held public office. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was locked in a tight battle with Democrat Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> for the seat being vacated by Democrat <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. A dead heat for the seat being left by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., has developed between former GOP Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> has run a series of negative ads, including one accusing <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> of voting `` against the environment'' in his previous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> The Gorton camp retaliated, recruiting <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> for a television spot in which he accuses <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of distorting <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>'s record and tells him: `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, you've been spreading so much stuff I've had to change my shoes.'' The camera then pulls back, the picture widens and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, dressed in a three-piece business suit, displays dirt-splattered work boots. Viewing the horseraces, Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strategists saw it this way: Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>: `` The Democrats will hold 54 seats at a minimum and I believe have a very good chance to add ... There is a unique volatility in the electorate.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>: `` We are probably more enthusiastic about our chances now than at any point in the cycle. We think the momentum is going our way almost across the board. But we will have to win all the close ones. ... But it's still quite volatile out there and we could still end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as easily be plus two or better.''

<HEAD>French Voters Approve Plan For New Caledonia, But White Islanders
Vote No</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French voters have approved a program to grant more autonomy to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and permit an independence referendum in 1998 on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory, but turnout was light and many white islanders voted no. The government of Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> is hoping the statute, which passed Sunday, will buy 10 years of peace in the islands that have suffered from intercommunal violence since 1984. The statute includes a development program for native Melanesians. With all votes in except from a few <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> territories, 80 percent of the vote was in favor of the new statute and 20 percent against. Turnout, however, was a mere 37.3 percent, the worst showing for any national election since the end of World War II. The archipelago of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, 11,000 miles from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, has been rent by periodic violence between the native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and white European settlers. Kanaks, most of whom favor independence, make up 43 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 inhabitants. The settlers, most of whom want to remain French, are 37 percent. The rest of the population is made up of Polynesians and Asians, who generally favor <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. After another round of violence last spring that left 25 people dead, <PERSON> Kanak </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON>, leader of the anti-independence forces, signed an agreement with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on the island's future. Tjibaou and <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> demanded a referendum to seal the deal. But <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> did not get strong national backing for their plan. Only 14.5 million of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 38 million voters cast ballots. And of them, 13 percent cast blank or invalid ballots. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> itself, turnout was much higher at 63.7 percent, but the approval much less. `` Yes'' received 57.03 percent and `` no'' 42.9. The opposition vote was largely in the south, where most of the European population lives. In <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the capital and white settler heartland, 63.7 percent voted against the plan. `` Democracy has spoken,'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said after the polls closed. `` It appears that 12 million French have just approved the statute. This statute is from now on the law of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor Steps In To Save Dog</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 125-pound <PERSON> Great </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> named Cinnamon has Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> to thank for a reprieve of sorts that allowed it to stay with its family. An insurance company had told <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Slack </PERSON> they either had to get rid of the dog or stop operating a day care center in their home. Branchville-based <ORGANIZATION> Selective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> told the Slacks a large dog like Cinnamon might endanger young children, <PERSON> Mrs </PERSON>. Slack said Sunday. `` Basically, their hands were tied,'' she said of the company. `` They did n't have much choice as far as the law is concerned.'' She said no other insurance company would talk to them about a day-care policy except Selective, and the family had to think of a solution. The family needed the money from the day-care operation to help pay the mortgage on their new house, Mrs. Slack said. Her husband is a pastor. Faced with the thought of life without Cinnamon, their daughter, 11-year-old <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>, wrote a letter to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and started what has become known as the `` Cinnamon Affair.'' A week later, the Slacks received a letter from the governor's office, which said they could expect to hear about the case in a few days, Mrs Slack said. But <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> grew impatient, called the office and was told that her case had been sent to a higher state official. A few days later, Mrs. Slack said, the family received a personal phone call from <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who told them a compromise had been worked out and they could keep the 3-year-old dog. The family will have to keep her in a kennel in the backyard when children are being cared for. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> placed a few calls to state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Merin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Selective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executives, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, the governor's press secretary. `` Here was a case that the governor felt was something that he could involve himself in and hopefully bring it to a successful conclusion, which he did,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said, who added that <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> is a long-time dog lover.

 The third-ranking leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was arrested at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport on Sunday, authorities announced Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, capital regional commander, said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON>, allegedly the party's deputy secretary-general, was planning to board a flight for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He was on his way to the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. `` It is possible that he is being projected into the international commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.''

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the report did not say whether the woman was arrested. <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was carrying documents identifying him as a `` Mr. <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>.'' Military officials have claimed rebel representatives are raising funds among Filipino expatriate communities abroad to finance the 19-year-old Communist insurgency. <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was carrying travel documents identifying him as a `` Mr. <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said that following the arrest, troops raided a suspected rebel `` safe house'' early Monday in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and seized bank books, computer diskettes and other records. <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said he reported the arrest to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has vowed to crush the rebel movement before her term expires in 1992. <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was the highest-ranking member of the party to be arrested since secretary-general <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylosis </PERSON> was captured in March. He was believed to be a member of the party's ruling <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and central committee. He was also chairman of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luzon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which directs rebel operations in the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was the seventh member of the central committee arrested this year, according to the military. Longtime party leader <PERSON> Rudolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON> was arrested in September 1986. Last month, a Philippine court issued an arrest warrant charging that the founder of the party, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, had resumed its leadership. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> was jailed in the 1970s but released by Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in March 1986.

 Starring in a new movie about rape brought back nightmares for actress <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, who says she was raped, sodomized and beaten in 1982 by two men who broke into her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. Miss <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> spoke about the ordeal in this week's People magazine. Her new film, `` The Accused,'' is strongly reminiscent of a gang-rape in a bar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where bystanders allegedly watched and cheered. She plays the assistant district attorney who prosecutes the bystanders. The 31-year-old actress says she turned down the role of the victim, which went to <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, `` because I have been a victim in real life and had no need to re-create it on screen.'' After filming `` The Accused'' and hearing two rape victims tell their stories, she decided to go public with her own story. `` I thought that my not talking about my own experience was the most cowardly act of my life,'' she said. `` I do n't think I'm going to change the world, but if I can make the difference in one person's life, then telling my story has been worth it.'' Two men were arrested. One served more than three years in prison, charges against the other man were dismissed for lack of evidence.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is calling Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the frightening candidate'' for president, saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has no foreign policy credentials. Answering questions Sunday as he entered the homestretch of the 1988 campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was offended by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' suggestion that he would be unfit to head a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> crisis management team in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has absolutely no experience in foreign policy. The only foreign policy he's had is conversing with the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator struck back at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a day after the Democratic standard-bearer said the notion of Quayle involved in sensitive national security matters was `` a frightening thing.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scheduled a tour of a Westinghouse plant near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> today before flying to <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for a rally and then to his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was rounding out his campaign with an appearance in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. He planned to dine privately with family and friends in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> tonight, cast his ballot and return here Tuesday night to await the election results. While carrying out a modest campaign schedule consisting of an appearance at the historic <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Sunday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked at several points if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign organization was intentionally giving him a low-profile schedule in the campaign's waning days. `` I think you probably better unfog your glasses,'' he told a bespectacled reporter who raised the question. `` I'm right here. We're very versatile, very flexible. We go to good ones -LRB- solid Republican states -RRB-, bad ones -LRB- Democratic states -RRB- and in between. Wherever they say.'' The question was raised because <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in recent days has made appearances in mostly small media markets and, with the exception of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, states considered safely in the Republican column. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> trip, said that sending the senator into traditionally strong Republican states is part of a strategy, not to hide <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, but to have the senator work to keep <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> backers from taking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election for granted. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s ire was raised by statements that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made in response to questions in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview. The governor was asked about what he thought about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suggestion, in an interview with British television personality <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, that he would put <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of a crisis management team, if elected. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` In charge of managing the most serious crises we face in the country That's a frightening thing, is n't it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, standing next to his plane before commencing his campaign activities Sunday, snapped back. `` Well, the frightening thought is President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He is truly the frightening candidate. ... He's the one that's truly frightening in the area of foreign policy in any kind of crisis.'' Asked what he would do if put in charge of a crisis management team in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said only, `` Same thing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a similar assignment early in his administration in a move that contributed to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s resignation as secretary of state There has been little definitive record of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did in that capacity, although he has been credited by some in the administration as having played a principal role in overseeing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said last week he thought he could be a valuable foreign policy adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of his service on congressional foreign affairs committees. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, appearing with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at a campaign rally in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, credited the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator with helping to get the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Divorce lawyer <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> may be a hotshot attorney in the fictional legal world of television's `` L.A. Law,'' but his real-life peers say they would n't want to invite him to join their group. After a panel discussion titled `` <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> _ How Real is He?'' members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matrimonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> voted 50-14 against the notion of extending an invitation to <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> to join their association. The hypothetical matter came up Saturday at the start of a four-day meeting devoted mostly to weightier issues, such as custody and surrogacy, and the economic hardships that no-fault divorce have caused some women. But <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, president of the academy, credits <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s character with raising awareness of the legal specialty However, he said it's impossible to know whether the character actually has influenced members of the profession. `` The character is bigger than life, but not unreal,'' said <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. `` And we're up closer than most people. We see the warts and freckles, we understand many of the things he goes through. I suppose the jury is still out, to what extent the portrayal has helped.'' Among those sitting in on the <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> panel was <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, an `` L.A. Law'' story editor and producer who writes <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s character, played by actor <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` I'm not comfortable thinking about <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> or any other character strictly as a role model, because dramatically, that's too limiting a standard to hold him to,'' said <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, an attorney who put aside his practice while working on `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' `` Like everybody else, <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> has different sides, some heroic and some anything but heroic. <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> has done things that if someone I knew in real life had, I'd say, ` What a jerk!' `` By the same token,'' <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> said, `` he's done some things I greatly admire. And in this company, in dress, behavior and other measures, I'd say he's basically middle of the pack. There are a fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON>.'' Needless to say, the vote probably wo n't affect <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s television following Besides, fictional characters can not join the elite academy, which is comprised of only about 1,000 of the nation's 40,000 divorce lawyers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, has about 16,000 members. Despite the turndown, one thing <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> still has going for him is the perception that `` L.A. Law'' has not only glamorized the business, but has encouraged more young people to enroll in law school. `` Enrollment is definitely up,'' said <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, `` but I do n't know whether that means I get the credit or the blame.

 The football practice field at <ORGANIZATION> Columbiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is choked with foot-high grass this fall because financial problems have sidelined the football squad and other extracurricular activities. `` We do n't have a student newspaper, we do n't have plans for a yearbook, we do n't have any sports.

Senior <PERSON> Sheli </PERSON> <PERSON> Farran </PERSON>, who has played on the basketball, volleyball and softball teams, said the loss of high school activities has left <ORGANIZATION> Columbiana </ORGANIZATION> teen-agers without much to do in their spare time in this rural village of 4,900 residents near <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>. `` It seems like you just come here, you go to school, and then you go home and you have to find your own thing to do,'' she said. `` There's a movie theater, but you can only see the same movie so many times ... really there's nothing for the kids in this town.'' School districts on the East and West coasts generally have avoided such cuts because of strong local economies, but in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where regions are suffering from stagnant economies, cuts in sports, music and drama are more common, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have had the southern oil-producing and -LRB- midwestern -RRB- agricultural areas show sharply declining property tax revenues, which presents the schools with less money to spend on activities,'' he said. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said there are also efforts in some states to mandate a limit on property taxes, thus reducing the amount of money available to schools. Columbiana school officials first made the cuts in 1986. But a group of parents raised $ 92,000 to cover the cost of the threatened activities through last school year, paying for coaches, sports equipment and a choir director with the donations, <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> said. `` The whole time they were saying, ` This is a one time shot for us, we ca n't do this again, so we need your support and we need this levy passed,''' he said. <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> said the average homeowner in the district pays $ 600 to $ 650 in property taxes to the schools, which he said is about average in the state. `` I guess what we have here is a real division in the community between people who want those activities and people who either do n't care or do n't want them,'' <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> said `` Folks who do n't have kids or whose kids are n't involved do n't really see that as a part of education, I guess.''

<TEXT>
 Partisans of 29 statewide propositions Californians face Tuesday spent a record $ 130 million _ more than $ 9 a voter _ on a media war involving issues like car insurance rates, AIDS and raising cigarette taxes. More than half the spending has centered on five conflicting propositions aimed at revamping the auto insurance rate-setting process and lowering premiums. Insurance companies alone, fearing a budding `` car premium revolt,'' poured more than $ 60 million into the battle, and trial lawyers' groups spent $ 15 million, making it the most expensive single campaign in the country outside a presidential race. `` This is the most massive financial attempt in corporate history to buy votes,'' said consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, chief supporter of the proposition that would cut auto rates the most. Other hotly contested initiatives would raise cigarette taxes by a record 25 cents per pack, override Republican Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s veto of a state worker safety program, and tackle AIDS issues. Elsewhere Tuesday: <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> will decide whether to keep a 6-month-old law effectively banning cheap handguns; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> will tackle the issue of abortion financing; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> will decide tax limitation proposals. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> voters will vote on whether to declare English their states' official language; and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters will consider the toughest statewide smoking ban in the nation. Insurance companies have tried to convince <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters that the only real hope for rate relief would come from Proposition 104, which would create `` no-fault'' auto insurance and cap attorney fees. Insurers have condemned the rival Nader-backed Proposition 103, which would cut rates 20 percent and impose government regulation. They also have criticized a rival measure backed by lawyers to cut auto premiums by 20 percent for good drivers and prohibit limiting lawyers' fees. Despite the insurers' blitz of television commercials, polls showed voters favoring the Nader-backed measure. But a large undecided vote left the outcome unclear. If two or more of the measures pass, court battles may produce some unintended hybrid. California Proposition 102, backed by tax revolt champion <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>, would require doctors to report people who have AIDS to county public health offices. It would also allow people charged with certain crimes to be tested for the deadly disease without their consent. The measure has been opposed by state health authorities. <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>, who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1982 from a blood transfusion, and other supporters argued that they were tired of watching public health sacrificed in the name of civil rights. Proponents received a boost late in the campaign when <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> endorsed the measure. A second AIDS measure would allow people charged with certain crimes to be tested for AIDS without their consent. Supporters claimed the measure would help protect victims of sex crimes, police and firefighters. But critics argued it could give victims a false sense of security. Polls indicated voters leaning toward adopting both AIDS measures. The tobacco industry spent $ 18 million to defeat a measure that would raise cigarette taxes 25 cents per pack and use the money for research and health care programs. But polls indicated the initiative could pass by a slim margin. Health experts argued in their low-budget campaign that the measure would discourage smoking; the industry called it an unfair tax that would trigger a crime wave by encouraging cigarette smuggling. California Proposition 97, meanwhile, would in effect override <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s veto in 1987 when he wiped out the private-employer portion of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Occupational Safety and Health Act program, known as Cal-OSHA. To supporters, including labor groups, the $ 7 million program axed by the governor was the nation's finest worker safety system, far more effective than its federal counterpart. To <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, it was a wasteful state bureaucracy that duplicated federal efforts. Polls indicated voters may pass the measure. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ballot has been stretched even further by hundreds of local measures across the state. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> voters must wade through 25 additional propositions, including two involving the basing of the USS Missouri, the battleship on which the Japanese surrendered during World War II. An advisory measure in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> supports Palestinian self-determination. The lengthy ballot prompted some counties to announce they would apply a 10-minute limit on time spent in voting booths in order to avert long lines. That prompted a challenge by civil rights groups, who on Friday won a temporary restraining order from a federal judge. But on Sunday the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overruled the lower court and approved the 10-minute limit.

<HEAD>Forcibly Retired Colonel, A Powerful Haitian Figure, Dies
Mysteriously</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ One of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most powerful men, a colonel indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges who until recently led the country's most feared army unit, has died under suspicious circumstances, a family friend says. Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who was forcibly retired Sept. 30 as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, died about 3 p.m. Sunday of a heart attack in his home in suburban Fermathe, Radio Haiti-Inter said. He was 49. The independent station gave no other details, but a family friend said there was speculation the 29-year army veteran was poisoned. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s maid and gardener were detained by police for questioning, said the family friend, who would not be identified further. In addition, the colonel's former wife, <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON> <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>, was taken to the <LOCATION> Petionville </LOCATION> police station for protection because of fear of reprisals by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s relatives, the friend said. The military government's spokesman, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, said he had no information on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s death. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clude </PERSON> also said she had nothing. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was stripped of his command after a Sept. 17 revolt by noncommissioned officers ousted <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. The coup leaders, who said they were outraged by state-sponsored murder under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, replaced him with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and ousted about 60 of the army's most repressive commanders. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> at first appeared allied with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, but the new leader reportedly became concerned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> might turn against him. Last month, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said he planned to close the barracks of the 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, the most brutal unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,000-member army. The unit has been linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the hated private army of the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship, and some of its members have been blamed for widespread violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised after a popular uprising drove <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> into exile in February 1986. The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the cancellation of independently run general elections last November, leaving at least 34 people dead. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had been a powerful force in the army, which has run this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation for most of its 144 years. The barracks of his former command are adjacent the presidential palace. In March, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The soldiers who ousted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said they wanted to name him army chief but decided not to because of the drug charges. Haitian and diplomatic sources later said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s retirement could help lead to the renewal of a $ 70 million annual aid package the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off after the November 1987 election massacre. The drug trafficking indictment alleges <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> conspired to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1986. It says the traffickers used a landing strip on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s farm 90 miles outside <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the capital, to load and fly the shipment to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON>, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who later defected, told Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. in a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that 70 percent of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s troops were involved in drug <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a military junta that assumed power when <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An attempt to dismiss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in June failed and led to the fall of the civilian government of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who had won military-run presidential elections in January. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had tried to reassign <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to an administrative post, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> refused and was backed by <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> on June 20, accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> remained head of his battalion. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not intervene when soldiers overthrew <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in September. The soldiers who formed <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s new government have said they want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for elections.

 Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, hurling allegations of unethical conduct, has battled to a dead heat against Republican Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, and kept up the attack in an eleventh-hour gubernatorial debate. Turning around a question on education Sunday, the millionaire communications executive said: `` I think you ought to start educating our children on the need for honesty and integrity in state government. Ethics _ it's taught in the sixth grade.'' <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is one of 12 states selecting governors Tuesday. Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the office in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ are on ballots. The gubernatorial race here is the most expensive in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> history, with each candidate spending about $ 2 million. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, 68, has contributed $ 1.9 million out of his own pocket. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> by a landslide in 1986, robbed the two-term governor of an early, commanding lead by raising questions about <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s private business deals, alleged favoritism in the awarding of state contracts and the hiring last month of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster for a state job. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, 54, has stressed the state's economic recovery in his four years in office, citing increased spending on education and day care and challenging <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> on Sunday to say what he would do differently. He has also accused his opponent of business misconduct and mismanagement. A WLNE-TV poll Friday and Saturday gave <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> 44 percent to 43 percent for <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. A WPRI-TV poll Wednesday and Thursday gave <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> 47 percent to <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>'s 46 percent. Both surveys had margins of error of roughly 5 points. `` We've seen all this negativeness and I think that adds a new dimension to the undecided vote,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political science professor <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. `` They're not going to be able to resolve their indecision because neither of the candidates has given them a reason to vote for them.'' Pollsters said undecided voters were relying on Sunday's hastily arranged, televised debate to help them make up their minds, but neither candidate took the experts' advice that <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> talk issues and <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> confront the ethics questions. `` We're here today to talk about issues,'' said the governor, accused by <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> of using his political influence in a family land deal that netted him $ 400,000. `` I think the public is fed up with your mudslinging, quite frankly.'' <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>, who has attacked <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> for increasing spending 45 percent, appeared nonplussed and had to grope for an answer when <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> asked him, `` What would you cut?'' The Democrat said he would stop hiring outside lawyers for state business and reduce spending by the governor's office. Elsewhere, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a Republican, trailed far behind Democrat <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>; Democrat <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, the son of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, led GOP Lt. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> erased a 30-point deficit to draw even with Democrat <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is barred by law from a third term; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> are retiring. Other states holding gubernatorial elections are <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court cleared the way for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> election officials to put a 10-minute limit on each person's time in a voting booth, saying there was no evidence the cap would be rigidly enforced. The 9th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Sunday that a lower court's temporary restraining order blocking at least three counties from applying some measure of the 97-year-old law was unjustified Appeals Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> wrote that the statute had not previously been enforced rigidly or in a way that unduly restricted the ability to vote of people who do not speak English as their primary language. `` The court has rightly recognized that this standard that has been in use for nearly 100 years is an appropriate reminder to the voter,'' said Chief Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. He added that `` no elections official is going to reject any bodies from the booths,'' but many instead could now diplomatically tell voters Tuesday to complete ballots as quickly as possible. The issue was raised when <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> counties announced they would use the law to speed people through voting because of an unusually long ballot with 29 statewide propositions and anticipation of a record turnout. Civil rights groups challenged the limit. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilar </PERSON> ruled in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> that the time limit amounted to a literacy test, which is outlawed by the federal Voting Rights Act. The appeals court did not rule on that issue, saying it could be decided in a trial. In arguing for the limit, Deputy State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said long lines could discourage voters from entering polls, effectively disenfranchising them for the sake of those with language difficulties who do not take advantage of absentee ballots. `` We're concerned that if people think there is no time limit, people will tarry, will take all the time they can get,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had said earlier. The lawsuit challenging the limit was brought on behalf of Hispanic and Asian minorities by the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> chapter and the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> of the legal defense fund argued Sunday that requiring non-English speaking voters to transfer ballot choices from a second-language sample ballot mandates `` a certain level'' of literacy. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>'s deputy county counsel, said voting that way requires only basic mechanical skills. After the ruling, <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said it indirectly validated his concerns. `` It says what we've been saying, that in the absence of any history of this being rigidly applied in the past, if business continues as usual, with no strict, literal enforcement, then there's no problems,'' he said. A record 10.5 million people are expected at the polls, or 75.2 percent of registered voters, according to Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Man Asks For Prison Term, Says County Jail Too Dull</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 20-year-old man told a judge he wants to serve time for car theft and forgery in prison because the county jail is too boring. `` I ca n't sit that long in the county jail because it will drive me crazy,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Couture </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing to do. If I go to prison, I can go to school, I can get a job, go to work camp.'' Couture asked <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> on Friday to delay his plea on three counts of forgery until after Couture is sentenced in <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on a car theft charge. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Prosecuting Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said Couture wanted to plead guilty to the car theft charge first so that sentence will be added to his forgery sentence. Sentences over one year are served in state prisons, less than a year in a county jail. Public defender <PERSON> Crad </PERSON> <PERSON> Verser </PERSON> told the court that the <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor will recommend that Couture be sentenced to two months in jail for the car theft. The standard range the court could impose is two-to-five months. On the forgery charges, the most Couture could get is under 12 months, which would mean jail time. But with the sentences from both counties added together, Couture could be sent to prison, for 12 to 14 months. Couture said he fears that if he had to languish in jail, he'd be so restless he'd end up back in court on other charges before completing his sentence. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> accepted the two attorneys' recommendations and delayed Couture's arraignment on the three forgery counts until January.

 <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> has a suggestion for all spurned lovers, tyrannized employees and anyone who's had an especially bad day: do n't get mad, get even. And she'd be glad to help. Her month-old business `` Enough is Enough,'' billed as `` creative revenge for today's world,'' has already mailed a three-foot dead bluefish to a philandering husband in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and delivered a burned and messy suit to a lawyer who implied his girlfriend was `` unsuitable'' for him. More common requests among those wronged, however, are the 13 dead roses, sent in a beribboned black box -LRB- $ 25 -RRB-, or 13 black balloons tied together by a single dead red rose -LRB- $ 30 -RRB-. Other `` insults to suit the occasion'' include a real stuffed shirt -LRB- $ 25 -RRB- for pompous bosses and drinking glasses with cigarette butts on the bottom for obnoxious smokers. `` Twenty years ago, people did n't speak up the way they do now,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` But since the'60s, people have expressed themselves. And with me, you really have a way to vent things out.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, 43, was inspired to start `` Enough is Enough'' after a year spent driving a florist delivery truck for a boss she said was the `` grumpiest, most unpleasant person ever born.'' `` She never smiled, she was just miserable,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` I hung in there for a year but I was so sick of it. I thought _ I can get this same atmosphere by making a business out of it.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> financed her venture with $ 30,000, some of it from her husband, a businessman. She prowled bargain-basement department stores and gift shows for ideas. She brought back artifacts such as a cloth witch on a stick -LRB- for `` those witchy people on brooms'' -RRB-, porcelain pigs -LRB- `` for people on a diet'' -RRB- and real kites -LRB- to send those for whom you want to tell `` go fly a kite'' -RRB-. She buys her dead roses for $ 5 for several dozens at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and purchases other items in bulk. Her material is a combination of specialty store items from joke shops and objects she finds herself. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> is happiest fielding phone calls in her small office behind a florist, surrounded by boxes of wilting roses, black balloons, and buttons reading `` First of All _ We Kill All the Lawyers.'' She jumps up enthusiastically to point out another gag, like the cactus she recently bought. She plans to deliver it to an insufferable boor with the words `` sit on it,'' she said, laughing uproariously. `` Maybe after a while it wo n't seem so funny but now I ca n't help laughing all the time,'' she said. Since she opened her business, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> has received more than 100 calls and 30 people have paid for her services. She promises her customers that she wo n't reveal their names. `` I want to stress that we'll do anything, as long as it's legal,'' she said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> is most eager to coordinate more elaborate schemes. For people who want to play a prank on a boss, she has a plan in the works to move the boss's office furniture and to another part of the building. `` But we'll move it back during the day,'' she said. `` Most people we get are doing this stuff for a joke. They're not malicious.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s part-time staff consists of her 23-year-old son, her cousin and a friend. Her days driving a flower truck are a distant memory. `` We just sit around and laugh all day,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> arrived on his first journey outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, declaring himself a free man and speaking out for a supporter jailed over a protest on behalf of the Nobel laureate nearly eight years ago. The human rights activist told reporters at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday night that dissident mathematician <PERSON> Vazif </PERSON> <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON> was imprisoned after staging a one-man protest on his behalf and now faces additional charges. `` I feel it is my duty now, at this moment, to remember this man and many others who remain in prison,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his defense of human rights, is scheduled to spend two weeks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> visiting relatives, undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization. The trip comes less than two years after he was freed from internal exile in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, where he had been sent because of his outspoken opposition to the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Using stepdaughter <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> as a translator, the tall, balding 67-year-old spoke for about 10 minutes but refused to answer questions. He appeared rumpled and tired after a 14-hour flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Two years ago, I became a free man when I returned from <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. `` Now I have become even freer because I have been granted the right to travel around the world. `` But a man who staged a one-person demonstration on my behalf in January 1980 when I was exiled to Gorky remains in prison. The name of that man is <PERSON> Vazif </PERSON> <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON>. He has been charged once again with a very serious crime and faces a long imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON> was a cellmate of <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who was deported in 1986 for his human rights work. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said last May that <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is traveling without his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who saw him off with a kiss at <LOCATION> Sheremetyevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He was starting his trip with a visit to her daughter by a previous marriage, Mrs. <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON>, and their two teen-age children in suburban <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is expected to visit Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Alekseyeva </PERSON>, and their 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>. It will be his first meeting with his granddaughter. He is also scheduled to undergo a heart examination and may receive a pacemaker at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> had cardiac bypass surgery at the hospital in January 1986. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is expected to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he will participate in a board meeting Nov. 13-17 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>, the first such session outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The foundation, formed in January by Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists and educators, is embarking on a worldwide campaign to raise $ 10 million for research on global problems. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Sunday he believed `` my country ... and your country can do a great deal together for peace, for a world that is happy and close and without hunger, violence or disease.'' He said that since childhood, he has had a great deal of respect for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is `` indeed a truly great country.'' The granting of an exit visa for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a dramatic example of the changes in Soviet society since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The foundation also played a role in obtaining the visa, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, president emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and the foundation's vice chairman. `` The foundation's position was not to meet outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> unless all the board members could attend, and that meant the Soviet government had to change its position and give -LRB- <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> -RRB- permission to travel,'' <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was a top Soviet physicist and helped develop its hydrogen bomb in the 1950s, but became a dissident leader in the 1970s. He was exiled to <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, a city about 250 miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in January 1980, a month after the Soviets invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. His wife was banished to Gorky in August 1984. They remained there until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called them back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986. Earlier that year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had told a French newspaper <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could not travel outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because he knew too many state secrets. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has continued his scientific work, and now concentrates on the origins of the universe. He speaks out occasionally on human rights issues.

<HEAD>Hit-And-Run Driver Surrenders: `I Didn't Know What I Hit'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man has surrendered after more than two years of keeping his identity a privileged secret and has given an unapologetic confession to fatally running down a drunken man on a dark beach road. `` I did n't know what I had hit,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> restaurateur, said Sunday after he was charged with leaving the scene of the March 9, 1986, accident in which <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> was dragged 60 feet to his death. `` I realized I had run over something that was not a garbage bag or not a bag of rags,'' <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> said. `` It all happened very quickly. What could I do at that point?'' <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> for being in the road in the middle of the night. <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, 28, had a blood alcohol level of 0.26 percent, more than 2 -LCB- times <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s legal intoxication level. `` If there is a jury that wo n't agree with that, then I'm living in the wrong country,'' <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> said. `` I feel like I have been the one taken advantage of, not the one lying on the ground.'' The hit-and-run accident in posh <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> gained national attention because <PERSON> Morser </PERSON>'s identity had remained a secret behind the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality. The day after the accident, the driver contacted attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON> and asked him to keep his identity secret and negotiate a plea deal, which fell through. `` I was not about to walk into a police station and say, ` Hey fellas I'm raw meat, come and get me,''' <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> said Sunday. On Oct. 13, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> upheld <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON>'s right to keep the client's name secret. Meantime, <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>' parents appealed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 60 Minutes'' for information that might reveal the driver's identity and had offered a $ 1 million reward contingent upon them winning a lawsuit from the driver. Investigators first suspected <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> on Thursday after inspecting his white <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riviera </ORGANIZATION>, which resembled the car that struck <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>. Police also learned that <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> had recently moved out of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> apartment that he had been renting from <PERSON> Kirscher </PERSON> since before the accident, authorities said. When investigators interviewed <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> on Friday at his restaurant, he appeared nervous and gave evasive answers, authorities said. <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> was ordered to the appear Saturday at the prosecutor's office, where authorities say he admitted he was the driver who struck <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> was booked Sunday on the felony and released without having to post bond. `` His identity was discovered, it was confirmed he was my client and I was called by the state attorney's office to produce my client for a compelled statement,'' <PERSON> Kirscher </PERSON> said. A subpoena had been issued to compel <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> to talk about the case, <PERSON> Kirscher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> was given immunity in exchange for his statement about <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>' death, the attorney said. The immunity means prosecutors will not be able to use <PERSON> Morser </PERSON>'s statement against him in court and must find other evidence to prove <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> was behind the wheel of the car that killed <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kirscher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> and her ex-husband, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who had filed a $ 6 million lawsuit against the unknown killer of their son, said they were relieved the mystery was over. `` It's been costly both financially and emotionally,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She said she has spent $ 50,000 going back and forth to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> leading the efforts to find out who hit her son <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> told reporters Sunday the family was in it only for the money and he has been the real victim. Mrs. <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> said that's absurd. `` He gambled and he lost and he is trying to make us out to be the bad guys,'' she said. `` I happen to believe in justice for everybody. My son is entitled to justice even though he is dead.''

<HEAD>Safety Officials Concerned About Preflight Cockpit Chatter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some federal safety officials who have investigated two fatal airliner accidents are concerned that pilots may not always be focusing on the business at hand in the critical moments before takeoff. Federal investigators at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are closely examining the tape covering nearly 30 minutes in the cockpit of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 last August before the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 crashed seconds after takeoff, killing 14 of the 108 people aboard. More than half of the tape, covering a lengthy taxi period at the huge <LOCATION> Dallas-Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, involves idle chatter among the pilots and two flight attendants on subjects ranging from the recent purchase of a house to birds nesting near airports. Nearly 11 minutes of the tape were omitted from the transcript because they were considered irrelevant, including a reference, according to sources, of news reports a few days before the crash of chatter aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that crashed in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> 10 months earlier. If there is an accident, one participant in the Delta cockpit reportedly reminded his colleagues, their words might end up in the newspapers, too. Later, the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plane's captain told investigators he did not care for the lengthy presence of the flight attendants in the cockpit, but that it was not his nature to order them from the cockpit during the long takeoff delay. Investigators emphasized that so far there has been no clear evidence linking these conversations _ some of which was technically legal because the plane was not moving _ with the possible cause of the crash. But investigators are trying to determine whether the flight crew forgot to properly set the jetliner's wing flaps, which help it gain lift, and whether the conversations distracted them from preparing the plane for flight. An exchange lasting 7 minutes and 42 seconds between co-pilot <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and a senior flight attendant began as the crew was going through one of the preflight check lists. Finally, the exchange was cut short by Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, prompting an apology from <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> about `` sittin' here talking to the flight attendant,'' according to the transcript. Later flight engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> told investigators he had been uneasy about the attendant's lengthy presence. While there is no link established between these discussions and the accident, some <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators are uneasy about the casual and relaxed demeanor the exchanges reflect. Furthermore, several aviation safety officials not involved with the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> investigation suggested such extraneous discussions before takeoff are common. `` It's very difficult to legislate against people interacting in a job situation,'' says <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Foushee </PERSON>, an aviation safety researcher at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foushee </PERSON> said while some casual exchanges may help a flight crew feel at ease and work together, there also have been numerous pilot complaints received through <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s anonymous aviation reporting system over the years about pilot distractions, including inappropriate conversation and untimely presence in the cockpit of flight attendants. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> in its final report on the Nov. 15, l987, crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> also raised concerns about idle chatter in the cockpit. That crash, which killed 28 people, was attributed to the pilot taking off in snow with ice on the wings. Four minutes before takeoff, the two <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots `` engaged in almost three minutes of nonpertinent social conversation'' _ reportedly involving a flight attendant _ which `` would suggest inattention to more important details'' such as the weather and its effects on icing, the safety board said. Since l981, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has had a `` sterile cockpit'' rule that prohibits any conversation among flight crews not related to the operation of the aircraft when the plane is taxiing and in motion, and when flying below 10,000 feet in an approach or departure. Flight attendants also are specifically prohibited from entering the cockpit during those periods. The requirement was prompted by concerns at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> about an unusually high number of cases in the late l970s, including several accidents, in which pilots were distracted from their duties by idle chatter and other requirements such as making cabin announcements during `` critical phases of flight.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and other aviation officials concede they have no idea how often the rule is ignored. Violations are uncovered only if an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspector is aboard _ at which times chatter is unlikely _ or after an accident when the cockpit tape is reviewed. But federal officials note that even if a violation is shown and the flight crew members survive an accident, there is likely to be no <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary action because the contents of the cockpit recorder tape can not be used either in court or as part of administrative action by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of unions representing pilots and flight attendants acknowledged that at times the sterile cockpit rule may be violated, but they said for the most part it is widely adhered to. Lengthy delays before getting takeoff clearance adds to the problem, they suggest. The long delays `` gives a very murky definition of when -LRB- the cockpit -RRB- is sterile and when it is not,'' says <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, calls idle chatter in violation of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule `` the exception, rather than the rule'' and suggested such conversation _ when not in violation of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules _ may add to smooth aircraft operation.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s vital signs stabilized today, one day after his most serious loss of blood since falling ill seven weeks ago with internal hemorrhaging, an imperial palace spokesman said. The 87-year-old <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who has received almost daily blood transfusions since he first coughed up blood Sept. 19, received 4.66 pints in emergency blood transfusions Sunday, spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. Also today <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s second grandson, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after he was called back from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the second time since the emperor took ill. Aya, 22, is studying at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> He returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the end of September for nine days when <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition took a turn for the worse, and his latest return was expected to fuel concern over the fate of the bedridden emperor. The world's longest-reigning living monarch was `` in stable condition for the time being,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters. But `` doctors fear he may bleed again,'' he said. `` His temperature and other signs are stable,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said, but did not give the figures. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received the transfusions Sunday because of `` considerable'' amounts of blood lost during intensified hemorrhaging, palace officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted palace sources as saying the emperor discharged 56 ounces of blood Sunday. With the latest transfusions, the emperor has received a total of 40.16 pints of blood since September, more than three times the blood circulating in his body. Doctors believe the emperor is bleeding in the upper intestinal area, where he underwent a bypass operation in September last year. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s systolic blood pressure, which fell below the critical level of 100 at one time Sunday, later recovered slightly but was still well below the 150-point level of the past few days. The emperor's blood pressure was 116 over 56 this morning, compared with 122 over 62 Sunday evening, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was `` awake and fully conscious'' in his room at the Fukiage Palace, and had not discharged any blood today, the spokesman said. Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has pancreatic cancer. `` We still do n't know the exact nature of the illness,'' said a senior palace spokesman, but `` the illness is clearly progressing'' for the worse. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, has assumed imperial duties that include placing an official seal on government documents and meeting visiting dignitaries. Under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s constitution, the emperor _ who was once worshiped as a god _ is a symbolic head of state.

 Motorists paid slightly more for gasoline during the past two weeks because dealers passed on short-term cost increases, an analyst says. The average price of gasoline for all grades and types of services, including taxes, rose .2 cent a gallon to $ 1.0023 a gallon between Oct. 21 and Nov. 4, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. It was the first increase since the end of the summer driving season, she said. The Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations nationwide found the following average prices for self-service, which accounts for most gasoline sales: Regular unleaded, 90.77 cents a gallon; premium unleaded, $ 1.0606 and regular leaded, 87.28 cents. Full service prices were $ 1.1958 a gallon for regular unleaded, $ 1.3013 for premium unleaded and $ 1.1666 for regular leaded.

 A student suspected of unleashing a `` virus'' into an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide tried frantically to warn operators after discovering his experiment had gone awry, associates said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, a first-year student in <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s doctorate computer science program, is suspected of creating the computer virus that last week clogged the computers tied to a military network. He has been unavailable since discovery of the virus Thursday. His father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a government computer-security expert, said his son left the university Thursday to avoid reporters. The senior <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has refused to say whether his son created the virus. The electronic virus, so named because it multiplies after invading a computer, jammed computers across the country linked to the Pentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers by reproducing itself over and over. But affected centers reported the virus only took up memory space and did not destroy any files. `` It could have been a whole lot worse,'' said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozen </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' instructors. `` He could have wreaked a lot more havoc. I ca n't believe it was malicious. Mischievous, yes.'' Friends of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> quoted today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> created the virus as an intellectual challenge and that the virus was supposed to lie dormant in computer systems. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose Wednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering his mistake, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus' spread `` His machines at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION> were so badly clogged he could n't get the message out,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedell </PERSON>, an assistant professor of computer science at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did his undergraduate studies. Panicked, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> called <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>, systems manager at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aiken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. He asked <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> to send urgent messages to a computer billboard, explaining how to defeat the virus, <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The nets -LRB- computer networks -RRB- were like molasses,'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> said. `` It took me more than an hour to get anything out at all.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> officials said Sunday they have no absolute proof that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> caused the virus. But the evidence in the university's computer system so far points to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, they said One <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sunday that it appeared there was an early version of the virus in <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' computer files. The elder <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the episode will `` clearly raise the awareness of the existing vulnerabilities, particularly of network systems.'' The father has written widely on the security of the Unix operating system, the target of his son's virus program, and is widely known for writing a program to decipher passwords, which give users access to computers. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said Sunday his son planned to meet with a lawyer today and would not be available for comment until Tuesday or Wednesday. `` He's concerned, obviously,'' said the father, reached at his home in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, Md. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which is investigating whether any computer crime laws were broken, have not yet spoken with his son, he said. The programmer who designed the network's electronic mail program that the virus invaded said he had forgotten to close a secret `` back door'' to the program, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> said he created the opening to make adjustments to the program, but forgot to remove the entry point before the program was widely distributed in 1985. He was working for a programming organization at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> at the time. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a computer science graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and a friend of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, compared <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' exploit to that of <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, the young West German who flew a light plane through Soviet air defenses in May 1987 and landed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It's as if <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> had not just flown into Red Square, but built himself a stealth bomber by hand and then flown into Red Square,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told the Times.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> ended a dinner appearance in a shouting match with foreign journalists, calling them `` thieves and enemies'' and saying blacks do n't want British-style democracy. The hostile question-and-answer session followed his speech at the Saturday night banquet put on by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work instead of all the beauty, promise and good will,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said after an argumentative exchange with one journalist. `` You do n't understand <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. You do n't understand African aspirations. You do n't understand African history,'' he said. The 400 people attending included foreign and local journalists and their guests, such as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. `` Will you just sit down and listen to a man who has traveled through <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told a persistent questioner. `` Blacks do n't want a Westminster-style democracy,'' he said. `` Even if you could remove all the whites from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tomorrow ... what you put here will not work.'' After a prolonged exchange with one woman, he said: `` I do n't want to quarrel with beautiful ladies I do better things with them.'' He wondered out loud whether one questioner had `` psychological problems.'' Asked about the white minority government's suspension last week of the anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he supported the move. He described the newspaper as one of the most `` vicious'' he has seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to `` more violence in this country.'' At the end of the hourlong impromptu debate, the host offered to thank <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but the foreign minister refused to accept. Instead he returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>, a 19th century South African politician. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>'s -RRB- opening words were, ` friends, citizens, thieves and enemies.' And that is how I look at you this evening,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The audience responded with boos, hisses and shouts of `` go home!'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> left shortly afterward, before dessert was served. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s media restrictions have been further tightened under the 29-month-old state of emergency. The emergency regulations prohibit reporting on security force actions, most forms of protest and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement has not been comprehensive.

 Moslem guerrillas surrounding this southern city say they are running low on weaponry while <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> supples new warplanes and missiles to the Marxist government to repel the guerrillas' advances. One guerrilla leader says some fighters have acquired satellite-guided <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mortars but supplies are limited and some of the weapons were destroyed by Soviet bombings. Soviet-Afghan forces defending <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city 300 miles southwest of the capital <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, bombed the area in the past week with newly introduced Soviet MiG-27 jets, the guerrillas said The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the Afghan army killed more than 300 guerrillas near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and other areas from Friday through Sunday. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, reported that guerrilla attacks killed 33 people in the same period, including 30 it said died when a missile hit a bus near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. The Soviets said last week that they have suspended their troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and have sent advanced weapons to their southern neighbor because of unrelenting pressure from the anti-communist guerrillas known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. Among weaponry newly introduced in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> are SS-1 Scud missiles, which are capable of reaching <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, 120 miles away. U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft Stinger missiles that once sent Soviet fighter jets fleeing to higher altitudes are in short supply and jealously hoarded, said guerrillas in the <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> area. `` The air is the only trouble for mujahedeen,'' not military installations on the ground, said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>, a guerrilla commander in the area. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> sits in the middle of an arid plain that offers little protection from marauding aircraft that have leveled the city's southern suburb of <LOCATION> Mahalajat </LOCATION> The MiG-27s, first supplied by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> around Oct. 23, drop their bombs without decoy flares, used before a raid to fool heat-seeking missiles. `` They must know they have nothing to fear anymore,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition he not be identified. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalai </PERSON>, a guerrilla commander, said he examined satellite-guided mortars at a base south of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and run by the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. Non-guerrilla sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have also confirmed the four-barrel, 120mm weapons were supplied to the insurgents. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, has denied receiving any foreign aid and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to publicly acknowledge the weapons' existence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Guerrillas who used their limited technological expertise to describe the mortar, said a satellite acts as a spotter, sending coordinates to the launcher, which is equipped with a screen and a small receiver. Mujahedeen fighters fire two rockets in the direction of the target, and the satellite does the mathematical equation that locks it in. There was no word on the mortar's range. However, the insurgents say supplies are limited and two of the mortars were destroyed when the MiG-27s blasted rebel positions east of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> airport late last month. In the latest fighting, guerrillas reported heavy bombing around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> during the past week that killed at least nine people and injured 80. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that guerrillas on Sunday fired three rockets into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> but did not say if there were any casualties. It said that over the weekend the Afghan army killed 153 guerrillas in fighting around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and in the settlements of Tur-Kotal and <LOCATION> Sarpuza </LOCATION>. It said troops attacked an `` armed gang'' in <LOCATION> Zabol </LOCATION> province, killing 150 guerrillas and wounding 52 people, including a Pakistani adviser. Under terms of the U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords reached in April, the Soviets agreed to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it sent into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979 to help the Moscow-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government fight off the guerrillas. About half the troops have been pulled out. But on Friday, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it halted the second half of the pullout that was to be completed by Feb. 15.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> celebrated its 71st anniversary today with a traditional display of military might on Red Square, and the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat attended for the first time since the Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The parade commemorating the Bolshevik Revolution took on less of a political character than in past years of higher international tension. Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> criticized Western defense policies in a short and comparatively mild speech, and banners displayed on the square had an almost exclusively domestic, economic character. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> walked onto <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s Mausoleum and acknowledged the applause of the crowd alone at the center of the reviewing stand. In contrast to previous years, the other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo followed far behind them. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> stood on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s right throughout the parade, a possible indication that he has moved up in the party leadership. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a conservative who formerly was regarded as the No. 2 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, stood next to <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, an indication he has fallen in the hierarchy. All 11 Moscow-based members of the Politburo attended the gathering marking the anniversary of the seizure of power by the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> in 1917. The annual event is often one of the clearest indicators of changes in the hierarchy. Some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most sophisticated military technology, including SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles, T-72 tanks, anti-aircraft weapons, armored personnel carriers and rocket launchers followed. Western diplomats said there were no new weapons. Thousands of soldiers, diplomats and spectators jammed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s main square under blustery, leaden skies A light snow fell, the temperature was just below freezing and Red Square was adorned with a giant red-and-white portrait of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and political slogans. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires, was at the parade, said <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. It was the first time the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> attended the Revolution Day parade since the Soviets sent soldiers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> was out of town and would have attended had he been in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Ambassadors of other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries also attended the parade. Their return reflected the agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> April 14 under which half of the 100,000 Soviet soldiers have been withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the remainder are to leave by Feb. 15. However, fighting continues in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday said it was suspending its withdrawal because of continuing attacks by Moslem rebels. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> reviewed the soldiers and sailors on Red Square and delivered a relatively mild message criticizing Western military policies. `` The destruction of medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons has just begun, yet already there are calls for all kinds of compensation, modernization, the build-up of conventional arms and the stepping up of the ` Star Wars' program,'' he said. Following the speech, divisions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top soldiers began the traditional parade through Red Square, past <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s Mausoleum. Thousands of people began gathering in the early morning cold hours earlier. Music was piped into streets that had been closed to traffic and marchers gathered on main thoroughfares carrying pink and yellow balloons toward Red Square. They followed the soldiers and military vehicles onto the square with slogans such as `` War on Bureaucracy,'' and others supporting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for economic reform.

 On a desolate, nightmarish landscape strewn with rubbish and guarded by the barren, gnarled skeleton of an old tree, sits a shabby, soiled man. He is joined by an equally dirty and desperate companion who attempts to make some sense out of their existence in this inhospitable environment. We are in the uncertain, often bleak, often funny world of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, and the two men _ <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Estragon </LOCATION> _ are `` Waiting for Godot,'' a mysterious person who never does arrive. It's the only thing you can be sure of in <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s enigmatic masterpiece which opened Sunday in an all-star revival at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>. `` Star'' is the operative word in this production and the reason the revival is sold out for the rest of its run which ends Nov. 27. It's no accident that each of the play's two acts starts with a drum roll and clash of cymbals. This `` Waiting for Godot'' has two of the country's biggest comic talents _ <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> _ playing <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s memorable tramps They are joined by Academy Award-winning actor <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and clown <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> as the archetypal master and servant <LOCATION> Pozzo </LOCATION> and Lucky. <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> is the young messenger from the unseen Godot. What the austere <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> would make of them is anybody's guess, but the playwright's love of classic comedians is well known. After all, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> starred in the original Broadway production of `` Godot'' in 1956, and <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> once wrote a film script for <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>. This revival, directed in high style and plenty of show biz glitz by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, certainly has its quota of giggles, yocks and even belly laughs. At the production's last preview, theatergoers sounded as if they were lapping up <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s latest laughfest rather than <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s metaphysical musings. Many in the audience came for the stars, not the play, and they were n't disappointed. The scruffy <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, sporting a beard and shaggy hair, is a brilliant improviser and has a strong stage presence. His Estragon is a maniacal creature, verging out of control at times, but he can get a laugh out of the simplest of stage business, such as pulling off a boot or trying to eat a raw carrot. But he veers into some stage antics and line twistings that <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> never would have dreamed of _ giving hilarious imitations of such diverse cultural icons as R2D2 and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, complete with an improvised machine gun. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> should supply the stage manager with a net when things start to get too wild. The gray-bearded <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has a tougher assignment playing the subdued, almost straight man <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' more flamboyant Estragon. He does n't quite succeed. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is a bit bland, fading at times into <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s mesmerizing setting of white sand. His voice is colorless, too, rarely rising above a monotone. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> seems almost complacent and without that desperation needed to convey the author's sense of futility about life. The unnerving expression of that futility is left to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> in the secondary roles of <LOCATION> Pozzo </LOCATION> and Lucky. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> gives a bizarre, idiosyncratic performance _ with an odd Mafioso accent _ as the severe taskmaster. Still, he manages to spit out with the proper bitterness <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s lament about life. `` They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more,'' he says. It's a jolting note, considering all the laughs going on around him. The usually boyish <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, looking like an old man in superb makeup by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Helland </PERSON>, is sensational as the abused servant Lucky. The actor is an accomplished mime as well as a comedian. Every gesture has been carefully thought out, not only for the comedy, but for the pain that lies underneath the laughs. `` Godot'' straddles both comedy and drama as <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> tries to grapple with fundamental questions of human existence. At times, the play teeters on despair while making the audience laugh out loud. But <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' production pretty much gives up on the drama. And maybe it does n't matter. With this cast, `` Godot'' can be enjoyed at its most superficial and comic level, even though it rarely digs below the surface. In the published text of the play, `` Waiting for Godot'' is described as `` a tragicomedy in two acts.'' The Lincoln Center revival concentrates on the laughs _ and gets them. But by doing so, it loses the haunting loneliness and tragedy that also permeate the play. In other reviews, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> wrote: `` The virtue of <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' approach is that, unlike many productions where <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s austerity and somberness are heightened by actors' desire to make the work confusing and thus more profound, this ` Godot' is direct, accessible and entertaining. ... Even if the play rarely achieves pathos, its ending is haunting because of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s masterful lighting. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> wrote in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Post: `` <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> is quite wonderful in timing the production, in collaborating with his actors to hit every precise button as they come up ... This is an immaculate production that is a shade too self-conscious for its own perfection, but one which, in its care and precision, has been, like <PERSON> Godot </PERSON>, worth waiting for.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` The naked realism of ` Godot,' which belongs to no specific place or time but to all places and all time, does not suit a director whose gift is for comedy strongly rooted in contemporary social detail. Rather than expanding his artistic reach to meet <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s, -LRB- <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> -RRB- contracts the play to fit his own chilly esthetic. ... Audiences will still be waiting for a transcendent ` Godot' long after the clowns at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, like so many others passing through <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s eternal universe before them, have come and gone.''

<HEAD>Military Says It Captures Third-Ranking Communist Rebel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The third-ranking Communist rebel leader was captured at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport, where he may have been planning to board a flight for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> under an assumed name, officials announced today. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday's capture of <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON>, whom the military described as deputy secretary-general of the Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, shows that her government is winning its struggle against the 19-year Marxist insurgency. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, capital regional commander, said <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was captured Sunday in the parking lot of Ninoy Aquino International Airport. <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Cresteta </PERSON>, was arrested today during a raid on the couple's suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home in which police seized weapons, a personal computer and bank books for accounts totalling $ 75,000, officials said. `` He was on his way to the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> told reporters. `` It is possible that he is being projected into the international commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' Later, <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON>, 42, told reporters at a police station that he had gone to the airport to see off his father-in-law, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, who was on his way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> denied he planned to leave the country. Capt. <PERSON> Florenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON>, who made the arrest, said <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> dropped off his wife and father-in-law at the departure terminal and then drove his car to a nearby parking lot, where he was taken into custody. <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> said police were simply speculating that Capegsan intended to fly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> too because there was no other explanation for parking the car. Access to the terminal is limited to ticketed passengers. He said informants had told police Capegsan planned to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month, but canceled the trip. Military officials have claimed rebel representatives are raising funds among Filipino expatriate communities abroad to finance the insurgency. <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> said, however, that police found no ticket on <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> and that <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had confirmed reservations only for the wife and father-in-law. He said <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> may have planned to fly stand-by. <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> said police made no attempt to track down the wife and father-in-law inside the terminal. But Mrs. <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> returned home without boarding the flight and was arrested the following day. During a brief appearance before reporters, <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> claimed he left the rebel movement in late 1986, after nearly 16 years in the underground, because of fatigue and philosophical differences with other rebel leaders. Foreign reporters, however, saw him with rebels in December 1986 during a nationwide 60-day cease-fire. According to the military, <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> is the highest-ranking member of the party to be arrested since secretary-general <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylosis </PERSON> was captured in March. Authorities say <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> served as chairman of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luzon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which directs rebel operations in the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> told reporters he had been deputy chairman before leaving the underground. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has vowed to crush the rebel movement before her term expires in 1992, hailed the arrest. She told a meeting of Southeast Asian businessmen today that the capture was `` a very important development.'' <PERSON> Capegsan </PERSON> was the seventh suspected central committee member arrested this year. Longtime party leader <PERSON> Rudolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON> was captured outside a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hospital in September 1986.

 Former Philippine first lady <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to spend the night with her daughter before continuing home today to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, wife of former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, arrived at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday night aboard a jet belonging to tobacco heiress <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had been staying with Miss Duke in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> since pleading innocent to racketeering charges in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week. Miss <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, said to be an old friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, posted the former first lady's $ 5 million bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was spending Sunday night at the home of her daughter, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>, who lives in a suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and was to leave for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> sometime this morning, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON>, the No. 2 agent in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> office.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> honored Jews and the holy laws of the Torah in a Mass marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night of shatttered glass that ushered in the Nazi Holocaust. The Roman Catholic cardinal said more than human decency demands the world remember the Nazi atrocities. `` Otherwise we will be destroyed by the indifference that permits betrayers and killers to stalk the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said during a Mass on Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> has asked all 410 churches in the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to ring their bells Wednesday and parishioners to light candles on the anniversary. He said he would light a memorial candle in the window of his residence that night. On Nov. 9-10, 1938, <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rampaged against Jews in major cities as well as those in small towns in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` Let us remind ourselves of the depth of gratitude that we owe to our Jewish brothers and sisters who died, who lived, but ultimately survived, survived because they preserved the law,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, holding the Torah, or first five books of the Hebrew Bible, given him by <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders soon after his arrival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1984. The attack became known as Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, because of the shards of broken glass that littered the streets. It is considered the beginning of the German drive to exterminate Jews. An estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of others died at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> made the remarks during his annual Mass for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawyers and judges. He reminded the legal community of its duty to preserve the law. `` Is it any wonder that the first lawyers ... were awed by their tasks, that they were mandated to preserve the law, to copy the law, to teach the law, to interpret the law, above all to love the law,'' he said. `` Without the law the heart is ripped out of Judaism, the heart is ripped out of the world.'' Among those at Sunday's Mass were former Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanenbaum </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Yaffa </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliach </PERSON> of the Center for Holocaust Studies.

<HEAD>Actress Says She'd Like To Play Ordinary Housewife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actress Meryl Streep, know for adopting foreign accents for her film roles, says she would like to play someone who lives a bit closer to home _ a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> housewife with three kids. In her new film `` A Cry In The Dark,'' Streep adds an Australian accent to her repertoire. `` I get a lot of flak for my accents,'' she said. The actress said it's more exasperating than hurtful to handle critiques of her accents, such as the Polish lilt of the concentration camp survivor from `` Sophie's Choice,'' or the sing-song tones she used playing a Danish baroness in `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview published Sunday, she said she would like to portray someone like herself _ a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> housewife with three kids who organizes the neighbors to fight for favorite causes. `` I really would love to play a housewife with environmental concerns, but they do n't make movies about them,'' Miss <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> said. `` I do n't go looking for parts with accents, but I'm drawn to what hits me in the solar plexus. I need to engage on that level, to do roles that have something to say.'' The actress said her next project is to tranform herself into the title character of `` Evita,'' the musical about Argentine dictator <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s charismatic wife, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. She said the part has been offered to her, but filming wo n't start until October 1989 That will give her time for singing lessons to prepare. Another avenue Miss Streep would like to pursue is comedy. `` I just have n't gotten many comedies,'' she said. `` I'm a sucker for the powerful story. I could do the easy thing and not have to go and kill myself each time. I do n't know why I do, but it's the way I am.''

<HEAD>Baseball Fan Wants Ashes Scattered at Third Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Elane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sollins </PERSON>' last wish was to have her ashes scattered where her favorite baseball player could be found _ on third base at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Memorial Stadium. <PERSON> Sollins </PERSON> was an avid fan of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, especially former third baseman <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. She went to about 20 games a year, where her favorite seat was along the third-base line, and she listened to the rest of the games on the radio or television. Since <PERSON> Sollins </PERSON> died Oct. 25 at 63, her son has been pursuing her wish. `` She's been saying that for 20-30 years ... whenever <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> started playing,'' said her son <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalus </PERSON>. `` She was a big <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> fan for years, and third base is where her darling <PERSON> Brooksie </PERSON> played. I know it's an odd request, I know it's nutty, but odder requests have been made.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he did n't know <PERSON> Sollins </PERSON>. `` I've heard a lot of them, but this is a new one,'' he said. `` I'm flattered. I did n't realize how involved fans got with players until I got out of the game.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aymold </PERSON>, who works for the Loring-Byers funeral home, wrote to the city's director of parks and recreation for approval. If he goes along, the decision rests with the team. `` If there's any way to honor it, we're going to try,'' <PERSON> Kalus </PERSON> said. `` Before she died, she went straight to the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> with her request and was turned down. I understand that. But I just told her I would take it from there.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucchino </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, said he was staggered by the request, but said the team would be willing to talk to the city and family about it. If the request is denied, <PERSON> Kalus </PERSON> said he might take matters into his own hands. `` I'll show up at the stadium and talk to them myself,'' he said. `` I might even call <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> to see if he has any pull ... and there's always Camera Day, when fans are allowed on the field.

 A 24-year-old American, convicted on cocaine trafficking charges by a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> court despite attempts by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to have him freed, left today for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was sentenced to six years in prison in April after being convicted of bringing four pounds of cocaine into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in a false-bottomed suitcase. But once in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials could decide to grant <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> immediate parole because they believe he is innocent. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> has consistently denied any knowledge of the cocaine in the suitcase, a claim corroborated in a court deposition by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> man for whom <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was working as a freelance photographer at the time of his arrest. To obtain the transfer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had to agree not to appeal his conviction. He returns home under a 1983 treaty signed by <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that permits convicts to serve out their sentences in prisons in their home country. The <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government agreed to his request for a transfer during a weekly Cabinet meeting Oct. 28. Accompanied by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> boarded <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 903, which left <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a stopover in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. He left prison Sunday in a police van and spent the night at <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> police headquarters. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who worked as a 1984 summer intern in Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office and had been admitted to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was arrested March 13, 1987, on his arrival in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he had been shooting travel brochure photos on an assignment arranged by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>. In return for a suspended sentence on a felony cocaine charge and a promise from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that he would not be extradited to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal judge that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew nothing about the drugs and had been set up to carry the suitcase. His declarations also led to the indictment in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of three others in the plot. All three are at large. But the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> court that tried <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> refused to admit <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s deposition as evidence because plea-bargaining is illegal in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in February to sign a protocol for an extradition treaty with then-Justice Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON>, he told reporters he was handing over <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s deposition to <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON> in hopes the charges against <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> would be dropped. After <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s conviction, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said through a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman that he `` regrets very much this action by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> court. ... I think it's important to stress that we continue to believe ... in Mr. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s innocence, and we continue to hope that he will ultimately be exonerated.''

 Troops backed by helicopters and armored cars stormed a prison and killed 12 inmates today in crushing a rebellion by 1,500 convicts, authorities said. About 25 prisoners were injured in the assault by troops who threw tear gas and opened fire as two helicopters hovered over the medium-security Welikade Prison in suburban <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. Soldiers stood guard and smoke could still be seen more than two hours after the uprising was quashed at the prison, which generally houses inmates awaiting trial on criminal, rather than political or civil charges. Among the injured was a former navy sailor convicted of attempted murder for clubbing Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with a rifle butt two years ago, police said. Half the prison population of 3,000 broke out of their cells Sunday and staged a sit-in to demand better food, the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> and the dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The inmates took one guard hostage but released him early today, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They then set fire to furniture in four buildings behind the 20-foot walls around the prison complex and cut telephone lines, the police said. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the prison rebellion apparently was inspired by strikes and demonstrations being organized around the country by a radical Sinhalese group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front has accused <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, of making too many concessions to minority Tamils seeking autonomy. In southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, at least 153 prisoners tunneled out of a military detention camp Sunday, but 78 of them were recaptured, the government. Almost all the escapees from the Pelawatte camp had been detained on suspicion of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, blamed by authorities for more than 500 killings in the past 15 months. The camp is 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The front opposes the government's peace overtures for ending a five-year-old Tamil guerrilla war. Tamils, who make up about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, want an independent homeland in the northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They claim they are discriminated against by Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the people. In another prison protest Sunday, about 800 inmates in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, staged a clamorous demonstration from their cells. About 35 of them sat on the roof of <LOCATION> Bogambara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, waving red flags and demanding <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s resignation. The president has already said he plans to retire after new presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19. The injured inmates at Welikade Prison included <PERSON> Wijemuni </PERSON> <PERSON> Vijitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON>, who attacked <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on July 30, 1987, one day after <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed a peace accord designed to end a guerrilla war by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil minority. <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON>, a 23-year-old Sinhalese, was listed in serious condition, police said. <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> was a member of a military honor guard that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was inspecting when the sailor swung his rifle and landed a glancing blow on the prime minister's shoulder. In November 1987, a military court convicted <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> of attempted murder and sentenced him to six years in prison. <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> has appealed.

<HEAD>Israeli Coalition Agreement May Divide Jews In Israel, Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> may pay a high price for forming <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s next government if he drives a wedge between the Jewish state and the international Jewish community in the process. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is using a package of religious laws, opposed by many Jews outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as a bargaining chip to coax the religious parties into a Likud-led coalition. Jewish organizations overseas particularly fear passage of laws that enhance the power of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox Jews, thus devaluing the Conservative and Reform streams of Judaism to which many Jews abroad belong. `` This is a red line,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, head of the Israeli office of the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. `` This could do serious damage to the concept of Jewish unity and common destiny, and weaken the ability of American Jews to identify with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 parliament seats in Tuesday's elections, more than the 39 seats won by the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but not enough to form a government without the support of four small religious parties, which together hold 18 seats. Passing religious legislation could undermine the American Jewish community's political and moral support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and threaten the half-billion dollars <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gets in annual contributions from American Jewry. One of the ripple effects could be to diminish the power of the pro-Israeli lobby in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has a tremendous influence over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> $ 3 billion in aid each year. At the heart of the controversy is the so-called `` Who is a Jew'' law _ the law that defines who is Jewish and thus eligible for automatic Israeli citizenship. At present, the law says a Jew is anyone whose mother is Jewish or who converted to the faith. But Orthodox Jews say this is not enough. They want to amend the law so that only conversions performed by an Orthodox rabbi will count. Only 10 to 15 percent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' 5.5 million Jews are Orthodox. For the others _ although the number of converts among them may be small and the number who plan to live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> marginal _ a change in the law would cast doubt on their Jewishness. `` The American Jewish community is going to support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> regardless of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy on almost any issue,'' said <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` There is only one reservation, and that is the Who-is-a-Jew legislation.'' Jewish groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and worldwide are mobilizing their forces to fight the amendment. Representatives of organizations and private individuals have flooded <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> consulates and embassies with telegrams and phone calls opposing the change, said Rabbi <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for Progressive -LRB- Reform -RRB- Judaism. `` It's been a spontaneous reaction,'' he said. `` Who-is-a-Jew has become a symbol of what the relationship is between the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Jewish nation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on the Who's A Jew Question, an umbrella group formed last year before a previous attempt to change the law failed, voted unanimously Friday to fight the amendment, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Donshik </PERSON>, director of the Israeli office of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federations </ORGANIZATION>. He said the coalition communicated its concern to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> political parties even before last week's elections, and will repeat its message through telegrams, letters and possibly newspaper advertisements. `` The state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a mutual identification point for Jews all around the world,'' <PERSON> Donshik </PERSON> said. `` This should not be a political issue.''

<HEAD>Titan Missile Launched, Probably Carries Military Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Titan 34D rocket thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication satellites into orbit. The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the sprawling <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As usual for military space flights, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did n't announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space policy expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data system satellites are used for military communications. The satellites provide `` a way for the president to stay in touch with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and -LRB- silo-based crews operating -RRB- missiles the ` go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he said. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said two SDS satellites were `` launched five years ago. They're due for replacement.'' SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> on Titan 34Ds, he said. `` The reason I think it's SDS is I do n't think the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said. The Titan 34D, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful space booster, will be supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The last launch of a Titan 34D was from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, but sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it failed to place its payload in orbit. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other electronic communications. Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11 and a KH-9.

<HEAD>Palestinian Kills Soldier Guarding Jewish Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Palestinian day laborer today stabbed to death a soldier guarding a Jewish settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and then the assailant was killed by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> farmer, witnesses said. The soldier was killed at about 9 a.m. while guarding the gate to the <LOCATION> Massua </LOCATION> cooperative farm, 26 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Yedidia </PERSON>, head of the cooperative. The Arab worker approached the gate on foot, <PERSON> Yedidia </PERSON> said. When the guard demanded an entry permit, the assailant `` attacked the guard with a knife and stabbed him about 30 times,'' <PERSON> Yedidia </PERSON> said. One of the farm's residents `` heard shouts, he grabbed a gun, and they -LRB- the soldier and the assailant -RRB- were still entangled when he arrived. He opened fire,'' <PERSON> Yedidia </PERSON> said. The Palestinian was among about 100 seasonal laborers working in grapevines, pepperfields and flowerbeds, residents said. The cooperative was closed off by soldiers after the attack, and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, army chief of staff, came to the farm. <PERSON> Yedidia </PERSON> described relations between Arabs and Jews in the cooperative as `` generally good,'' but said members had expressed concern about Palestinians working in their midst. He said farmers or soldiers routinely guard the cooperative. Today's deaths brought the Palestinian death toll to 308 since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The guard became the 11th Israeli and second soldier to be killed. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, four Palestinians were wounded today when troops opened fire to disperse a demonstration protesting the army's closure of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools, Arab hospital officials said. Some demonstrators carried outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and others chanted `` Open our schools immediately!'' and `` Freedom for our students!'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools have been closed for most of the uprising. Army officials argue that schools are hotbets of anti-Israeli violence. A fifth Palestinian, a 14-year-old boy, was wounded in a clash with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Also today, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held talks with smaller parties for a chance to form the next coalition govermment after Tuesday's inconclusive elections. Attacks on Israelis generally boost hard-line sentiments, and an <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> firebomb attack Oct. 30 is believed to have cost Labor a crucial three seats in the 120-member Parliament. A mother and her four young sons were burned to death in the assault on a bus north of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, the largest party, seemed to have the best chance of putting together a rightist coalition with the support of four Orthodox parties. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> won 39, but the left wing parties together have 49 seats to the right's 47. Labor's chances improved Sunday after two ultra-Orthodox groups _ Shas and the <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ announced they were considering joining a Labor-led government. Another prospect of Labor participation was a joint government with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> like the one formed after 1984 elections ended in stalemate. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is under some pressure to join with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and avoid concessions that would curtail the freedom of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secular majority. The Hadashot newspaper said over the weekend that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be willing to discuss such a coalition on condition he remain prime minister, with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a Laborite, staying on as defense minister. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who has had a long-running feud with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and is a rival for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> leadership post, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television Saturday he did n't rule out a joint government with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>.

In which case look for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to put a gun issue on every ballot in every state every year forever. SOUTH DAKOTA: A <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> loyalist from Castlewood was saying recently she thought this might be a Democratic year. It would be the first one since Landslide <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> won almost everything in 1964. <LOCATION> ILLINOIS </LOCATION>: For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he needs a big turnout and a big margin from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> black voters. But some pundits believe disinterest in this key constituency may play to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advantage, here and elsewhere. -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> may have the best presidential race in the nation, but the state is so big and the ballot is so complicated that any reasonable person has lost interest. -RRB-

<HEAD>Single Winner to Receive $38 Million Lotto Jackpot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One player matched all six numbers to win a $ 38 million Lotto jackpot, but the identity of the lucky ticket-holder remains a mystery, lottery officials say. The player, who won the grand prize after a week of record-breaking ticket sales, will receive the state's second largest jackpot in annual payments over the next 20 years, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lottery. In the hour before the 7 p.m. drawing Saturday, the state's 4,100 machines processed a record 26,000 tickets per minute and sales topped $ 1.1 million an hour, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>. Ticket sales totaled $ 26.7 million for the week, including $ 11.5 million on Saturday alone, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said Sunday. Lottery officials were expected to announce the total prize _ at least $ 38 million _ today, Ms. <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> said. But she said it was unlikely the winnings would top the $ 40 million prize won in 1984 by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> printer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON>. The prize grew as no one matched all the Lotto numbers for three consecutive weeks. To win, players must match the six numbers between one and 54. Lesser prizes go to players who match four and five of the six winning numbers. The winning numbers were 33, 35, 43, 44, 45, and 52.

<TEXT>
 All but one of the forest fires that plagued <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> National Park this summer have been declared under control, thanks to early snowfall. Fire managers will watch the smoldering leftovers of the fires until the last puff of smoke dies away, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>. Only the Clover-Mist blaze, whic burned in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, has yet to be declared controlled, <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Wintry weather late last week helped get the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> and Snake complex of fires under control, she added. The snow also forced park officials Sunday to close <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south and east entrances, probably until spring The west and north entrances remain open. Officials have estimated that about 20 percent of the 1.1 million acres the fires surrounded were charred in the 2.2 million-acre park. Snow depths in the park Sunday ranged from an inch or less to as much as a foot. Active firefighting ended some weeks ago, but officials have continued to keep a close eye on the fires. As of Saturday there were still 41 people and one helicopter monitoring and doing rehabilitation work on the North Fork fire in the area of the Old Faithful geyser, while 173 people and three helicopters monitor the adjacent <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire, according to <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>. Four people were monitoring the Snake complex in the park's southern section. `` That's primarily rehabilitation crews, and some of that work is ongoing as long as weather permits,'' she said.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a frenzied campaign swing aimed at bolstering his lead over <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declared today he was winding up his marathon race for the presidency `` not in a power walk but in a sprint.'' The vice president began last-day sweep through four states by urging his rally audience in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION> to vote in Tuesday's election. And when they go to the polls, he said, they should ask themselves, `` Is the country headed in the right direction?'' Added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` The answer is, yes it is.'' The GOP nominee took what appeared to be a veiled swipe at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' penchant for getting exercise by speed walking with weights in each hand. `` In a sense, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is where we got our real start this year,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And in a sense, it's a very important place to be as we run right down to the finish line, not in a power walk but in a sprint.'' The close contest in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> `` could be the key to this whole election,'' he said, referring to the importance of the big, vote-heavy industrial states of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was the first battleground in the race for the Republican nomination, and it was there that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got his start by beating <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to counter criticism that he had set the negative tone of the 1988 presidential campaign. `` I am getting sick and tired of my opponent's complaining about the rough and tumble of this campaign, something he does every time just before an election,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally Sunday in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He seems to forget the past. He seems to forget those personal attacks night after night on me, on my character, at that idiotic Democratic convention.'' The vice president said voters can see through the `` smoke screen,'' and that `` all that's left is this daily whining about a negative campaign.'' `` My advice to the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ... is ` look my friend, if you ca n't stand the heat, get the hell out of the kitchen,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later told an outdoor rally in <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. After a day of courting voters in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to put <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> firmly into his pocket and then headed for <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two other states where the race is close, before spending tonight and Election Day in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Tonight, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making his final appeal to voters nationwide in a paid half-hour broadcast on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> networks. Campaign officials said Sunday that their tracking polls showed slippage in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support last week had subsided. But other polls for news organizations over the weekend showed some volatility, with Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gaining a little ground. National polls released Sunday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by margins ranging from five to 12 points. Surveys of the 50 states indicated, however, with indications that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has more than enough states firmly in his column to garner the 270 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes needed for victory. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces believe a Republican victory in either <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would foreclose any chance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might have of putting together a combination that adds up to 270 electoral votes. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent Sunday seeking the nation's biggest electoral prize of 47 votes, was considered a tossup in the final weekend before Election Day in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign's own polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said. `` We feel good with our electoral strength we have in both our strong states and those that are leaning to us,'' campaign Chief of Staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said of the Republican nominee's own polling figures. Sunday's theme from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his surrogates was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' complaints about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign attacks <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticism `` hypocritical'' because, he claimed, the Democrats started the campaign attacks when they derided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention this summer. He called the convention a ` three-day mudslinging festival. ` Those comments, and similar themes voiced by other campaign spokesmen came on a day when <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published a poll showing most respondents blamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> principally for the negative tone of race While blasting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for attacking his attacks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept up the offensive. `` He is naive. He is totally inexperienced in foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of his opponent. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said one of the campaign's biggest concerns was getting out the vote, a theme <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has raised continually in the past week in urging <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters against complacency. `` I never felt better, or stronger or more ready to fight for every vote out there,'' the vice president said at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> rally. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides, meantime, looked beyond Election Day to what an electoral landslide could mean to the Republican as president. `` Anything we can do to enhance <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s electoral strength by harnessing our resources ... should increase <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s electoral lead and strengthen his hand as president,'' said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>

 Students at <ORGANIZATION> Spelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a black women's school, should take the fruits of their education back to their communities and help the poor, the school's new president said at her inauguration `` If we do nothing to improve our world, then we can not call ourselves educated women,'' <PERSON> Johnetta </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Sunday. `` How can we call ourselves either educated or leaders if we turn away from the very reality that a third of black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lives in poverty? `` We must build sturdy black bridges into the very communities from which we have come.

Ms. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, first black woman president of the 107-year-old liberal arts college, was inaugurated Sunday although she has been at the school since July 1987.

One of <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s daughters attended <ORGANIZATION> Spelman </ORGANIZATION>, and episodes of his hit TV series, `` The Cosby Show,'' have been filmed there.

 About 600 people were killed or injured by an earthquake that shook a remote mountain jungle region of southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> said today. The station said it did not have a breakdown on how many of the 600 were dead and how many injured in Sunday's quake. The radio report could not immediately be confirmed independently. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which earlier reported 18 dead and 54 injured, said it had no new information. The highest previous count was from the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which reported at least 37 deaths and said more than 100 people were injured. Telephone service was cut off to the affected region, in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province near the Burmese border. The quake measured 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, and was followed overnight and early today by 34 aftershocks, the strongest measuring 7.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Roads to the affected area were impassable and <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> authorities ordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies. Yunnan Gov. He Zhiqiang flew to the scene to direct rescue work. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said most houses were destroyed in <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Menglian </LOCATION> counties, which were at the epicenter of the quake. The population of the counties was not immediately available, but officials said the area is sparsely inhabited. Buildings also were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. Most homes in that part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are simple mud and wood structures. Crews were working to repair roads, and radio contact was established, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> is home to the Lahu minority group, and the Va minority group also lives in the region. There are about 300,000 Lahu people, most of them in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province. They are related to Tibetans and Burmans and practice Buddhism. The Va people number about 260,000, speak a language of the Mon-Khmer branch and are Buddhists. Both groups are primarily farmers. At about the same time as the first quake in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a less powerful temblor was reported in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> near the Burmese border. The quake caused minor damage to buildings and made high-rise buildings sway in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, hundreds of miles to the south. In the `` Skylounge'' restaurant on the top floor of the 43-story Baiyoke Tower, <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s tallest building, hundreds of panicked patrons fled without paying their bills. The quake in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was also felt in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>, 240 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION>, a city of 1.5 million residents. The seismology bureau said there was no damage there. A quake measuring 5.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit the <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> region Oct. 15, but there were no reports of casualties. The <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> quake was the second in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the weekend. On Saturday, a quake measuring 7.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook northern <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province in far western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> seismology officials said the epicenter was in an uninhabited area of the <LOCATION> Tanggula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and there were no reports of casualties. Earthquakes occur frequently both in the <LOCATION> Tanggula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and the series of mountain chains that stretch along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern border. However, quakes measuring 7 or more on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale are rare. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake measuring 7 is capable of causing heavy damage in a populated area, while one measuring 8 is 10 times as strong and capable of tremendous damage. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, and seismology officials predicted in 1985 that quake activity would increase through the end of the century. The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985, when a temblor measuring 7.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed 71 people and injured 125 in the far western <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> Uygur Autonomous Region. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake in modern times was the temblor measuring 7.8 that leveled the northeastern industrial city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> on July 28, 1976, killing at 242,000 people by official count. The world's most deadly earthquake ever was a Jan. 24, 1556 temblor in north-central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that killed 830,000 people.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of civil servants in government offices, ports and prisons went on strike today to protest the firing of union workers at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s intelligence-gathering headquarters. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella body for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s eight civil service unions, estimated 200,000 workers took part in the one-day walkout. Dozens of lunchtime rallies were held to protest the recent firings of five men at the Government Communications Headquarters in <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>. The huge southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> facility eavesdrops on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the government maintains its work is too sensitive to risk disruption by strikes. The firings provoked new charges that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government is undermining civil liberties. The union coalition reported `` 80 percent-plus walkouts'' had shut down many employment and welfare offices, state-run job and driving-test centers across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices, prisons, airports, and magistrates courts, it said. `` We're thinking 200,000 is not a bad estimate,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenefeck </PERSON>. The five men have been fired for defying a 1984 ban on unions at the facility, and another 12 men are facing retirement, compulsory transfer or dismissal. They are the holdouts from among one-third of the 7,000 employees at the facility who were union members in 1984. At the time, most accepted about $ 1,400 in compensation to quit their union. Critics see the firings as the latest occasion on which the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government has chosen to sacrifice an element of individual freedom for what it calls the national interest. `` The present dispute is one aspect of a much larger debate,'' says <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, a professor of international history at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's become a party policy issue over the issue of openness of information, the reform of secrecy -LRB- laws -RRB-.'' The firings follow two highly controversial clampdowns. In October, the government banned broadcast interviews with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and 10 other militant <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> groups and announced plans to remove any suspects' right to remain silent under police questioning. At <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>, the unions have lost a string of legal battles and have no chance of overturning the ban, but refuse to back down. None of the holdouts had been fired until this year, although union officials say the government tried to freeze them out with tactics such as refusing them pay raises. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Grindley </PERSON>, a Chinese-language expert, estimates he lost 5,000 to 6,000 pounds -LRB- $ 8,850 to $ 10,000 -RRB- in raises before being fired in October. He now works full time on the campaign. `` We do n't think about the money too much,'' <PERSON> Grindley </PERSON>, 51, said in a telephone interview. `` It has n't been easy, but there's been compensation. ... You can hold your head up high.'' In imposing the ban, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> cited pay strikes in 1979-81 that disrupted work at <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>, the European center of Soviet eavesdropping for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The headquarters intercepts radio signals and other communications from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its East bloc allies. The facility attracted international attention in 1982 when <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prime </PERSON>, a translator in Russian at the facility, was uncovered as a Soviet agent. Prime, described as one of the West's most damaging post-World War II traitors, was sentenced to 35 years in prison `` You can make quite a strong case on the government point,'' said Professor <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, who also is a member of the editorial board of the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> and National Security. `` The government believed they had a case, it was n't just union-bashing,'' he added in an interview. `` They operate on a worst-case analysis, and -LRB- strikes -RRB- were something they had very good reason to think would happen.'' The unions reply that strikes never affected security and that the government rejected a 1984 offer of a no-strike deal. Some <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> supporters have expressed unease at the government's refusal to compromise in the <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION> dispute. Commentator <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Comfort </PERSON>, writing in the <ORGANIZATION> pro-Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> newspaper on the growing power of the state over the individual, said the government `` could have reached a no-strike agreement if it had tried.'' `` It is not just the threat of terrorism which has brought fresh intervention into our daily lives,'' Comfort added.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is mounting a last-minute television attack on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a fierce five-minute ad criticizing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on his handling of everything from crime to the environment. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad, coming amid a flurry of upbeat musical commercials and tonight's relatively tame 30-minute network appeals, summarizes the attacks Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been making against his Democratic opponent in ads and on the stump throughout the election season. `` It's running in selected markets. It's a broad overview of everything that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands for, according to his record,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad director <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> denied the ad was introduced in response to narrowing poll margins; he said it had been `` planned long ago'' and was `` in the works for weeks, literally.'' The five-minute ad features <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents and officials complaining about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' handling of pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the state's prisoner furlough program and the state's economy, including taxes, jobs and budget shortfalls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not appear. In addition to eleventh-hour attack ads, TV viewers also are being treated to sentimental media closings featuring flags, children and old people. The double-barrelled, multi-million dollar windup concludes a campaign season shaped to an unprecedented degree by television _ from 10-second sound bites and 30-second ads to extended interviews. The finale comes tonight, when each candidate airs 30-minute appeals on the three networks at a cost of $ 1 million for each campaign. Even the ads acknowledge TV's pervasive presence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s musical spot features several scenes of people watching him on their TV sets. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is shown in one of his spots watching a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attack ad and switching off the set in disgust. The fall campaigns began with made-for-TV conventions awash in flags, balloons, children and TelePrompTers, the halls carefully refashioned with seating, podiums and colors suitable for the small screen. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> program at 8 p.m. EST showcases the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains footage of his family and his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. During the program, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> urges Americans to `` look in the mirror and ask yourself _ Is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side? I want to give every American a chance to build a better life.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effort at 8:30 p.m. EST summarizes the vice president's resume, beliefs and plans for the nation The two candidates set records this year for money spent on commercials -LRB- expected to top $ 30 million apiece -RRB- and for free air time on news, talk and interview shows -LRB- at all hours of day and night -RRB-. Some say the campaigns also set a record for negative advertising. But while a mixture of ads remained on the air to the end, the mood of some of the newer spots was uplifting. <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, part of the team that brought viewers the `` Morning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' ads of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, evoke the same mood for the vice president with the same song _ `` God Bless the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' a patriotic country ballad sung by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>. There are the TV-watching scenes, a grandmother and grandchild, several Pledges of Allegiance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with world leaders and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with children dressed up as pilgrims for a play. Sings <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>: `` If tomorrow all the things were gone I worked for all my life ... I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today cause the flag still stands for freedom and they ca n't take that away. The lyrics in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' `` Anthem'' commercial reflect the Democrat's more complicated task of promising a better future without badmouthing the present. `` The time is soon,'' the singers say as a young mother caresses a baby's face. `` A bright future is what we're going to see. We keep reaching out for better and we will never say never because we know where we come from. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... is yet to come.'' The most memorable commercials of the campaign were less upbeat. `` Revolving Door,'' a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spot, showed a procession of inmates filing in and out of a revolving iron gate, then an ominous aerial view of prison grounds and a guard tower. The narrator says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed the death penalty and `` gave weekend furloughs to first-degree murderers not eligible for parole. While out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and many are still at large.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> struck back, belatedly, first with a `` Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' series that struck a raw nerve among consultants and columnists. Too confusing, too elitist, they said of the spots, which showed actors playing cynical <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handlers trying to disguise their candidate's alleged shortcomings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tank ride and derided his defense positions; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> castigated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s performance as head of anti-terrorism and drug task forces. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` on your side,'' his campaign ads pledged. `` America ca n't afford that risk,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads retorted. Did any of it matter? Yes, according to early indications. In a 1984 post-election poll of registered voters, 12 percent said commercials had helped them decide how to vote. Asked the same question in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll late last month, 25 percent of probable voters admitted their decision was influenced by commercials.

 Two officers have been suspended after the killing of an unarmed prisoner who was shot when he freed himself from handcuffs and tried to escape, authorities said. The officers fired at least 12 shots, said <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was struck by at least three bullets, two in the chest, the county medical examiner's office said Sunday Some witnesses told reporters that the officers continued shooting after <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> fell, but Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Sunday that they refused to talk to investigators and that other witnesses had disputed their reports. `` They did n't have to keep shooting that man,'' said witness <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. She told reporters that after the man was shot in the leg and in the torso, he said: `` ` Hey man, I'm not going anywhere.''' <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, wanted on a felony escape and several other warrants, was booked by police Saturday in suburban <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> for unauthorized use of a vehicle and then turned over to sheriff's Detectives <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, whose record included four <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> escape charges and one <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> escape, was handcuffed and immobilized by a leg brace during the drive to the county jail, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> managed to remove the leg brace and free his right hand from the cuffs, and when the two detectives stopped the car in the <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail garage, he left their car and started running, authorities said. The detectives shouted for him to stop, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. Brothers, initially identified as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, an alias, ran toward the jail's garage door, which was closing. `` Both -LRB- detectives -RRB- knew they could not reach Reed -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- before the door closed _ he would have been outside; they were inside,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. The officers then fired about 12 shots, and <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> fell outside the door. `` The number of times he was shot is immaterial,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The investigation is whether he was escaping. I do n't see there appears to be much doubt to that.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said state law allows use of deadly force to prevent an escape. A handcuff key was found in <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' underwear at the medical examiner's office, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, 34, were relieved of duty with pay pending an investigation by the sheriff's homicide and internal affairs divisions and the district attorney's office.

<HEAD>Elderly Couple Sues Son Over Ownership Of Their Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The case of an elderly couple suing their son in an effort to regain ownership of their own home is not as unusual as it might sound, say advocates for the elderly. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a retired fruit seller, and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, were persuaded two years ago by their 52-year-old son, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, to put their house in his name to save money on inheritance taxes. According to the elder Freemans, who are in their late 70s, the agreement was that their son would be responsible for upkeep of the house while his parents lived there on a 25-year lease. Under the arrangement, if the parents wanted to they could cancel it and take the house back in their name, they said. But the Freemans say their son did n't keep his word. So this summer they filed suit, accusing him of defrauding them of their home. They want the property back and without the $ 100,000 mortgage they say their son took out on the house to get a line of credit, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported. Said Mrs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>: `` We have n't slept nights. ... It's pretty tough when your son does that to you _ and after you've been so good to him.'' The son, a musician and court officer in <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, has declined comment. And his lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON>, said, `` I want to try my cases in court and not in the arena of public opinion. `` If you were in litigation with your father, would you want it in the newspaper?'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. Such cases are not unusual, say advocates for senior citizens. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, managing attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elderly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said her office handles five or six cases per year of people who say they were induced to give their homes to younger family members. `` It's done much too often without seniors getting proper legal advice,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. `` They trust their children.'' The elder <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he agreed to the arrangement but made it clear to his son that the house was only to be in the son's name. The two sides are scheduled to meet in court in January.

<HEAD>Court to Review Dispute Over Sculpture Depicting Plight of Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide a recurring copyright question by reviewing a dispute over a sculpture depicting the plight of the homeless. The court said it will hear an appeal by the Community for Creative Non-Violence -LRB- CCNV -RRB- and its founder, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who seek exclusive copyright ownership of the work. CCNV, which is based in the nation's capital, decided in 1985 to participate in the annual Christmas Pageant of Peace here by sponsoring a display dramatizing the plight of the homeless. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> members commissioned <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, sculptor, to create a work entitled `` Third World America.'' Using a synthetic substance called Design Cast 62 that would be tinted to resemble bronze, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> agreed to sculpt two adult figures and a child huddled on a streetside steam grate. The life-sized figures were intended to be part of an updated Nativity scene. <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> provided a steam grate and pedestal for the work. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was paid $ 15,000 for expenses and for his assistants. He donated his own services without charge. <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> sent the entire sculpture back to <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> in January 1986 for some repairs. The group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several cities to raise money for the homeless. But <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> objected to the tour because, he said, the sculpture was too fragile. He urged CCNV to cast the work in bronze or make a master mold that would withstand the tour. <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> declined, but said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> could do so if he wished. Two months later, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> refused to return the sculpture and registered it in his own name. He also said he planned to take the work on a less ambitious exhibition tour. <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> then filed a lawsuit claiming exclusive copyright ownership of the sculpture. A federal judge ruled in favor of the organization on grounds the sculpture was `` a work made for hire'' whose copyright is owned by <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION>. But the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned the judge's decision and ordered further hearings in the case The appeals court said the physical work itself is owned by <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION>. But it said the organization may have to share with <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> the copyright and any profits derived from the work and credit for its creation. `` Intense as <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION>'s participation in the project may have been, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, as sculptor, contributed more than a minimal amount of creativity to ` Third World America','' the appeals court said. `` That is enough ... to render -LRB- Reid -RRB- an author of a protected work'' under a 1976 revision of federal copyright law, the appeals court said. The only question left to be decided is whether <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> should share the copyright ownership, the appeals court said as it sent the case back to a federal judge. The Copyright Justice Coalition, representing more than 100,000 artists, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to adopt the appeals court's interpretation of the 1976 copyright law `` It is critically important for free-lance creators to be able to claim authorship of their own works in order to build a reputation that attracts new clients,'' the coalition said. `` Equally as important, free-lance creators rely heavily on the income-producing potential associated with ownership of the copyrights in their works.'' Denying artists such protection `` will dry up our national resources of free-lance creative talent,'' the coalition added. The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 88-293.

 A late-night fire spread smoke throughout a house with tightly locked doors and no smoke alarm, killing four youngsters and their grandmother, officials said. `` The call came in from a neighbor who said there was some smoke coming out from the house next door and they tried to raise some people, but got no response,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher who would n't give his name. Fire Investigator <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said the house was secured with `` double-key'' deadbolts, a type of lock which requires separate keys to lock the house from the inside and outside. `` It is not the type we like people to have,'' said <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>, adding that fire officials had not determined if the locks prevented escape. The fire broke out shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday in the one-story home not equipped with smoke alarms, officials said. Fire officials said it was extinguished quickly.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Firm Challenging Asbestos Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a company challenging federal guidelines for controlling and removing asbestos in school buildings. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the regulations are reasonable. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gypsum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading former producer of asbestos, said guidelines adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> are too vague, give school officials too much discretion and lack scientific standards. The company said the agency failed to carry out the mission assigned to it by a 1986 federal law that called for steps to protect the public against possible cancer-causing exposure to asbestos. `` Rather than doing what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had commanded, -LRB- EPA -RRB- simply repeated the vague generalities which had been the substance of its previous guidance and left it to local school authorities -LRB- and -RRB- self-interested asbestos abatement consultants to select a response action which would presumably protect human health and the environment,'' the company said. The company could be hit with lawsuits seeking reimbursement by school districts for costly asbestos cleanup measures. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled last May that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines `` represent a reasonable interpretation'' of a law that is `` somewhat contradictory.'' For example, the appeals court said the agency properly decided that school officials could require removal of asbestos from buildings. The appeals court also rejected the company's demand that the agency determine what levels of asbestos exposure are safe. There is no agreement among scientists about how much exposure is hazardous, the appeals court said. Asbestos historically was used widely in construction _ as a flame retardant, for acoustical reasons, as insulation for pipes and boilers and in ceiling and floor tiles. National Gypsum said that more than 100,000 school buildings are affected by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. `` The cost of compliance is estimated to be in excess of $ 3 billion,'' the company said, and it could go far higher if the guidelines are extended to cover other buildings. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reject the company's appeal, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gypsum </ORGANIZATION> distorted the significance of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. Most of the cost associated with asbestos cleanup is for inspections and plans that schools must develop, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. And, department lawyers said, National Gypsum is not challenging requirements that schools conduct inspections and develop plans for dealing with asbestos. The case is National Gypsum vs. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, 88-241.

 Christmas cards found in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> home of the late <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and Duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> indicate the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> sought to heal the rift caused by the abdication of King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raced from state to state the day before the presidential voting, declaring the race was getting tighter and promising a comeback victory in `` a November surprise.'' Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, pinning his hopes of overtaking <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on more than two days of non-stop stumping, spoke at sunrise to a boisterous crowd of several hundred supporters at a union hall in a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, then flew to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He was greeted at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> airport by a band playing, `` Rock Around the Clock,'' a fitting choice for his no-rest final effort. `` They talk a lot about October surprises in an election campaign,'' he told supporters. `` Tomorrow we're going to have a November surprise.'' `` The race is very, very tight. It's getting tighter by the hour,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He flew to <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on a `` red-eye'' flight from <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, before heading to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and was flying west again for a full day of campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In all, the trip to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, added to the schedule Sunday, had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveling more than 4,000 miles in eight hours. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who caught a two-hour nap on the flight east, had more stops planned on another cross-country flight early Tuesday, including a pre-dawn rally in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on the last leg of a journey that would ultimately bring him home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to vote. `` I do n't need sleep; I'm charging,'' he said. At the rally this morning, held in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union hall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued his attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican Vice Presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and promised to be a president who stands up for American workers. `` I'm not running for president to help the sharp operators on Wall Street,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I'm running to help the lathe operators and the machine operators.'' Despite little sleep, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in high spirits. `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' he declared at the opening of his speech. `` We took the red-eye to be with the Buckeyes.'' Then, acknowledging that he trails <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, `` Is <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> going to let the pollsters and the pundits decide this election or are you going to send a message to them?'' Later in the speech, he said `` We're going to win in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and all across this country.'' As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stumped Sunday his focus was on his populist appeal and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee. He scoffed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for borrowing the Democrat's `` I'm on your side'' line and said the vice president was so worried that his lead was eroding that he now was following <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> around the country. `` I'll tell you one place he's not following <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told crowds in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. `` He's not following us to 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also pressed his contention that a man who would pick <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be a heartbeat away from the presidency lacks the judgment to be president, honing the attack on a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comment that he would consider putting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s crisis management team. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> managing the Cuban missile crisis, think about it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 20,000 people at an outdoor rally at <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't afford to take that risk. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is n't a crisis manager _ he's a crisis that has to be managed.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only new idea during the campaign has been a tax cut for the rich while the Democrat listed his proposals on college financing, health care, a ban on offshore oil drilling in certain areas and his support for the Equal Rights Amendment and comparable pay for women. `` He's slipping and sliding; we're rocking and rolling,'' an upbeat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his rallies. `` Americans all over the country are looking hard at this campaign and asking themselves the fundamental question: Which candidate will stand up for working families in this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took questions from students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, Sunday night and was asked whether he thought liberal had become a dirty word. `` No, I think Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to make it a dirty word, and I object to that,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, according to most national polls, has cut into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead but still faces a formidable task if he is to break the Republican's apparent lock on the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> National polls released Sunday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by margins ranging from five to 12 points, but 50-state surveys indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has more than enough states firmly in his column to garner the 270 electoral votes needed to elect. According to aides, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is counting on winning <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, all major states in which polls show a tight race. His chances appear to hinge on beating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in at least one of three other big states where he trails <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides insist there are other scenarios that could produce a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign vice chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who has been directing the campaign from the road as he travels with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, told reporters Sunday that polling in the past 24 hours showed movement toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among undecided voters and soft <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent schedule changes to visit states shortly after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was worried that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was closing the gap. `` I want to see if he's going to follow us now _ in the next 48 hours,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said after informing reporters of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plans to campaign virtually without sleep from Sunday through Tuesday afternoon.

 An anonymous phone call led entertainer <PERSON> Redd </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON> to most of the jewelry stolen from his home in a $ 3 million burglary, including a half-pound gold watch given to him by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON> said he received the call Sunday afternoon at his home. `` Someone called and said if you want your stuff go to the fence and get it before someone else does,'' <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON> said. `` My neighbor, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, went outside and a garbage bag was hanging from the fence.'' According to a police report, the burglary occurred sometime between Thursday, when <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON>, who starred as junk dealer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> on the television series `` Sanford and Son,'' left the city, and Saturday, when he returned. Jewelry, furs and $ 107,000 in cash was taken. `` It has four lion heads on it with diamonds around the necks and was designed by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> and engraved on the inside of it,'' he said of the watch. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON>'s manager, said the burglars used an electric saw to get into the side entrance of the house. `` They knew what they were doing because they cut through two entrances so that they could enter and exit without the alarm going off,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` Once they were inside, they got through a sealed alarm closet and then they found a camouflaged safe and took the money out without a forced entry. They bypassed all of the alarms in the house.''

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Bar Against Cameras, Microphones from Presser
Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that barred television and still cameras and radio broadcasting equipment from a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> embezzlement trial. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by media representatives in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> who said banning broadcast and photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates the Constitution's free-press guarantees. The late union president <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and two local Teamsters officials in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> were indicted in 1986 on charges they violated a federal anti-racketeering law by embezzling union funds. The three were accused of keeping so-called `` ` ghost employees'' on the payroll of Teamsters Local 507. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who died in July of cardiac arrest before the trial began, was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant who said he participated in the payroll-padding scheme with the bureau's approval. The trial of the two others, Local 507 President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and secretary <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, began Oct. 12. In 1987, TV news reporter <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, radio news broadcaster <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and photographer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> asked to be allowed to bring cameras and other equipment into the courtroom to cover the upcoming trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> rejected their request. Banning cameras and the other broadcast equipment `` serves the significant government interest of promoting fair and accurate fact-finding by assuring that litigants and witnesses are not distracted by media shyness or showboating,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld White's ruling in July. The appeals court noted that a 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling said the Constitution permits the broadcasting, televising or photographing of criminal trials. But, the appeals court said, that `` is a far cry from holding that the Constitution does require that these activities be permitted during judicial proceedings.'' The media representatives said banning such coverage of trials `` promotes nothing more than federal judicial insularity.'' They said, `` Limiting access to a trial to the print media alone and to those few members of the public fortunate enough to squeeze into the courtroom in a case of great public interest denies first-hand, real-time access to tens of millions of citizens.'' They also said that modern technology permits TV cameras and radio equipment to be used unobtrusively. Most states permit some electronic media coverage of judicial proceedings. But the federal courts, including the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ban such coverage. The case is <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-601.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a free-press challenge to a judge's order that barred participants in the criminal trial of ex-Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, from talking to news reporters The court, over three dissenting votes, turned away arguments that the `` gag order'' a federal judge imposed during the since-completed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> corruption trial was an unlawful prior restraint. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case. But the votes of at least four justices are needed to grant such review. White, in an opinion joined by <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, said the high court should resolve a conflict among federal appeals courts over the issue of gag orders. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who has given up the congressional seat he held for 20 years, was convicted of extortion, tax evasion, bribery and conspiracy last August. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> extorted money from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a defense contractor in his south <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> congressional district, in exchange for his political clout. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> stood trial with six others criminally charged in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. Before the much-publicized trial began, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannella </PERSON> ordered the defendants, their lawyers and the federal prosecutors to refrain from making public statements about the case other than to repeat what already was a matter of public record. Various news organizations objected to the order, contending that it imposed a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on the press and on the free-speech rights of the trial participants. Past Supreme Court decisions have said prior restraints on speech rarely are justified, and may be used only as a last resort to ensure fair trials. But the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in upholding the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial gag order last March 14, ruled that it was not really a prior restraint. `` There is a fundamental difference between a gag order challenged by the individual gagged and the one challenged by a third party; an order objected to by the former is properly characterized as a prior restraint, one opposed solely by the latter is not,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court suggested that it would be a prior restraint on the press only if the news media already had the information and were barred from publishing it. The appeals court noted that <PERSON> Cannella </PERSON> was troubled by what seemed to be leaked information about the Wedtech-connected prosecutions. `` The problem begins not with the publishing of news by a free press, but with a hemorrhage of small leaks of secret grand jury information,'' the 2nd Circuit court said. `` This leads directly to prosecutor and defense counsel inciting trial by the press.'' In the appeal acted on today, five news organizations argued that the appeals court wrongly subjected the gag order to a less rigorous standard of review simply because it was challenged by potential recipients of speech rather than potential speakers. The appeal urged the justices to outlaw such judicial orders `` without a finding that there is a serious and imminent threat to a defendant's right to an impartial jury.'' The five news organizations that filed the appeal are <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, The Associated Press and Newsday. The case is <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 88-229.

 Authorities today questioned about 100 people suspected of sympathizing with or taking part in last week's failed coup in this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> archipelago The handcuffed prisoners were questioned at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in the capital of Male, Maj. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> said. He said most of them spoke Tamil, the language used by Sri Lankan mercenaries who raided Male on Thursday and tried to overthrow President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>'s government. Maldivian officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in fighting Thursday. Some of the attackers took 27 hostages and fled on a ship Friday, but the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> navy forced their surrender at sea Sunday. Indian commandos rescued 20 of the hostages, but four were killed. Indian officials reported the three others missing. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> said officials detained 100 people `` because they had no valid identification papers or travel documents on them, we suspect some of them were involved in the attack or sympathized with it.'' Also today, <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> officials said prepartions were under way to install <PERSON> Gayoon </PERSON> for his third term as president Friday. <PERSON> Gayoon </PERSON>, 50, was elected president in 1978 after his predecessor <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> resigned and fled to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The 62-year-old <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> has been accused of misappropriating $ 4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule. There were allegations that the failed coup was backed by <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> has denied involvement. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> has vowed to try the mercenaries. Asked what punishment the mercenaries could receive if convicted, <PERSON> Gayoon </PERSON> said: `` I ca n't tell you at this point, but we do have capital punishment. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> requested Indian assistance to quell the coup in his 2,000-island nation. The mercenaries gave up Sunday after the Indian frigate Godavari fired on their vessel 60 miles from the Sri Lankan coast, Indian officials said. <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, a Maldivian accused of masterminding the coup attempt, was among 46 people who surrendered to the Indian commandos aboard the cargo ship Progress Light, officials said. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> was once an aide to <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, whose followers also tried to overthrow <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> in 1980 and 1983. The foreign minister, <PERSON> Fathulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> hired the mercenaries and came ashore with them Thursday. Maldivian and Indian officials say most of the 150-member mercenary force escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have been searching the area.

 A small earthquake jolted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> early today, but there were no reports of damage or injuries, officials said. A quake measuring 2.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion occurred at 5:27 a.m., said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>.

The lieutenant said he sent his staff to check for damage in the area, but received no reports of any problems. Quakes up to a magnitude of 3 usually produce little damage. Temblors of 3.5 to 4 are usually considered mild, and those with magnitudes of 4 to 5 are classified as moderate. A quake with a magnitude greater than 6 could inflict widespread damage, with severe damage near the epicenter.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, sharing the platform with a caged quail, made a last-ditch appeal to salvage his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the Democratic ticket today despite polls showing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> badly. `` It's in your hands to win it. You can do it,'' the Democratic vice presidential nominee told 250 supporters at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> rally. `` Go flat out ... win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Standing near a live quail in a cage at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' Union Station, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator taunted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` How do you like the idea of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> standing in the wings,'' he asked, turning his thumb down and drawing hoots from the crowd. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was ending his campaign with a one-two punch at every stop on election eve. He accused the Republicans of dirty campaigning and assured his listeners that Democrats are friends of working people. `` We're on your side and they are not,'' he said. Noting that nearly 200 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks have failed in the past few years, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused the vice president of doing nothing for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims as a residence, while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was helping bankers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We want a Texan in there who's interested in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` We're going to help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> insists that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its 29 electoral votes are winnable for the Democrats, even though many polls show he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing by double digits. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate was scouring <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for votes and heading via <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for hastily arranged visits to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. His scheduled stops today included <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The schedule was originally scheduled to end after <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, but late Sunday the campaign added nighttime rallies in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. _ two states the Democrats are still hoping to swing in their direction. In addition to his public stops, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be doing interviews via satellite with television stations in several other key states. `` We're doing hand-to-hand combat in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and we're going for the airwaves'' in battleground states, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, the campaign's director of communications. The expanded schedule, he said, was `` to take advantage of a dramatic tightening of the race'' in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` The question is whether it is enough time'' to bring about an upset of the Republican ticket, he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself has launched into around-the-clock campaigning heading into Election Day, with an early morning event in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and a return visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> rally. However, the sleepless campaign swing was not being asked of the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a rally outside the city's train station that the Democrats are concerned about the middle class _ a theme <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been hammering in his campaign stops `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are on the side of the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Republicans are on the other side,'' said the Democratic candidate, who addressed the crowd in both Spanish and English _ an appeal to the state's large Hispanic population. Like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has for the past few weeks made attacks on the negative tone of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign a central theme of his own. The backlash from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` distortions,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says, is a major factor in the Democrats' narrowing of the Republican lead in the polls. Surveys released Sunday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by margins ranging from five points to 12 points. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters on Sunday that the tone of the campaign has hurt both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and said that no matter who wins, neither one will have a `` serious mandate.'' `` I certainly do n't think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have a mandate because of the negative campaign that's been run,'' he said. As for his Democratic running mate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will not have as much as a mandate as he deserves because it was difficult to get the issues across with all the clutter of negative advertising,'' he said. `` But I also believe the two of us together, with me as vice president ... that we will be able to get our legislative program through better than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would.'' The lack of a mandate `` means more work and a lot more swabbing that has to be done, and I think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can do that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The official media today launched an attack on <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in response to the Solidarity leader's threat of strikes unless authorities suspend the decision to close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. An editorial in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> said, `` In the past, it was alleged that when the authorities lacked arguments, they resorted to repression. Today, when <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> lacks arguments, he loads the strike cannon.'' The editorial follows remarks by the leader of the banned union federation Sunday that he was prepared to call a nationwide `` strike alert'' to demand preservation of the 10,000-worker shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity. The commentary was unusual because the official press recently had avoided criticizing <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> by name while the government and the opposition prepared talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. But the proposed talks have stalled and now the government and opposition appear to be on a collision course over the scheduled Dec. 1 closing of the shipyard. `` In a period when concrete decisions are being made about reforms ... <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has a different plan: Strike alert and strikes. It happened before. The country does not need strike amok but reconciliation.'' A statement released Sunday by Solidarity's national executive commission threatened broad protests, including strikes, if the government does not rescind the shipyard decision. It was the strongest from Solidarity since Communist authorities announced Oct. 31 that they intend to close the shipyard. On Saturday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would not meet with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> to discuss plans for the talks unless the shipyard decision is suspended and all workers fired for taking part in strikes in August are rehired. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> said the Solidarity leader told worshipers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s church in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Sunday that he would call a national `` strike alert'' at a workers' rally scheduled Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port. `` If there is still great pressure on him from the side of the shipyard and other enterprises as well, then on Tuesday he will announce a strike alert for the whole country,'' said <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>. A `` strike alert'' would mean organizing strike committees and getting workers prepared to strike at any moment, said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON>. The Solidarity statement denounced the decision to close the yard as ` a dangerous political act'' and `` an act of revenge against Solidarity.'' It said any closures should be preceded by a period of review of economic performance, with workers and their representatives taking part. Since promising Aug. 31 to meet with the opposition to discuss legalization of Solidarity and how to revive <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s limping economy, the government has discouraged prospects by insisting that Solidarity drop two alleged extremists from its delegation to the talks. That condition, together with officials' decision to close the shipyard and the failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for roles in the August strikes, has convinced Solidarity that the government is no longer interested in talks. Solidarity, the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc, was born August 1980 during a nationwide strike wave, crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year.

 Detectives are using computers in an effort to find a common denominator connecting more than 230 <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> residents who have received highly personalized extortion letters. `` They tell them they're going to kill them. It's a ` Pay up or die, we're not messing around!' type of thing. They threaten their children or other members of their family,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>. The letters, sent to doctors, dentists, lawyers and affluent business people, demanded payments ranging from $ 500 to more than $ 500,000, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. The letters were so personal that the author is believed to have intimate knowledge of the victims and their families. `` A lot of people have anxiety because of the personalized nature of the letters,'' said <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, who is part of a small task force investigating the case. `` There was stuff in some of the letters that could almost be classified as gossip,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grooms </PERSON>, city editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Antelope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which is offering a $ 10,000 reward. `` Some goes back four or five years. In one instance, there was nickname a guy had in high school.'' Computers were being used in an effort to find a common thread of clues that might link the victims to a suspect, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, deputies were interviewing letter recipients to see if their families, jobs or other outside activities might make them targets of extortion. The letters were mailed Nov. 1 with a Mojave postmark and sent to people in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> and the unincorporated area of <LOCATION> Quartz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told fellow Californians today their votes could be crucial in assuring `` a new beginning for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by electing Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president and staving off a late-hour drive by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In a speech prepared for delivery at the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, a former luxury ocean liner converted to a waterfront hotel, the 77-year-old president said he was returning to his home state at the end of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign just as he did in his own campaigns for the White House. `` Today, of course, is the last day of this, my last campaign as president,'' he said. `` But tomorrow launches a new beginning for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` They will determine how <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> goes, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> may send the next president to the White House.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has 47 electoral votes as the most populous state. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lavished praise on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has served under him for nearly eight years as vice president. `` This year, one of the best qualified men to ever seek the office of president is on the ballot,'' he said. Of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal qualities, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` He is strong, decent, loyal, wise, capable and compassionate.'' `` As for his opponent, we only really began to learn about him during the last few months,'' the president said. `` He has been vague as to what he would do in office, yet when we focus on his record, he objects.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the Democratic nominee `` is against voluntary prayer in school ... appointed judges to his state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> who have voted to strike down a ban on child pornography ... and, in every case, even for the most brutal crimes, he opposes the death penalty.'' `` He's free to have these views, but is this the man we want choosing the justices to sit on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' he asked. The former movie actor recalled that it was from the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, then a British liner, that he first saw the Statue of Liberty on his return from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he filmed `` The Hasty Heart.'' `` This is my last campaign, and seeing all of you ... and seeing the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> again, it's like closing a circle, like sailing into harbor after a long and wonderful voyage to be greeted by old, beloved friends,'' the president said. From <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 77, headed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for a nostalgic visit to the seaside city where he held his final campaign rally on the eve of his landslide re-election in 1984. He was flying for 10 hours and 20 minutes during a roundtrip from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just to make two speeches in three hours and five minutes in his home state. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have traveled about 25,000 miles and made 30 political appearances in 16 states for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since Labor Day, including today's trip. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was making his first roundtrip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a single day at the request of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign because <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> polls say the presidential contest is `` nip and tuck'' in the state. The former <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie star, who spent two terms in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> as governor, made seven earlier political appearances in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during the current presidential campaign. He spoke in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> on Aug. 23, in Thousand Oaks and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> on Aug. 27, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Oct. 27 and in <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> last Wednesday. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> is a prime target because the county is one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s most heavily Republican, with more registered <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters than Democrats, although the Democrats hold a statewide registration edge of 50.4 percent to 38.6 percent. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> also has more registered Republicans than Democrats, as does <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in which <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> are located. The latest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll, conducted by <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> and released Thursday, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an 8-point edge among likely voters. However, an administration official traveling with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday, speaking on condition he not be identified, said more recent Republican tracking polls showed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead had narrowed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesmen said their polls showed the same thing.

<HEAD>Court To Study Case of Former Dallas Football Coach in Racial Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to study the case of a former <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> high school football coach who says he lost his job because he is white. The court said it will hear competing appeals filed by <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, longtime coach and athletic director at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. The justices will study a 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling that ordered a new trial for <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the city school district and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION>'s principal. A federal jury had awarded <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> $ 850,000 in damages, reduced by a federal trial judge to about $ 563,000. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> had coached the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> football team since 1962 when, in the spring of 1983, he was transferred to another city high school. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> had been named head coach and athletic director at the school in 1970, the year the racial composition at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION> changed from predominantly white to predominantly black. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who is black, became the school's principal in 1975. According to the 5th Circuit court, tensions between <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> were exasperated by events surrounding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION>'s loss to <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> in the state high school championship game in November 1982. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>'s appeal said, `` <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> believed that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION> would have to recruit young black athletes at the junior high school level and he evidently believed that a successful recruiter would have to be black.'' The appeal added that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> `` decided to replace <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> with a black coach.'' <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> sued the school district and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> over his transfer to a teaching position at another school. His suit, filed under a much-used civil rights law, alleged that school officials had violated his due-process, free-speech and equal-protection rights. The jury ruled that the city school district should be held legally liable for what it found to be violations of <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>'s rights but the appeals court ruled that the jury `` did not make sufficient findings to support municipal liability.'' The appeals court ordered a new trial for that reason. The issue to be studied by the justices is whether public employees who claim racial discrimination must show that the bias resulted from official `` policy or custom'' before recovering damages from their employers. The cases are <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, 87-2084, and <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, 88-214.

<HEAD>Court Rules Huntington, N.Y., Officials Reinforced Racial
Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled that <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials reinforced racial segregation by confining housing for low-income families to a predominantly non-white urban renewal area. By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld a ruling that could make it easier to use a federal civil rights law to challenge community zoning ordinances that limit low-cost housing. But the high court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, declined to answer the key question posed by the case: Does a zoning regulation violate fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 when there is evidence of discriminatory impact but not discriminatory motives? City officials conceded originally that the `` disparate impact'' theory applied to the case, the justices said. `` We are satisfied on this record that disparate impact was shown, and that the sole justification proferred to rebut -LRB- that argument -RRB- was inadequate,'' the high court said. `` We do not reach the question whether that test is the appropriate one.'' Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented. They voted to hear arguments in the case to explore the issue. A federal appeals court said statistical studies showing a zoning ordinance's discriminatory effects, even if unintentional, could establish a violation of the 1968 law. The alternative approach _ supported by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration among others _ would require the more difficult task of proving the zoning ordinance is intentionally biased. Administration lawyers supported the appeal by <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> officials. `` Congress intended to require a showing of intentional discrimination'' when it passed the fair housing law, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last April that <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s zoning ordinance perpetuated segregation by confining to a predominantly black area subsidized apartments designed to benefit poorer families. `` The disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impact on the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone create a strong ... showing of discriminatory effect,'' the appeals court said. The town failed to present `` bona fide and legitimate justifications for its action'' or show there were `` no less discriminatory alternatives available,'' the appeals court added. Another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> community _ <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> _ has been embroiled in a fight over a court order to build low - and moderate-income housing In that case, the 2nd Circuit court ruled <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> acted unlawfully by intentionally maintaining segregated housing and schools. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> community of some 200,000 residents, has a black population of less than 3.5 percent. Most blacks live in two neighborhoods. The National Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, along with a local group called <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, sued the town in 1981 for its refusal to approve multi-family dwellings on a 14.8-acre site in <LOCATION> Greenlawn </LOCATION>, a predominantly white hamlet of single-family houses. <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> proposed to build 162 federally subsidized low-income apartments there. A federal judge ruled that <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON>'s zoning ordinance did not violate the 1968 federal civil rights act. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> officials noted that the town has 775 low-income housing units and said the town has done its fair share in developing subsidized dwellings. But the 2nd Circuit court said confining such apartments to the urban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks. While the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whites than blacks in the community, it noted that only 7 percent of all <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent of black families needed such help. Placing low-income housing in predominantly white <LOCATION> Greenlawn </LOCATION> will promote integration, the 2nd Circuit court said. The appeals court said it took the extraordinary step of ordering <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> to approve the proposed 162-unit project because `` further delay might well prove fatal'' to the plan. The case is <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1961.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by North Dakota Couple on Educating Son at

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> couple charged with truancy for educating their son at home in accord with their religious principles. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reinstated the charges. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Melin </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, were accused of failing to send their son, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>, to public school as required by state law. The Melins, who have bachelor's degrees, said they are qualified to teach Teddy at home. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law requires that children attend public school or be taught by a state-certified teacher. The Melins, who do not have such certification, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the only state that has an absolute requirement that home-school teachers be certified. A state judge in 1987 threw out the truancy charges against the Melins on grounds the teacher certification requirement violated their constitutionally protected right to exercise their religion freely. But the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the charges last July. The state court said reviving the case would not violate the Melins' protection against double jeopardy _ being prosecuted twice for the same alleged offense. The judge who dismissed the case did not acquit them, the state court said. Double jeopardy `` occurs only when the trial court has resolved some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,'' the state court said. The state court also rejected the Melins' argument that requiring them to be state-certified is not the least restrictive means of enforcing the state's compelling interest in the education of children. `` We continue to believe the state has compelling interest in ensuring that when public or non-public education occurs that it is conducted by persons who are knowledgeable and who are able to impart that knowledge in a manner conducive to a child's education,'' the state court said Requiring teachers to be certified by the state furthers that goal, it added. The case is <PERSON> Melin </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 88-470.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> today paid a hospital visit to her husband, <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The government denied media speculation that he or his colleagues would be released. Several South African newspapers have been quoting government sources for the past week as saying <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be released before the end of the year from his life prison sentence. He was imprisoned in 1962. The Prisons Service and other government sources emphatically denied that either <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> or any of the other five men imprisoned with him for plotting to overthrow the government would be released today. The officials would not comment on the possibility of releases at a future date. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s visit lasted 45 minutes and was described by <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> as normal. <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, accompanied Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid activist, said there was `` no indication -LRB- <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> -RRB- would be released today or in the near future.'' One government source indicated his belief that the rumors circulating today were being orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action. The rumors have been building since August, when the 70-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was transferred from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> hospital for treatment of tuberculosis. He was later transferred to the private <ORGANIZATION> Constantiaberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, where doctors say he has recovered. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he hoped it would be possible not to send <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> back to prison. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s offers to release him in exchange for a renunciation of violence, saying the government must make a similar renunciation and lift restrictions on black political activity. In addition to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and four lesser known <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members are still in prison from the 1964 trial. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 The two German nations today recalled the `` fascist racial madness'' of Kristallnacht, the night a half-century ago that signaled the start of the systematic <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> campaign to annihilate Jews. Towns and cities in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the West have begun paying tribute to the victims of the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi sympathizers looted and burned Jewish temples and businesses, beating and killing scores of Jews and sending 30,000 of them to concentration camps. The rampage became known as Kristallnacht _ or `` Crystal Night'' _ because of the shards of broken glass that filled the streets. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Foschepoth </PERSON>, the general secretary of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>, said the night marked `` the start of a new phase, the phase of the physical annihilation of the Jews. This week, hundreds of gatherings, panel discussions and ceremonies will mark the 50th anniversary Wednesday of what the West German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> called a night of `` fascist racial madness.'' In the East German city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, officials and members of the Jewish community today paid tribute to the victims by laying wreaths at the site of the synagogue that was destroyed and at the city's Jewish cemetery <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s tiny Jewish community, said his nation _ which has emphasized how communists as well as Jews were persecuted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> _ appears to be learning more from the lessons of the past than neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` In -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, there's a greater cracking down on neo-fascist ways of thought than in -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, where meetings of former <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> can take place under police protection,'' <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> said Sunday in an interview on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The city of <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has organized an exhibit about Jewish life during the Nazi era, which includes `` shocking, original fascist documents in which an expulsion order and the stripping of -LRB- German -RRB- citizenship are communicated to Jews,'' according to the news agency. Residents of <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>, a West German town of 16,500 near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, on Sunday placed a wreath at the site where the synagogue was burned down on Nov. 10, 1938. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Bundestag, or parliament, will hold a solemn ceremony on Thursday. In the city of <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION>, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, a new synagogue will be dedicated Wednesday. The number of deaths on Kristallnacht remains uncertain. At least 195 synagogues and about 7,500 Jewish businesses were either destroyed or badly damaged. Some estimates put the number of vandalized synagogues at more than 1,100. `` Throughout -LRB- <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- that night, 91 Jews met their death under the sticks, boots and bullets of the death squads of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> movement,'' <PERSON> Foschepoth </PERSON> told 125 residents of <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` How was all this possible?'' During their rule from 1933 to 1945, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> murdered an estimated 6 million Jews. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid the equivalent of $ 44 billion, at today's currency exchange rates, in compensation to Holocaust victims and their survivors There are about 32,000 Jews living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while the number of practicing Jews in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is estimated to be between 450 and 600.

 A kidney specialist has been ordered to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the life-giving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors. But a temporary restraining order issued Friday also said <PERSON> Jeanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ojai </LOCATION> must go elsewhere for treatment after the order expires Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has accepted her for dialysis, but Ms. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> said the 80-mile trip three days a week would be impossible for her in her weakened condition. `` This is going to be a slow death. There's no way I can withstand it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>. A friend now drives her 40 miles to <LOCATION> Cottage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, 38, claims kidney specialists from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> have refused to treat her because of her 1986 lawsuit against a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> specialist that contends impure water was used in the blood-purifying dialysis procedure. The suit is pending. Her current physician, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he was dropping Ms. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> because she was too aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town. Ms. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> described herself as an assertive patient who sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with. Three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties have refused to see her, she said. <PERSON> Doner </PERSON> has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient, his lawyer said. `` It's well-established law that a physician may select which patients he cares for,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haider </PERSON>. The few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctor's right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new patient, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> But arrangements have usually been made to provide life-sustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients, he said. `` There are cases where patients have been dialyzed while shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't just be abandoned in a life-and-death situation.''

 A truck driver has been arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and charged with second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend, whose body was found in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> drainage ditch after a six-week search. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, was arrested without incident Saturday night after he arrived in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with a truckload of meat, according to a statement issued by <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The body of <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross-Patterson </PERSON>, 34, a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> secretary, was found that morning along a drainage ditch near <LOCATION> Neola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. An autopsy performed Sunday confirmed the identity, the police statement said. Ms. <PERSON> Ross-Patterson </PERSON> was reported missing after she failed to arrive at North High for work Sept. 27. Police said early in the investigation that <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> was the last person known to have seen her. Her car was found in a grocery store parking lot. According to <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' statement, the autopsy found that Ms. <PERSON> Ross-Patterson </PERSON> was killed by several blows to the head with a blunt object. Her body was found about 100 feet from where a man from the <LOCATION> Neola </LOCATION> area reported that he saw the missing woman's car Sept. 27. The Neola man told police that a man, later identified as <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, had come to his home asking for help in pulling his car from a ditch. Ms. <PERSON> Ross-Patterson </PERSON>'s body was found by the sixth weekend search by relatives and volunteers. About 120 people joined the search Saturday. Recent frost had reduced weed cover, allowing searchers to locate the body, the police statement said.

 Typhoon Skip lashed central Philippine islands today with 108 mph winds and torrential rains, causing floods and mudslides that forced thousands of people to flee their homes. Damage and casualty reports were sketchy because of poor communications to the affected area. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZGE </ORGANIZATION> in Naga reported 10 people, six of them children, were killed today in a mudslide near the city, about 210 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. There was no official confirmation of the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said about 200,000 people had been `` affected'' by <PERSON> Skip </PERSON>, the second typhoon to hit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in two weeks. Most of them were on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which was without electricity after Skip blew down power lines, the department said. The storm came ashore early today on <LOCATION> Samar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 410 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and was heading northwest at 13.6 mph, the government weather service said. Its stiff winds and high waves sank a freighter in port. Storm warnings were announced for <PERSON> Samar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other islands in the central Visayas chain, as well as <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> provinces. The weather service predicted winds up to 60 mph would lash those areas. Residents of coastal areas were advised to move to higher ground and small craft were ordered to remain in port. The storm was expected to pass about 75 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> early Tuesday. Forecasters said <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> could expect strong winds and rains but predicted less damage in the capital than during Typhoon Ruby two weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> canceled at least 35 domestic flights today as the storm approached. The coast guard suspended all passenger ship service to ports in the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Sunday, stranding thousands of passengers in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and other major ports. Heavy rains triggered by Typhoon Skip unleashed landslides on the slopes of the <LOCATION> Mayon </LOCATION> volcano, about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bicol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. It said hundreds of families were isolated by the slides, but there were no reports of fatalities. It quoted local officials as saying about 2,600 people had been evacuated from the slopes of <LOCATION> Mayon </LOCATION>, the country's most famous volcano. The coast guard said a freighter, the Sea Runner, sank in port on <LOCATION> Bohol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> early today after being buffeted by strong winds and heavy waves from Skip. All 17 crewmen escaped, the coast guard said, but the ship's cargo of 11,250 bags of cement was lost. The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said 14 of the 16 towns in <LOCATION> Capiz </LOCATION> province, 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, were flooded today and that hundreds of families were being evacuated to schools and churches. Typhoon Skip struck as this archipelago nation was still reeling from the effects of Typhoon Ruby, which hit the country Oct. 24, and tropical storm <PERSON> Tess </PERSON>, which swept through the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Saturday. Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least 64 others were killed and more than 200 others are missing from the passenger ship <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, which sank about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> during the typhoon. On Saturday, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> on the southeastern edge of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> overflowed its banks and more than 3,000 people fled their homes. Officials said the water level in the lake was about 5 -LCB- feet above normal because of heavy rains that struck in the wake of <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>. Skip was the 20th typhoon or tropical storms to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether the government may confiscate from criminal defendants money and property that could be used to pay their legal fees. The court announced it will review cases stemming from federal prosecutions of drug dealers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The justices thus set the stage for an important ruling on the rights of the accused and the government's power to fight crime by seizing illicit criminal proceeds. Their decision is expected in 1989. In one case, the law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> here was denied $ 170,000 in legal fees for representing <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty in 1985 in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a multi-million-dollar drug operation. <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON> was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. The seizure of the money left him without funds to pay <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON>. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last January that <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON> is not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the law firm. In the second case, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appealed a ruling that allows <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsanto </PERSON> access to assets worth $ 400,000 to help him pay his lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> was convicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of charges he headed a heroin-selling ring. The jury also ordered him to forfeit to the government a house in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, valued at $ 335,000, a $ 30,000 cooperative apartment in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and $ 35,000 in cash. But the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in July he could use the assets to pay legitimate legal fees incurred in his defense. At issue are forfeiture provisions of key federal crime-fighting laws, including the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations statute. The 4th Circuit court ruled in <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON>'s case that the constitutional right of the accused to be represented by a lawyer does not entitle the defendant to an attorney of his choice. `` The right to counsel of choice belongs only to those with legitimate assets,'' the appeals court said in a 7-4 decision. `` The right to counsel does not guarantee that every defendant will have the lawyer he desires.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON>, and other attorneys, argue that confiscating the assets of people when they are indicted will leave them too poor to pay their own lawyers. The 4th Circuit court, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said those defendants will still be represented by court-appointed attorneys. The appeals court used the example of a robber caught with $ 100,000 taken from a bank. `` Surely no one will contend that the $ 100,000 must be made available to pay the defendant's lawyer and not be kept available for return to the bank in the event the defendant is found guilty,'' the 4th Circuit court said. But the 2nd Circuit appeals court, in an 8-4 decision, said <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to use his assets to pay his lawyer. The 2nd Circuit ruling produced eight opinions, including three by those in the majority who ruled in <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>'s favor. One opinion favoring <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> that was signed by three judges said, `` The government must prove that an accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It must do this by obtaining convincing evidence of the defendant's guilt, not by preventing the defendant from retaining counsel of choice.'' In other action, the court: _ Agreed to decide a recurring copyright question by reviewing a dispute over a sculpture depicting the plight of the homeless commissioned by the Community for Creative Non-Violence. The court said it will hear an appeal by the group and its founder, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who seek exclusive copyright ownership of the work. _ Refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to prevent `` white flight'' from the nation's largest publicly assisted housing development. The court, with one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that the racial distribution of apartments at the middle-income <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> development in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, violates the federal Fair Housing Act. _ Rejected an appeal by a company challenging federal guidelines for controlling and removing asbestos in school buildings. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the regulations are reasonable. _ Rejected a free-press challenge to a judge's order that barred participants in the criminal trial of former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, from talking to news reporters. The court, over three dissenting votes, turned away arguments that the `` gag order'' a federal judge imposed during the since-completed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> corruption trial was an unlawful prior restraint. _ Let stand a ruling a that barred television and still cameras and radio broadcasting equipment from a trial of the late Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and two others. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by media representatives in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> who said banning broadcast and photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates the Constitution's free-press guarantees. _ Agreed to study the case of a former <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> high school football coach who says he lost his job because he is white. The court said it will hear competing appeals filed by <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, longtime coach and athletic director at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. _ Ruled that <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials reinforced racial segregation by confining housing for low-income families to a predominantly non-white urban renewal area. The forfeiture cases are <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1729, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, 88-454.

 Nearly a thousand officers from around the Northeast marched today in the funeral procession of a police cadet who collapsed during a rigorous training program. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, underwent a liver transplant a week after he fell ill on a running track at the state-run police academy in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. He lapsed into a coma for two weeks, emerged, then lost consciousness last Monday. He died Wednesday at a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital. His death and the hospitalization of several other cadets has prompted a re-examination of the state's police training programs. `` Despite his pain, despite his suffering, his wracked body hooked to machines, he smiled and he shed the light of his life on all of us,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a family friend and chaplain at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said in his homily. `` God was with him in a special way.'' Scores of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> officers led the 150-cruiser procession to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, followed by police on motorcycles and horseback, color guards from 50 departments in all six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> had been named the club's Youth of the Year in 1981. After the funeral, the procession was to head to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, a half-mile away, for burial Lines outside the 1,500-seat church began forming more than an hour before the funeral, and loudspeakers were hung outside the building. Among the mourners were state police troopers from western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the 46 cadets still training at <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. State police said they scaled back their presence at the funeral from six cruisers of troopers after <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s family initially asked that state police not attend at all. They withdrew the request Sunday, according to <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>. More than 2,000 people turned out for <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s wake Saturday and Sunday. The police department's teletype machine has received messages of condolence from all over the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and even from as far south as <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The last <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> officer to die in the line of duty was killed in 1898 while pushing a woman and her child to safety off the tracks of an oncoming train. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was one of 16 cadets hospitalized in the first week of training. The illness prompted at least three state investigations and resulted in the resignation of the head of the state's police training program. An autopsy Friday indicated <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> died from infections that set in because of his weakened condition from training and a liver transplant. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> had collapsed from heat stroke Sept. 19 at the end of the grueling first day of training. Other cadets reported that they were put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of water. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s death will be the subject of an inquest to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the state troopers in charge of training. A month-long investigation into the illnesses found a `` massive failure'' of the system that led to abusive training.

 Hospital emergency room admissions for incidents involving cocaine and other drugs have grown dramatically, according to excerpts from a federal report released today by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The report, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, compares changes from 1986 to 1987.

<BYLINE>Court Refuses to Reinstate Racial Quota System at New York Housing
Development
^By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to prevent `` white flight'' from the nation's largest publicly assisted housing development. The court, with one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that the racial distribution of apartments at the middle-income <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> development in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, violates the federal Fair Housing Act. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case. But at least four votes are required to grant such review. The owners of <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said they tried to preserve integration at the development by allocating 64 percent of the apartments to whites, 22 percent to blacks and 8 percent to Hispanics. The remaining apartments were for Orientals and other minorities. <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ with 46 high-rise buildings, 5,881 apartments and more than 17,000 people _ receives state and federal financial assistance and tax breaks from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The quota system has meant that blacks and Hispanics seeking apartments in <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have spent long periods on the waiting list. A group of black applicants filed a federal suit in 1979 challenging the quotas. The suit was settled in 1984 with the owners agreeing to provide an additional 175 apartments over five years for blacks and other minority applicants. The federal government then filed its own suit a month after the settlement, alleging the quotas violate the anti-discrimination Fair Housing Act of 1968. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said it is illegal to impose quotas that hurt minority applicants, even if the purpose is to maintain a system of racial balance that will discourage whites from fleeing. The system denies blacks and Hispanics the freedom `` to live where income permits,'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said. Arguing that the housing complex will become predominantly black and Hispanic if quotas are not maintained `` blatantly caters to white prejudice,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 2-1 ruling last March, agreed with the government. The Fair Housing Act does not permit `` rigid racial quotas of indefinite duration to maintain a fixed level of integration at <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by restricting minority access to scarce and desirable rental accommodations,'' the appeals court said. Judge <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion on the appeals court, said he was convinced abandoning the quotas would produce white flight. `` The Fair Housing Act does not require this tragedy to occur,'' he said. The owners of <LOCATION> Starrett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were supported in their appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the development's tenants association. `` The successful 15-year experiment at the nation's largest federally assisted housing development is in jeopardy,'' the association said. The case is vs. <ORGANIZATION> Starrett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-82.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked confidently of fast finishes today as they crossed paths in battleground states on the final day before Americans choose a new president. <PERSON> Underdog </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised `` a November surprise,'' while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared he was finishing `` not in a power walk but in a sprint.'' Like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was racing through key states. In addition to several stops in his home base of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was slated to campaign in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> with a caged quail at his side and drew hoots from a crowd when he asked, `` How do you like the idea of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> standing in the wings?'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee campaigned in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and in safely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> as well as <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, his home state. The latest polls bolstered the vice president's optimism as he followed his Democratic rival into <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and roared toward <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. At a sunrise rally in a steelworkers union hall outside <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in high spirits after snatching a two-hour nap on an overnight flight from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. ` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We took the red-eye to be with the Buckeyes.'' `` I do n't need sleep, I'm charging,'' he said. `` We're going to win.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his day in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and took a jab at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fondness for exercising by walking rapidly while carrying weights. The vice president said the race in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was close and `` it's a very important place to be as we run right down to the finish line, not in a power walk but in a sprint. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when Americans vote they should ask themselves this question: `` Is the country headed in the right direction? The answer is, yes it is.'' From <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was headed for rallies in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he maintains his voting residence. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> preceded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> by a couple of hours and told his audience, `` This is the ` show me' state, and I'm here to show you how much I want your support,'' he said. Then, in a reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, `` Are you going to let the pollsters and pundits decide this election, or are you going to send a message that can be heard from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>?'' `` They talk a lot about October surprises in an election campaign,'' he told supporters. `` Tomorrow we're going to have a November surprise.'' `` The race is very, very tight. It's getting tighter by the hour,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was spending the day campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Both camps bombarded voters with 30-second commercials and the two candidates were the stars of 30-minute prime time election eve programs running back-to-back on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign unleashed a final attack ad _ a five-minute television commercial that summed up all the earlier attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record. `` It's running in selected markets. It's a broad overview of everything that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands for, according to his record,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad director <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said. The ad features <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents and officials complaining about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' handling of pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the state's prisoner furlough program and the state's economy, including taxes, jobs and budget shortfalls <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not appear. A rush of late national polls said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president was leading by margins ranging from five to 12 percentage points. A 50-state, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll of 7,777 likely voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was solidly favored or leading in states with enough electoral votes to assure his election. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> state-by-state survey said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leading in states with 356 electoral votes _ 86 more than the 270 needed for a majority _ while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was ahead in states with a total of 101 electoral votes. Another 81 were in tossup states that included <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Among the new polls, Gallup put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by 12 percentage points, while <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> made it 11. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> set the margin at 10 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said the difference was nine points. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll and another by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said the margin for the vice president was five points with enough people undecided or wavering to allow for dramatic last-minute changes. The presidential candidates were n't the only ones winding up their campaigns. There were 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and the entire <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> being filled on Tuesday and 12 states were electing governors. Democratic control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appeared secure and the Democrats appeared likely to add to the 27 to 23 edge they now have among governors. Thousands of other offices were being filled and scores of initiatives also were on ballots, including 39 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on which opposing sides spent more than $ 100 million. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began a marathon race around the country late Sunday flying from <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, with a dawn arrival in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city. From <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> he was heading for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and then on to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Aides were considering another 1,000-mile detour from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> before addressing a rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Then it was on to a pre-dawn Election Day rally in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and a stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> before ending the campaign back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Whatever sleep he got would be in a tourist class seat on his campaign plane. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a celebrity-studded rally in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was putting up `` a last minute smokescreen ... So now all that's left is this daily whining about a negative campaign. ... Do n't listen to the crying on the far left.''

 The fifth slaying of a cabdriver this year in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has made cabbies wary about whom they pick up, where they go and when they work. `` I do n't cruise the streets,'' said <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, 43, a five-year veteran. `` You find out the drug places; you do n't go there.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 47, was stabbed by a passenger six times in the head and chest early Sunday and left to die behind his steering wheel in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, police said. Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiler </PERSON> heard brakes screeching and a crash, then saw that the taxi had jumped a curb and stopped under a railroad bridge, homicide Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The passenger jumped out and yelled at <PERSON> Eiler </PERSON>, `` He tried to rob me,'' before the officer lost him in the darkness, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. A bloody knife was found in the cab, police said. No arrest had been made Monday, said Detective <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuto </PERSON>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates taxis, does not require the city's 1,532 licensed cabs to have bullet-resistant shields separating the front and back seats to protect the drivers, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, a former cabdriver and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The shields are required in several cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I know a lot of people are scared. I'm scared myself,'' said <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chukwurah </PERSON>, 26, who has been robbed once since he began driving cabs in December. He said he no longer drives at night and just looks for fares at hotels, train stations and airports. He only picks up people on the street if they are office workers, couples or people with children. `` If it was just a single person just walking, I would n't pick them up, regardless if they were white or black or whatever they were,'' said <PERSON> Chukwurah </PERSON>, who is black. Even so, the man who robbed him was dressed up and carrying a briefcase, he said. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 57, who said he has driven a cab for about a year, said he refuses to take people to housing projects. `` They might take you to a project and there might be people waiting on you to rob you and maybe steal the cab, the radio, the meter,'' he said. Two people have been charged with murder in the Sept. 18 death of a cabbie who was found with a bullet wound in the back of his head. One man has been charged with murder and robbery in the July 24 death of a cabbie whose body was found riddled with bullets. No one has been arrested in the deaths of a cabbie shot in the head on June 26, or of one who was stabbed Feb. 2 and staggered along a street knocking on doors for help before collapsing.

 After a year-long presidential campaign, how long will Americans have to wait Tuesday night to find out who won? Four states where the polls close early could provide the answer. The winner could be known early if Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making a strong showing. But if Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing well, it could be a long night with the result hanging on returns from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The four states cited by election analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> are </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, it's good news for the Democrats,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` Keep tuned. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, it's very good news for the Democrats.'' On the other hand, he said, `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins all of those states, it ought to be a good night for him.'' Of those four states, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has been targeted by both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Both candidates campaigned there Monday, the last of several trips they've made to woo <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> voters. In addition, they've poured a lot of money into advertising and direct mail aimed at <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> voters. Most polls said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leading in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was insisting the margin was closing rapidly. All that attention makes <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> a pretty good barometer of which candidate's appeal got through best to voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said, `` We'll be looking clearly at places like <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. ... We'd like to win, which we think would be a strong signal for us.'' He also cited the big Midwest industrial states, and then `` as we head further out, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'' are states where the Democrat hopes to show strength. Another extremely important state where the polls close early and the vote is tabulated fairly quickly is <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The results from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> should indicate how successful <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at persuading blacks to get out and vote for him. A large black turnout in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is essential for a Democrat to overcome Republican majorities in the city's suburbs and elsewhere in the state. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't get that majority, it would indicate he's probably in trouble wherever black turnout is a factor Other states to watch _ for various reasons _ are <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> should be safe for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But if the outcome is closer than expected it could be a sign of trouble for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The same is true for <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, also considered part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' base, but a state where some polls have said the race was closer than expected. The flip side is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> which is considered reliably in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> column. Should <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pull an upset or even come close, it would indicate he could be headed for an upset. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was considered part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' base early in the campaign, but more recent polls said the contest for the state's 36 electoral votes had narrowed considerably. Hard times and a Democratic tradition made <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> look like a natural for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' populist campaign rhetoric. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory in the state would signal a bad night for the Democrats.

 Tired of paying for expensive deer repellent, some farmers have adopted a substitute that makes for an unusual sight across the countryside _ deodorant soap dangling from trees like Christmas ornaments. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> extension forester, said many subscribe to the old folk remedy that uses small pieces of scented soap to help prevent deer from damaging trees. `` The damage has been increasing every year because the deer population has been exploding,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who has hundreds of small bars of soap hanging from trees on his farm. `` Some deer rub right next to the soap bars, but compared to the damage we used to get, it's less,'' he said. Farmer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holdorff </PERSON> has rigged bars of soap throughout his orchard of 645 black walnut trees about 30 miles southeast of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. He said he does n't mind sharing some of his corn and milo with deer, but needs some form of repellent to protect his small trees. `` Actually, the odor is n't that strong or that repulsive, but apparently the deer do n't like it,'' <PERSON> Holdorff </PERSON> said. `` Their sense of smell is more developed than ours.'' At about 6 or 7 cents for a motel-size bar of soap, the cost is much less than commercial deer repellents, he said. The small bars of soap last through a growing season, he said. September is the best time to place soap in trees, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. One bar per tree should be hung from a branch at about the height of a deer's nose, he said.

<HEAD>Ecologists Divided Over Approaches for Slowing Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ecological doomsayers and wary scientists gathered Monday for a brainstorming session on how to educate people about the consequences of global warming without scaring them. In an address opening the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Climate and Development, former West German Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> spelled out the ecological evils that have plagued the Earth with droughts and floods and threatened ultimate destruction of the environment. He also pointed to the emergence of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the imminent change of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidency as a hope for new attention on the environment. `` I think one should not be too optistimic about it, but regard it as a first step'' that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have made some progress on arms control and regional conflicts, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said at a reception following his speech. Referring to what he and other delegates see as a need to redirect spending from defense to environmental recovery, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said the superpower initiatives `` could lead to substantially more productive talks on transfer of funds from the one to the other.'' The congress, which has drawn more than 400 participants from East and West and from industrialized as well as developing countries, aimed to get the diverse nations and interests working together to slow down a trend that portends drastic environmental change. Former Swedish Prime Minister <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullsten </PERSON> pointed to this year's drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an example of climatic consequences that are `` emptying the world's food baskets. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers are hit by an equally severe drought in 1989, food shortages will result, <PERSON> Ullsten </PERSON> said. `` We are not talking about the distant future, we are talking about next year,'' he warned. While the assembled ecologists were shelled with a barrage of environmental warnings, organizers said the aim of the conference is to work out practical solutions. `` We do not want to create a sense of panic here or a stampede that would have the consequence of limiting action to a small number of countries that have the resources to react,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dortmund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. But he and others concede a sense of urgency must be instilled in the public to counter the `` greenhouse effect'' _ the buildup of gases in the atmosphere that swaddle the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and keep in too much of the sun's heat. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> predicted in a draft report issued last month that the warming trend is expected to raise the average global temperature by 2 to 4 degrees by the middle of the next century. It also could destroy coastline, cut deeply into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop yields and create water and energy crises affecting much of the nation, the report said. New measuring equipment pioneered by Canadian researchers has also disclosed recently that the hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer exposes an area as large as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That gaping hole in the southern seam of the ozone lays bare the unpopulated <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> region. But some scientists fear the northern hemisphere is in for a similar breakdown of the barrier that shields the Earth from the sun's cancer-threataning ultraviolet rays. `` The Antarctic ozone hole is half the world away from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but there is the threat of an Arctic ozone hole developing, and that is close to a lot of Canadians,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, an atmospheric scientist from the Department of the Environment in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The problems, their causes and consequences are clear, the organizers of the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> conference say. What is needed is a plan of action for curbing mankind's polluting habits. Some of the participants, such as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, contend the environmental alarms being set off over global warming are pressuring societies to act without knowing what action to take or whether climatic stability is a desirable objective. `` There are always winners and losers, even in environmental issues,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said at the opening of the four-day congress. `` Many of the predictions have positive consequences for some countries, such as heavier rain in regions that are currently plagued by drought,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A jury on Monday cleared rock star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> of an accusation that he plagiarized one of his own Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for the tune of a recent solo hit. The six-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated less than three hours before ruling unanimously against the copyright infringement claim by <ORGANIZATION> Fantasy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the rights to most of the Creedence songs. The suit claimed `` Old Man Down the Road,'' lead single from <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON>'s comeback `` Centerfield'' solo album in 1985, copied the melody of `` Run Through the Jungle,'' which <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> wrote for Creedence in 1970. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON>'s defense included two days on the witness stand with guitar in hand, playing many of his compositions to demonstrate his style. The 43-year-old musician contended any similarities between the songs were part of his musical style, dubbed `` swamp rock.'' <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> was lead singer and songwriter for Creedence, one of the nation's top rock bands from 1967 to 1972. After the group broke up in 1972, he had no major commercial successes as a solo artist until `` <LOCATION> Centerfield </LOCATION>.'' The suit is one of several legal disputes between <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaentz </PERSON>, principal owner of Fantasy Records. <PERSON> Zaentz </PERSON> has sued <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> for libel over two other songs on `` <LOCATION> Centerfield </LOCATION>,'' one called `` Mr. Greed'' and the other originally titled `` <PERSON> Zanz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kant </PERSON> <PERSON> Danz </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Editorial Boards Uninspired By Campaign, Candidates</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Election Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Editorial boards of the nation's newspapers generally faulted the presidential campaigns of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as negative and uninspiring, and many found the candidates equally disappointing. Some papers declined to make a presidential endorsement. Others voiced strong reservations even while making their choice. The Morning Call of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a less-than inspired choice'' but endorsed him anyway on grounds of his government experience, a view reflected in many editorials. In <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said it was endorsing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat `` despite our uneasiness'' with his leadership style and the `` lack of focus in his campaign.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, referring to its earlier backing of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wrote: `` To those both within and outside the state we urge, do n't make our mistake.'' Some of the sentiment was summed up by the <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, which endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but said, `` Neither candidate has greatly inspired the electorate with his character, ideas or vision.'' The Washington Post endorsed no one and called this year's race `` a terrible campaign, a national disappointment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said it could not `` in good faith argue for the vindication of the cheap shots that have animated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign ... or close our eyes to alarming deficiencies of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate as a prospective president. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> endorsed both candidates after its eight-member editorial board divided down the middle, and said: `` When you add up the pluses and the minuses, the net results do n't overwhelmingly favor one or the other.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said both candidates were better men than had been communicated in a `` sour, superficial, misleading campaign'' and that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is likely to be well served if either man is elected.'' The Times gave its nod to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, based on its expectation that he would be the most effective at `` getting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> out of hock'' from its huge deficits. Many newspapers cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a plus, while others were critical of his selection of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as a running mate and questioned the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee's ability to tame the deficit. The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying: `` An examination of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long record in federal service reads like the curriculum of a preparatory course for the presidency. There are few areas of policy-making in which he is not experienced.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has become a candidate `` who takes the lowest road possible; who pretends, despite all the evidence that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not a callow moron.'' Its sister newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` left no notable legacy'' in his appointive positions and had `` negligible'' impact on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was credited for his leadership record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, but critics questioned his personal compassion and his credentials on foreign policy and national defense. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` emerges as a seasoned leader with growth potential while Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is ever the earnest technocrat. The nation does n't need an ill-defined iceman; it needs a president.'' But the St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` What he may lack in emotional appeal, he more than makes up for in common sense, compassion and commitment.'' <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s largest daily, The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>, said both candidates' campaigns `` have been uninspiring, and often downright disgusting'' but it endorsed Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and welcomed his call for a `` kinder and gentler nation.'' `` We do need a kinder, gentler nation,'' said the <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal. `` That's why we're endorsing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' The Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> also gave the nod to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but said, `` As this unenlightening presidential campaign nears an end, it shows ever more vividly its two main shortcomings: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>'s two largest newspapers _ The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Herald-Leader _ endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with the former voicing concern that on the deficit, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given no indication that he will rise above the expediency of the moment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> broke with a long tradition of endorsing Republican presidential candidates to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` clings to the eight-year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy and promises he would provide four more years of the same. This is not reassuring.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of emotion ... and his seeming inability to respond either quickly or forcefully to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks on his positions have raised legitimate questions about his capacity for timely response in time of crisis.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest paper, the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, expressed its confidence in the vice president: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't really need an endorsement; the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other mainstream states already know the vice president is ready to grasp the reins.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> both backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the latter speculating that `` his appointees to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would not be constitutional extremists.'' Among papers backing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are: The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; The <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>; The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>; The Times of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; The Times-Picayune of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>; The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal; the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>; The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>; The Dallas Morning News; the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>; The Oregonian of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>; the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> -LRB- Neb. -RRB- World-Herald; the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>; The Plain Dealer of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>; and The Detroit News.

<HEAD>Trial Begins in Woman's Suit Against Parole Board for Releasing
Inmate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trial began Monday in the lawsuit of a woman who was shot and paralyzed by a parolee and is now seeking $ 4 million in damages from three state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members. Opening arguments began in the suit of former bank executive <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, who was shot in February 1985 by parolee <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON>. She remains paralyzed from the neck down. If <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> wins her suit, `` not only the <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, but any public official or employee could face far-reaching liability in the course of their duties,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. On May 2, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> has the right to sue the three <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members who voted for <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON>'s parole _ <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Figgs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> One other member voted against parole while a fifth member was not at the meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had overturned a 1986 ruling by Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, who said members were immune under state law because they had acted in their official capacity. <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> was paroled from the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> on Jan. 9, 1985, after serving 12 years and three months of a life sentence for murdering a convenience store clerk. The lawsuit alleged the board did not review his case properly, failing to take into account such things as his behavior in prison and the nature of his original crime. <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> at a parking lot of a bank where she was an assistant vice president. Prosecutors said he thought she was carrying cash from the bank. The 60-year-old <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> is serving a sentence of life without parole at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> for shooting <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON>, said a victory by her client could affect the way criminals are paroled. `` I think the outcome, if we win, will have an effect on the process in the future,'' she said. Problems might not exist `` if the <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was doing what is required by law,'' she said. `` Our position is they are not.''

<HEAD>Gucci Heir Gets Suspended Sentence For Attempted Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>, an heir of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> luxury goods company, was convicted of attempted tax fraud Monday and given a $ 750 fine and a one-year suspended sentence. <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajello </PERSON>, the lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision means <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> will regain control of shares that will give him half of the company. <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON> was accused of having arranged the falsification of the signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by making it appear that his father, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON>, transferred ownership of the shares before his death in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership of the shares was not in question, only when the transfer was made. The court froze the shares to assure he could pay any fine levied in the tax fraud case. He had faced a possible penalty of three years in jail and a fine of about $ 23 million. However, the court fined <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> only $ 750. It also gave him a one-year suspended sentence and said his criminal record will be expunged at the end of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> also must pay the inheritance tax on the shares. The court also convicted <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON>, the notary that authenticated the signatures, of the same charges. The two were given the same suspended sentence and fine. The court also prohibited <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> from acting as a notary for one year. The court also acquitted four others, including a woman accused of actually signing the documents. <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> is the great grandson of <ORGANIZATION> Guccio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, who founded the company in 1922. The company has 180 stores worldwide and its sales last year totaled $ 170 million.

<TEXT>
 A pre-dawn offshore earthquake rattled the westside of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday, but no damage or injuries were reported. The temblor at 5:27 a.m. measured 2.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered one mile southwest of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. `` It was a single jolt,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON>. `` It was like someone bumped into my desk.'' The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took his last, sentimental bow on the campaign stage Monday with a plea for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters to assure a `` new beginning for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by tipping the balance in favor of Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In speeches delivered alongside the retired ocean liner Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and at a rally near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s performing arts center, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saluted old friends, `` freedom fighters'' and political prisoners, and paid a rare public tribute to his parents. `` So now, we come to the end of this last campaign, and I just hope that <PERSON> Nelle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> are looking down on us right now and nodding their heads and saying their boy did them proud,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Likewise, he told his listeners he hoped they would tell their children and grandchildren that `` a certain president came to town at the end of a long journey'' and that `` a century of peace, prosperity, opportunity and hope followed.'' Climaxing 25,000 miles of travel to 16 states on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, the president stressed that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with its 47 electoral votes, could provide the margin of victory for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket in Tuesday's election Recent polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have fought virtually to a draw in the nation's most populous state. `` Today, of course, is the last day of this, my last campaign as president,'' he said in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` But tomorrow launches a new beginning for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They will determine how <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> goes, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> may send the next president to the White House.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was returning Monday night to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where he will watch election returns Tuesday night with friends and political advisers. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there Wednesday. On his arrival at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, reporters asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> what the polls were telling him. The president grinned and replied, `` I'm going to wait and see what that last poll tells me tomorrow. Asked if he had a hunch about the outcome, he replied, `` I'm afraid to say what it is I'm superstitious.'' Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign clearly expected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to provide a crucial boost in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, his speech indicated that his reasons for making the 14-hour round trip between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on election eve were as much personal as political. `` I'm not doing this just for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in his most personal and introspective speech in years. `` I'm doing it for the country of course, but for someone else as well _ actually for two other people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has inserted references to his mother in a few speeches recently, but he has hardly ever spoken publicly of his father, an alcoholic shoe salesman whom he described Monday as `` the best storyteller I've ever heard _ and the strongest man of principle I've ever known.'' The president said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once nearly caught pneumonia sleeping in his car instead of taking a room in the only hotel in town because `` it discriminated against certain groups of people.'' He said that even in the darkest days of the Depression, his parents never refused a meal to anyone who knocked on their door. `` So, you see, I'm also campaigning this year for them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` A son of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never walked away from a battle on principle. This year's election is that kind of fight, and by darn, we're going to win it.'' At the get-out-the-vote rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sounded a bit wistful when he noted that his name wo n't be on the ballot Tuesday. But he said that did n't matter `` because something more important is _ a principle, a legacy.'' He added: `` No, this is not the end of an era; it is a time to refresh and strengthen the ` new beginning' we started eight years ago.'' He said the importance of Tuesday's balloting extended far beyond <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shores. `` Tomorrow on the plains of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in jungles around the world, freedom fighters will huddle close to their radios, hoping to catch word that the administration in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will remain their friend,'' he said. `` In cells across the globe, political prisoners will wait anxiously for assurance that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has chosen strength over weakness, because for many of them, our strength is all that keeps their hopes alive. ... And so help me God, we wo n't let them down,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 An ophthalmologist who pleaded innocent Monday to charges he bilked the Medicare program will be allowed to keep practicing while the matter is pending, a prosecutor said. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 42, described by authorities as the largest Medicaid biller in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, stood quietly as he was arraigned in federal court on the 328-count fraud indictment. He could face penalties of up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count, federal prosecutors said. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, of suburban Indian <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, pleaded innocent on behalf of himself and his company, <ORGANIZATION> Levin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which runs six eye clinics in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. He is accused of billing Medicare for eye operations or other treatments that were not done, or for having told the government he performed tests on both a patient's eyes when only one eye was tested. Prosecutors said there was no evidence his patients were aware of it. The indictment also alleges that <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s company received kickbacks or discounts from companies in connection with purchases of lenses used in cataract surgery, but failed to reduce the lens prices to reflect the discounts when claims were submitted for payment. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> said the case is one of the biggest involving alleged <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> fraud that the government has prosecuted. Federal investigators have n't said publicly how much the alleged fraud amounted to during the four years under investigation. But they said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> has billed Medicare for a total of $ 18 million the past four years. Despite the size of the case, Ms. <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> made no effort Monday to limit <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s right to travel or to restrict his practice while the case is pending. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Aug </PERSON> permitted <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> to remain free on his own recognizance.

<HEAD>Sudan Receiving Military Aid From Libya, Premier Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> received military aid from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to help quell a southern rebellion, but he denied allegations that Libyan troops were fighting alongside the Sudanese army. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> spoke to reporters after a Cabinet meeting Sunday that focused on <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, last week's riots against food shortages and relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Six days of riots that began Oct. 29 in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> injured 58 police officers and five other people, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. The rioting was started by high school students who were later joined by university students and Moslem fundamentalists. Thousands of young people took to the streets of the capital to protest shortages of staples such as bread and sugar, as well as soaring prices. The protesters hurled stones at public buildings, burned tires and clashed with police, who countered with tear gas and batons. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said the rioters destroyed a police station and caused minor damage to the Internal Trade Ministry building. Twenty vehicles, including three private cars, were completely or partially wrecked, he said. <PERSON> Elyaba </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Surur </PERSON>, leader of the opposition Union of Sudanese African Parties, said Sunday that Libyan troops were helping Sudanese soldiers fight the southern rebels, who are mostly Christians and animists demanding greater autonomy from the Moslem-dominated government. <PERSON> Surur </PERSON>, whose union represents a group of southern factions, said the Libyans operate from a headquarters at <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, the capital of the southern region of <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION>. The rebellion, which began in 1983, is costing the government about $ 1 million every day. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> suffers from a chronic shortage of hard currency and has built up a foreign debt of about $ 13 billion, defaulting on repayment. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> acknowledged his government has received military aid from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and other Arab countries, but he denied the presence of Libyan troops in the south. `` Those fighting the -LRB- southern rebellion -RRB- are 100 percent Sudanese troops,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. In 1987, Sudanese officials said four Libyan-supplied MiG-23 warplanes flew combat missions against southern rebels. At least one was reported to have crashed.

<TEXT>
 A Palestinian worker angry over unpaid wages killed a soldier on guard duty at a Jewish settlement Monday and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> farmer shot the assailant to death, witnesses reported. The Palestinian shouted `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>,'' an Islamic war cry meaning `` God is great,'' as he stabbed the soldier, said settlers at the <LOCATION> Massua </LOCATION> cooperative farm 26 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Army spokesmen confirmed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman was shot to death in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. Arab sources said 21 Palestinians were wounded by soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where a revolt against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million Palestinian residents. Hospital officials said two 9-year-olds were among the wounded _ one shot in the leg and the other in the chest. A military court in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> sentenced the leader of a guerrilla squad to three consecutive life prison terms for murdering three other Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A second member of the guerrilla group was sentenced to one life term. Eleven Israelis and at least 309 Palestinians have been killed in the Palestinian uprising, which enters its 12th month Tuesday. The guard at <LOCATION> Massua </LOCATION> was the second soldier killed. According to the army, the 21-year-old attacker approached the soldier about 9 a.m., drew a knife and `` stabbed him repeatedly, at least a dozen times.'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> reported seeing the attack from the nearby farm office. `` In the beginning there was a struggle,'' she said. `` In the end, -LRB- the Arab -RRB- just kept stabbing all the time. He did n't stop. She said a farmer on leave from army reserve duty was with her, ran to get his gun and opened fire after the Palestinian picked up a chair and threatened him. Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said the farmer `` did n't have a choice. He shot him.'' Settlers said the Palestinian attacked after the soldier requested additional identification. The army spokesman said he had worked at the farm and and was angry about not receiving back pay of 170 shekels, about $ 100. The slain soldier was identified as Cpl. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Danieli </PERSON> and the Palestinian's papers said he was <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Basharat </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> village, near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. An area about five yards square was roped off by the time reporters were allowed at the scene, with a chair in the middle where the soldier had sat. A pool of blood was in front of the chair. Underneath it were an overturned thermos, a radio and a book printed in Hebrew. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, army chief of staff, visited <PERSON> Massua </PERSON> after the shooting. Settlers complained to <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> about lack of security and he told reporters in English: `` We can not go on without a proper response to what happened here today.'' <PERSON> Igal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanassy </PERSON>, a 41-year-old farmer, told <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as he left that Palestinians working at the cooperative should be replaced with Jewish volunteers. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he had nothing to do with arranging for volunteers, <PERSON> Hanassy </PERSON> told reporters later. Asked about security, <PERSON> Hanassy </PERSON> replied: `` It's obviously not enough. There was only one soldier at the gate. He was killed.'' The Massua farm, about 18 years old, is a mile from the border opposite a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> village. The settlers grow bananas, grapes, dates and flowers with the help of 100 or so Palestinians who work as day laborers. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> continued competing for the chance to form a government after last week's inconclusive elections. Attacks on Israelis tend to boost the fortunes of hard-liners and a firebomb attack on a bus Oct. 30 that killed a teacher and her three young sons was believed to have cost Labor three seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats, one more than <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, and is given the best chance of making a coaliton with religious and rightist parties. Army spokesmen said soldiers went on the offensive Monday against Palestinian rioters in the occupied territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. They said a 23-year-old woman was killed when soldiers opened fire during a large, violent protest at <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> village 3 miles east of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. A resident reached by telephone at a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> hospital said the dead woman was <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, 20.

<HEAD>Maldives Rebel: Political Ambition Led To Coup Attempt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The alleged leader of a failed coup in <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> said he was motivated by political ambition, Indian television reported Monday. But <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, in a television interview, said he was not entirely responsible for Thursday's aborted attack by an estimated 150 Sri Lankan mercenaries in the Maldivian capital of Male, the television said. Officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in fighting. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> and some mercenaries fled <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> Friday with 27 hostages aboard a cargo ship, but surrendered two days later to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> navy. Doordarshan, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government-owned television, interviewed <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> aboard the Indian frigate Godavari after his capture. Maldivian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Fathulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, once an aide to former President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, conducted operations and directed mercenaries during the coup attempt. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, a businessman, told the television he was not entirely responsible for the decisions, but `` given this opportunity,'' he became politically ambitious. He did not elaborate on who else was responsible. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, whose followers have staged failed coups in 1980 and 1983, has denied involvement. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> was among 46 people on board the cargo ship `` Progress Light'' who surrendered to Indian commandos. The ship, crippled by Indian fire, sank in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on Monday, officials said. When it sank, there were no passengers on board the ship, <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s High Commissioner said. His rank is equivalent to that of an Ambassador. At least four hostages aboard the ship died and 15 were injured before the surrender, the television said. Indian officials would not say how the hostages were killed and injured. Maldivian Transport Minister <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujuthaba </PERSON> was among the injured hostages removed to a hospital in the southern <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION>. In Male, <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> authorities detained more than 100 suspected sympathizers of the coup attempt. `` Searches are being carried out for those suspected to have been left behind by the mercenaries,'' President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> said. Maldivian and Indian officials say most of the 150-member mercenary force escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have been searching the area. The president had requested Indian assistance to quell the coup in his 2,000-island nation. He has vowed to try the mercenaries. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>, 50, was elected president in 1978 after <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> resigned and fled to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, 62, has been accused of misappropriating $ 4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> is scheduled to begin a third term Friday.

<HEAD>Firm Agrees To Pay $50,000 Fine In `Dial-a-Porn' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firm agreed Monday to pay a $ 50,000 fine and stop transmitting obscene messages on interstate telephone lines in a case which the government said signals all `` dial-a-porn'' services that they must act to keep their material inaccessible to children. <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and operator <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> signed the agreement, entailing one the first dial-a-porn fines imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The $ 50,000 payment that the dial-a-porn operator will have to pay to the government ... shows that there will be a high price attached to failure to obey the law scrupulously in this important area,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s common carrier bureau. `` This sends a signal there are some teeth in the law,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. Enforcement of the civil penalty was done `` quickly and efficiently compared with the alternative of extensive and costly litigation,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> officials said <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> is effectively out of business. There was no current listing for the company in telephone information. To resume operations, King or Audio Enterprises must tone down the messages and use access codes, credit cards or scrambling equipment to prevent children under 18 from dialing. Such operations will be monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, according to the agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> launched its investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> after a mother in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wrote that her 13-year-old son and his friends spent $ 74 dialing a pay-to-listen 900-number for 211 minutes. Also listening was the woman's daughter, who was later molested by two boys who had heard the tapes, the woman wrote. `` This phone call has damaged our lives,'' the woman wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> informed <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> last December that it was in apparent violation of <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s rules that require companies to restrict access of obscene material. The commission also informed <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that it was in violation of the law, and that case is still pending. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> determined the material broadcast by the two companies was obscene. Under a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s test, material is obscene if it depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way, appeals to the prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary or artistic value. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> collected about $ 250,000 in revenues over a two-year period. Altogether, the dial-a-porn industry produces about $ 54 million annually in revenue for providers and phone companies, according to the Information Industry Bulletin. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has referred some complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In May 1987, two dial-a-porn providers pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the commission's rule. The court fined them each $ 50,000. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a sweeping dial-a-porn law that bans obscene and indecent commercial messages. The law has not been enforced because of legal challenges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The principal issue centers around the definition of indecent material. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> deems material indecent if it depicts or describes sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently offensive way. The dial-a-porn industry says the definition is too broad and unconstitutional. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed another measure last month, but it has not been signed yet by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stubbornly insisted an election victory was in sight, telling voters there would be `` no surrender'' as he capped his vice presidential campaign Monday with a wild scurry across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and nearby swing states. `` No retreat, baby, no surrender,'' he said, quoting a <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> song as he fired up supporters at an airport hangar in this East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he could `` remember how <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> carried <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' Surrounded by family and political allies, he asserted, `` We carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and we carry it all.'' About 3,000 people cheered the candidate as he spoke in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> park where he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had campaigned together the day after the Democratic National Convention in July. The crowd was even bigger then. `` Are we going to take <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic?'' he said. `` Are we going to elect <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> president and vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spent most of the day working in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> despite polls showing a double-digit lead for the Republicans there, and a recent concession by one of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top aides that the state was lost. `` Go flat out. ... Win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he told supporters at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> rally. `` It's in your hands to win it. You can do it.'' On the stage with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' Union Station was a live quail in a cage. `` How do you like the idea of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> standing in the wings,'' he said, turning his thumb down as the crowd hooted. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> loaded his jet with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state officials, extra staff and actress <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and took off with a loudspeaker in the cabin blaring the theme song from the movie `` Top Gun.'' The unofficial theme song for the former bomber pilot was repeated at rallies throughout the day. He had the plane make a low-altitude pass of the runway before landing in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Then he strolled to the podium as the high school band played, `` Where Is The Love.'' `` The momentum is really going our way,'' he said, chiding Republicans for `` popping their champagne corks'' too early. `` On Nov. 9, they're going to have one of the worst hangovers they've ever had,'' he said. The 67-year-old candidate bounded back up the airplane stairs two steps at a time. After <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had two more stops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> _ before heading to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. He planned to return to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> capital city, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, when the campaign day was to end only a few hours before the polls opened Tuesday. He planned to spend election day in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. He voted by absentee ballot in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> late last month. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued to insist that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its 29 electoral votes are winnable for the Democrats, even though many polls show him and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing by double digits. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> headquarters added two more stops outside of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s schedule for Monday: <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The campaign also considered sending <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he has campaigned frequently. Although several state campaigns were trying to get him to appear on the eve of the election, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he insisted that he wrap up his effort in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, it was a day for hammering at the same themes that he's used for weeks: attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as running mate and echoing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' new populist theme of `` We're on your side, and they're not.'' He also jabbed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, implying again that the vice president was not a true Texan, as he claimed. Nearly 200 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks have failed in the past few years, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of doing nothing for his claimed home state while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was helping bankers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We want a Texan in there who's interested in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` We're going to help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state agriculture commissioner who joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s entourage Monday, said the senator was doing what he needed to do even though the polls looked bad. `` We're not sitting and being poll watchers, but trying to be pole vaulters,'' he said. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said the populist message <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was now using on the stump should have come three months earlier and it may be too late. `` We're pedaling uphill with not very many minutes left,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Faults State Department for Not Renewing Checks on Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional investigators on Monday faulted the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for failing to update security checks on thousands of long-term department employees who have access to top secret information. The department `` has not reinvestigated about 75 percent of its 9,000 long-term employees in critical-sensitive positions, those who had been working with the department for five or more years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. The number of people not reinvestigated after five years was 6,739, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which is the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` About 44 percent of those eligible have not been reinvestigated in the past 10 years or longer, and dozens of employees have not been reinvestigated in 25 years or more,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The number not reinvestigated after 10 years was 3,908. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who requested the study, said, `` Just because an individual was a good security risk five years ago does n't mean he still is.'' `` As espionage cases of the past few years have clearly demonstrated, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees with security clearances and access to classified information are prime targets for recruitment by foreign intelligence operatives,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had no comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security investigators devote most of their energy to people seeking employment, and were failing to meet their own goal of completing such reviews within 90 days. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took an average of 140 days for such pre-employment investigations, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A major reason for the accumulated backlog is the low priority the department has given reinvestigations,'' the report said. `` State has not focused on reinvestigations but instead has used its investigative resources primarily on ` suitability reviews,' which are used to reduce the number of applicants for foreign service positions. `` In essence, State has been giving a higher priority to investigating a large number of people who will never be hired rather than to investigating people already in sensitive jobs,'' it said. Among the employees the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> failed to investigate as required after five years were: _ A science officer who had top secret clearance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> matters and to coding information violated department regulations in 1982 by traveling to a Soviet bloc country without authorization `` Also in 1982, while the employee was assigned to a post in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> learned of his homosexual orientation and, threatening disclosure, sought to recruit him as a spy.'' No reinvestigation was ever done on this employee. His clearances were pulled after he allegedly engaged in a homosexual encounter with a minor. _ An economic affairs officer, hired in 1973, was criticized for violating security procedures in 1979 for leaving classified material unattended on his desk He also violated department policies by having affairs with Soviet and Czechoslovak women. The employee's security clearance was not lifted until he was arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in January 1986 for allegedly trying to manufacture the illegal drug LSD. _ An employee who received a security clearance in 1980 had his clearance suspended after he sired a child by an East German woman He had not been reinvestigated as required in 1985.

 With the blessings of a bishop and the salutes of nearly 1,000 police officers, the city buried a police recuit Monday who died 44 days after collapsing on his first day of training, a session that sparked turmoil in the state's law enforcement agencies. Hundreds of residents, unable to get in the packed 1,500-seat church, lined both sides of the main street outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as the Most Rev <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, Roman Catholic bishop of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said the funeral Mass for 25-year-old <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> did not quite realize his desire to be a police officer, but perhaps in God's mysterious plan he may have had a higher role,'' the bishop said. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s illness and the hospitalization of 15 other cadets in late September led to at least three state probes, the resignation of the head of the state's police training programs, and the transfer of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> instructors and the director of the <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> academy where the cadet collapsed. The service was broadcast on loudspeakers, and there was bitterness and sadness on the faces of the residents who stood in the chilly November drizzle for more than two hours. Many residents, such as <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibbee </PERSON>, had not known the young man, who was married in June and whose wife is pregnant. But they knew he was the most seriously stricken of the cadets who were hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration following a grueling regimen of laps and pushups on a few cups of water. `` It's so senseless. What did they think they were doing with that training?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kibbee </PERSON> said. `` Your heart ca n't help but go out to that poor boy's family.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Riello </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s death has created ambivalence in the force about training methods. `` The mood in the department is extremely sullen,'' he said. `` The problem we have in dealing with it -LRB- <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s death -RRB- is that it is so senseless. It should n't have happened.'' The last <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> officer to die in the line of duty was killed in 1898 while pushing a woman and her children to safety off the tracks of an oncoming train. The funeral cortege, the largest ever in this city of 50,000 people, took nearly 15 minutes to pass. Two <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> police cruisers led the way, followed by motorcycle officers, mounted police and more than 100 cruisers from <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Schnectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Their lights flashed in a sea of twinkling blue and red as they slowly passed the silent crowd. State Police were represented by three cruisers. They had scaled back plans for six cruisers when <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s family asked that they not attend because of bitterness over his training by state troopers. The family withdrew the request Sunday, according to Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>. `` They reconsidered and agreed that there are many fine and compassionate state policemen and they should be made welcome,'' she said. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed Sept. 19 from heat stroke and was flown to a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital while still in a coma for a liver transplant. The cadet had emerged from a coma after two weeks and was slowly recovering _ even writing his wife, `` I made it'' _ when he fell unconscious again Oct. 31 and was rushed into emergency surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain. He was pronounced dead Wednesday. An autopsy indicated he died from infections that set in because of his weakened condition. His death is the subject of an inquest later this month to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the instructors.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grew $1.9 Billion In September</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 1.88 billion more in consumer debt than they paid off in September, the smallest advance in 10 months, the government reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that the September increase in consumer debt was down from an August rise of $ 5.32 billion and was the smallest monthly advance since a $ 1.79 billion rise in November 1987. While much of the decline in September was traced to weak auto sales, economists said that the pattern of the past several months showed that consumers had grown more cautious in their buying plans. From July through September, consumer debt rose at an annual rate of 6.75 percent, down significantly from a 10.2 percent growth rate in the first six months of the year. `` Consumer debt in the third quarter grew at one of the slowest rates of this recovery,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` There are increasing signs that consumers are becoming more cautious as they cut back on spending and try to reduce their debt loads.'' Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the consumer slowdown is a primary reason he is looking for economic growth next year to be less than half of this year's pace. The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, is expected to rise by 3.8 percent this year, the best performance since 1984. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> predicted 1989 growth would be a lackluster 2 percent. For September, auto loans edged up a modest $ 49 million following a $ 2.2 billion increase in August. The big drop in auto loans reflected the absence of widespread auto sales incentive programs, the government said. These programs to reduce swollen inventories had boosted sales in the three previous years. The category which includes credit card debt rose by $ 1.5 billion in September, down from a $ 2.6 billion August increase. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate edged up $ 342 million, compared to an August increase of $ 449 million, while loans for mobile homes actually fell by $ 29 million following a $ 33 million increase in August. The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally adjusted $ 655.2 billion in September. Total consumer debt was 8.6 percent higher than a year ago.

 A passenger train traveling from <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> hit a maintenance car on a service track Monday and derailed in a village station in northeastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, killing nine railroad employees. No passengers were killed. Twelve passengers were injured along with the driver of the train, but none seriously. The accident occurred on a track at Ay, a village near <LOCATION> Epernay </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The maintenance car was on the service track, and it was not immediately clear why the passenger train was directed that way, where railway employees were working, rather than on the main line through the station. `` There were bodies everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Dequeninque </PERSON>, owner of a cafe next to the station. `` The nine workers working on the track were all killed.'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, president of the national railway, the <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francais </ORGANIZATION>, said the train was traveling at 73 mph when it struck the maintenance car. The locomotive and nine of 11 passenger cars left the rails. <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON> said a rarely used switch apparently had been thrown to permit maintenance work on the track. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON>, who visited some of the injured at a local hospital, said an investigation would be launched.

 A Fijian soldier of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was wounded in a shootout Monday with Shiite Moslem militiamen, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the peacekeeper was shot in the chest during a 20-minute firefight with six gunmen of the Syrian-backed Amal militia in <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baal </LOCATION>, six miles southeast of the southern port city of Tyre. The sources said the shooting broke out when soldiers manning a Fijian checkpoint in <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Baal </PERSON> tried to prevent the militiamen from driving their green <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> station wagon into U.N.-policed territory with their arms. `` When the Fijian checkpoint told them they can not cross, they headed for a dirt road. A Fijian soldier fired a warning shot in the air,'' one source said. `` The armed elements apparently thought they were under fire, so they shot back and a firefight ensued in which one armed element also was slightly wounded.'' The wounded Fijian was flown by helicopter to the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> for treatement at a field hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said.

 Lebanese hijacking suspect <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was identified in court Monday by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> college student as the leader of `` a horde of men'' who seized a Jordanian jetliner at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport in 1985. `` I recognize him as the leader of the hijackers,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> testified, pointing his finger at the bearded, black-haired defendant seated in the courtroom. `` How sure are you about that?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissette </PERSON>. `` Positive,'' replied <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, the first victim of the hijacking to publicly identify <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as leader of the group of five men who stormed the Royal Jordanian airliner with AK-47 assault rifles on June 11, 1985. The 21-year-old witness, testifying at a pre-trial hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> emerge from the cockpit 10 times during two-day hijacking when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jet was forced to fly to several points in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I shook his hand at the end of the ordeal,'' <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> said, recalling he looked the hijacker in the eye as he was leaving the aircraft. `` I was very close to him.'' The plane was blown up at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport shortly after the the 72 passengers and crew members were allowed to leave it. The aircraft was seized as it prepared to take off for <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` About two minutes before takeoff, I heard a great deal of gunfire outside the aircraft,'' <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> testified. `` A whole horde of men stormed onto the airplane.'' `` My gut instinct was to duck, I crouched into my chair,'' he recalled. The group started `` beating everything in their way onto the floor.'' All of the hijackers, except their leader, attacked a group of five or six Jordanian sky marshals and `` proceeded to beat them thoroughly and torture them,'' he said. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> testified that the hijacker's leader spent most of the time in the airplane's cockpit but came back to the passenger cabin about 10 times, mostly to order his men to stop beating the sky marshals. When he returned to the cockpit, the hijackers `` would start laughing and begin doing it again.'' None of the passengers was ever beaten or threatened with violence, <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> testified that he identified a photograph of the defendant that was shown to him by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in June 1987 _ three months before <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> aboard a government-chartered yacht off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, who is awaiting trial on hijacking charges, was lured to the yacht by the prospect of completing a drug deal. The man <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> identified as the leader of the hijackers was `` dressed in a flak jacket with a black headband around his head'' and wore green pants. The defendant was `` heavily armed'' and wore `` a vest that contained ammunition clips as well as hand grenades,'' <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> said he could tell the man was the leader of the group because he stayed mostly in the cockpit and was the only hijacker who carried a two-way radio. Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> called the hearing to determine whether the eyewitness identification of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> by <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> and five other witnesses can be admitted into evidence. The trial had been scheduled to begin Nov. 14, but has been postponed indefinitely while prosecutors appeal a pre-trial order by the judge. Prosecutors want to challenge a ruling by <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> that they produce classified documents and tape recordings of conversations between <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant that <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled the defense was entitled to inspect. A federal appeals court is not expected to consider the issue until January, so the trial is not expected to begin until late winter at the earliest. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, a college student, testified he was traveling with his father, <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, a former professor at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, when the plane was hijacked. The elder <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> is also expected to testify at the hearing, which is expected to last several days. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, a college student, declined to say exactly where he lived, saying: `` I'd rather not reveal that right now.'' But he reluctantly confirmed during cross-examination by defense lawyer <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that he lived in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

High temperatures were expected to range from the 40s to the 80s. `` There's nothing terribly strong out there, no blizzards or downpours or flooding,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no bitter cold that might keep people in.'' <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said his advice to voters was: `` Everybody get out there and have at it.'' Only about 50 percent or less of eligible voters were expected to vote this year.

 One of 16 criminal charges against former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was dismissed Monday, without opposition from the prosecution in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed a charge that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had fabricated documents to hide from investigators the fact that arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had paid for the installation of a $ 13,800 security fence outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s home in suburban <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The defense had contended that North could not be charged with obstruction of justice because the alleged fabrication did not occur while a grand jury was investigating the Iran-Contra affair. North was charged with fabricating the documents in December, 1986, a month before the special federal grand jury that investigated the case was convened. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> consented to the dismissal of the charge in a response to the defense motion. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed the charge, which carried a potential five-year prison term and a $ 250,000 fine, noting the `` lack of opposition'' from prosecutors. But the judge denied a defense motion to dismiss a related count charging North with illegally accepting payment for the installation of the fence. The defense contended that the charge should only be tried in federal court across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. North, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, is charged with conspiring to defraud the government by illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Suspending Withdrawal Does Not Violate Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Soviet decision to suspend its military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> does not violate the U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, the chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday. `` The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements are being implemented. ... At the moment, there is no violation of the agreement,'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, told reporters. He was asked at the regular daily briefing whether <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had any comment on the Soviet announcement Friday that it was suspending withdrawal because of <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan guerrillas. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said: `` There is no comment because under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements that is envisaged.'' Asked to explain, he said: `` What is envisaged ... is that troops be withdrawn by the 15th of February, 1989, and that half of them be withdrawn by the 15th of August, and this has been done.'' `` They have said they are suspending their troop withdrawal,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. `` That is not a violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements. ... The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements are being implemented. At the moment, there is no violation of the agreement.'' In its announcement Friday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it still hopes to have its troops out by Feb. 15. Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began last May 15. When asked about a statement by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that the supply of arms to guerrillas by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` practically torpedoes'' the accords, he replied: `` The secretary-general hopes and is confident that the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements would be implemented.'' In an interview published Monday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> demanded a halt in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani aid to the Moslem insurgents. <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION>, the official Afghan news agency, quoted him as saying: `` We have stated on more than one occasion that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will not remain indifferent to the incessant violations of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. A joint Soviet-Afghan decision to suspend the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a response to it. The ... opposition must stop the armed struggle.'' He said new, heavier weapons brought in by the Soviets were for defensive purposes, `` intended not for threatening anyone but for suppressing the hotbeds of resistance of the armed opposition.'' Sophisticated MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1 Scud missiles have been sighted in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says their presence raises questions of whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intends to comply with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> withdrawal agreement. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had not yet read the text of statement the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued Friday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has criticized the 50-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force sent to monitor the withdrawal and investigate possible violations by either side. The Soviets have asked for a report on the work of the observers, who the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says are not doing their job. The agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors, provides for troop withdrawal and non-interference in internal affairs. The guerrillas were not a party to the negotiations and continued to fight. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says the arming of insurgents by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violates the agreement. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says the Soviets violated it by providing more arms to the Afghan army and introducing the new weapons.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> met for five hours Monday in their longest face-to-face session since peace negotiations began Aug. 25, but the Iranian delegate described it as `` long talks, no progress.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> described the encounter between <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> respectively, as a `` helpful meeting'' in a `` businesslike atmosphere.'' He said another session would be held Tuesday. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said he would send a letter to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> calling his attention to a statement by the `` commander of the Iranian guards'' who he said had urged that reinforcements be sent to the front. He did not identify the commander. `` We feel this statement is a very grave one,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. `` I made it clear to the Iranian and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegations that if the Iranian side is using any threats nobody is afraid.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> went to war in September 1980 and at least 1.5 million people were killed or wounded before a cease-fire began Aug. 20. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had not reinforced its positions on the 730-mile border front but had new weapons to use `` against external aggression.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers are stationed between the two armies along the border. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters negotiations remained stuck on point one of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which covers withdrawal of forces to `` internationally recognized borders.'' The cease-fire resolution also provides for prisoner exchange and peace negotiations. In an interview with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said no Iranian troops were left on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory but Iraqi forces occupy nearly 400 square miles of Iranian land. The southern border is the most contentious issue because it falls in the disputed Shatt-al-Arab, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea. Just before the war started, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated a 1975 treaty that draws the line down the middle of the waterway. It wants the line returned to the Iranian shore, as it was before the treaty. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> considers the treaty still valid. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> offered a compromise last month calling for military disengagement and exchange of the estimated 100,000 prisoners, combined with dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab and an Iranian pledge to stop searching ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for war-related cargo. The waterway, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> calls the <LOCATION> Arvan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is blocked by ships stranded by the war, unexploded shells and silt that collected during eight years. An <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediators must produce new ideas `` if they want the talks to move ahead and out of the current relative deadlock.''

 FERE-EN-TARDENOIS, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Peace talks among Cambodian factions made no substantial progress Monday but the leaders agreed to meet again and to establish a working committee of their representatives, officials reported. The talks in this village 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> are to end Tuesday. Attending the conference are neutralist Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of a loose alliance of three resistance groups fighting the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government; anti-communist Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and communist Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The fourth Cambodian faction, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, had been invited but the three other leaders rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed envoy, <PERSON> Ok </PERSON> <PERSON> Saukun </PERSON> who is <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization They said he was not qualified for a `` summit'' meeting. The three agreed to meet again in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> early next year. The resistance groups fighting the government are <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s supporters, Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s guerrillas and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s son and spokesman, said <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s position had hardened. He said the Cambodian government wanted to link the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops to an end to foreign aid to the resistance groups. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must take place before any aid to the resistance is ended. `` It is unacceptable to put the foreign occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the just resistance of the people on the same level,'' <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> told reporters. `` We will not compromise.'' Another main point of disagreement is the dismantling of the Cambodian regime. It was installed by the Vietnamese after they invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in Decemer 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> that had defeated the U.S.-backed government in 1975 at the end of the Indochinese war. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians perished during the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> effort to destroy all opposition and create a rural society. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is demanding the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government be replaced by a four-party administration. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has indicated the status quo be maintained until `` free and democratic elections'' can be held. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> believe that no agreement will work that leaves out the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which has the strongest military force in the resistance. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s position is that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> must first be disarmed to avoid another civil war. `` On these essential points divergences remain,'' said <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>.

 A powerful earthquake struck just inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s mountainous southern border, and two official radio stations reported Monday that 600 people were killed Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the Peoples' Central Broadcasting Station quoted the same reporter, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, about the death toll. Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also quoted him as saying most of the dead were in <LOCATION> Shanmato </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province that was nearly wiped out by the earthquake, which registered 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Hu's account could not be confirmed independently. An earlier Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> report said total casualties were 600, including dead and injured. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which had reported 18 killed and 54 injured, said it had no new figures. Dispatches from the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said at least 37 people were dead and more than 100 injured. No telephone service was available to the affected part of <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province near the Burmese border. It is sparsely inhabited by farmers, many from the Lahu and Va minorities with their own languages and live in houses of wood and mud. A <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> official reached by telephone said the provincial government had no idea how many people were killed. Asked whether 600 was a plausible, he said: `` It might be. It might not be.'' If the death toll of 600 is accurate, this would be <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake since the 1976 tremor that hit the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION>. Officials say 242,000 died, but unofficial estimates put the death toll as high as 800,000. That quake measured 7.8 to 8.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake. Each number on the scale indicates a tenfold increase in strength and a temblor of 7 can cause heavy damage in populated areas. Following Sunday's quake, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said dozens of aftershocks had struck the <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> region through Monday night, with the strongst measuring 7.2 but most ranging from 4.0 to 6.0. Roads to the affected area were cut and <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> authorities ordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies. The provincial government said early Tuesday that doctors had set out for the area and the governor, He Zhiqiang, was en route. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ordered a delegation led by State Councilor <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON> to visit the site and oversee rescue work. It said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> issued a statement expressing sympathy and concern for victims and their families. The quake was centered in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Menglian </LOCATION> counties, about 240 miles southwest of the provincial capital <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said most houses in the two counties were demolished and buildings were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties. Roads to the region were cut but crews were working to repair them, the agency said. A journalist who has visited the region said many homes were built on stilts because of periodic heavy rains and probably would collapse in such a strong earthquake. Seismologists in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> reported no damage in the city of 1.5 million. Three years ago, a quake of 6.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed 22 people and injured 300 in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>. A quake of 5.0 occured Oct. 15 in southern <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION>, which experiences tremors frequently, but there were no reports of casualties. A powerful temblor hit far western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday and seismologists said they did not know whether the <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> quake was related to it. The Saturday tremor, measuring 7.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was centered in an uninhabited area of the <LOCATION> Tanggula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province and northern <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> said they had no reports of casualties. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is one of the most earthquake-prone countries and seismologists predicted in 1985 that activity would increase through the end of the century. The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985, when a temblor of 7.4 killed 71 people and injured 125 in the far-western <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> Uygur Autonomous Region.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Monday authorizing a two-year, $ 1.2 billion program for the homeless, saying it would permit the government to `` address effectively the plight of those who do not have shelter.'' The bill authorizes $ 633.8 million for the current fiscal year and $ 675.8 million for the fiscal year that will begin next Oct. 1. `` It ensures that the federal government, directly and through cooperative efforts with state and local governments and the private sector, can address effectively the plight of those who do not have shelter,'' the president said. Funds are authorized for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which aids the work of non-profit organizations and local governments in providing shelter, food and other services. Money also will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> for grants for renovation of buildings for use as emergency shelters and for their operation. `` The act authorizes funds for a program of particular importance that serves both the medical needs of the homeless and the national objective of a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said he referred to a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> program of grants to public or private nonprofit organizations for health and substance abuse services for the homeless.

 Black leaders expressed confidence Monday that blacks would turn out to vote in large numbers, despite a presidential campaign widely regarded as lackluster. They predicted get-out-the-vote efforts by Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, black churches and other organizations will produce a tunout as large or nearly as large as in 1984, when blacks turned out in record numbers. Many analysts are predicting the overall turnout Tuesday will be less than the 53 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults who cast their ballots in 1984, and some believe blacks will not turn out for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as strongly as they did for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, who got 90 percent of the black vote in 1984. Blacks make up 11.1 percent of the adult population and have voted overwhelmingly Democratic since the New Deal. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, executive director of the Committee for the Study of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electorate </ORGANIZATION>, said registration is down among blacks and `` I ca n't conceive of black turnout not being lower than in'84.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said black voters in 1984 `` had a feeling of affection'' for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` I do n't see that they feel that way for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said. `` He was the fellow who beat their man -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB-.'' Many <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters were upset last July when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to notify <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beforehand that he had chosen <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for his running mate. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has crisscrossed the country on behalf of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, logging 55,700 miles and addressing 745,000 people in 191 events in 29 states, according to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokesman. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has done everything he could to say to black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that he is not mad about that, and even if he were, that the states are still too high for that to be a reason for blacks not going to the polls.'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> predicted the black vote will be at least as large as it was in 1984. `` There has been a tremendous amount of work going on around the country on the part of the black infrastructure _ black churches, <PERSON> black </PERSON> community organizations _ that is not getting visible media attention,'' he said. The Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We've had a fairly unexciting campaign in turning people on to vote.'' `` There was a period when many black people felt let down,'' said Hooks, but he added that grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s constant campaigning have turned that around. `` I think that black voter turnout will be substantial, but perhaps not as large as it could have been had there been more coverage of issues and of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said Hooks. He predicted it would be `` very close to the'84 turnout.'' Hooks said that in states with significant black populations, `` wherever <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running a tight race with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the white community, black voters ... could be the deciding factor.'' Pollster <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said his organization, which conducts polls for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, found no evidence in its final pre-election survey of any likely drop in black turnout. After interviewing nearly 700 blacks in a survey group of 6,613, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said, `` we have absolutely no evidence that there's a -LRB- black -RRB- turnout drop at all.''

 Sikh gunmen shot and killed an Indian army general in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state Monday, police said. Five days of Sikh separatist violence left at least 79 people dead in the northern Indian state. Maj. Gen. B.N. <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, a Hindu, was shot in the head by two Sikh gunmen as he left his home in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> to go to his office, a police spokesman said. The assailants, who were waiting in a car, fired 40 to 45 rounds and escaped, said the spokesman, who under regulations can not be not identified. <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, 56, was serving on the <ORGANIZATION> Bhakra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which overlooks the work of the Bhakra Nangal Dam. The dam, one of the largest in the world, is in neighboring <LOCATION> Himachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state but provides irrigation water for a vast area of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bhakra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nangal </PERSON> is 93 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The motive behind the killing was not immediately known, but several sources said Sikh radicals had vowed to kill officers of the board. The radicals have accused the board of suddenly releasing water from the dam in September without any advance warning, causing floods. <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> denied the charge Oct. 17 in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. At least 702 people died and 192 are still missing in the floods that forced tens of thousands of people out of their homes. Sikh radicals are campaigning for an independent Sikh homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, claiming they are discriminated against by the Hindus, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s religious majority, and need a way to maintain their cultural and religious traditions. Sikhs account for only two percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, while the Hindus make up about 82 percent. However, Sikhs are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. On Thursday, Sikh radicals ambushed a bus and killed 11 people in <LOCATION> Gujarpura </LOCATION>. On Friday, they exploded seven bombs in a crowded market in <LOCATION> Batala </LOCATION>, killing 28 people and wounding 50 others. Also Friday, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> gunmen attacked a seed farm near <LOCATION> Lawdohwal </LOCATION>, killing 20 Hindus. In other attacks, Sikh radicals killed 14 people across the state on late Friday and Saturday. On Sunday, Sikh radicals killed five people in the state.

 Questions about safety and drug use linger at the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Fairless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Works </LOCATION>, where last month a crane operator suffocated after a plunge into a bin of iron-ore pellets the size of jelly beans The <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the Oct. 2 death of R.B. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Levittown </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> reportedly hired nine undercover agents to probe alleged drug use at the suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> plant. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has testified he pressed the button that dropped <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> into a funnel filled with the iron-ore pellets. The funnel opens from the bottom into a car that transfers ore to a blast-furnace bin. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 28, had been on the job just four days at the time of the accident. `` It's not a whodunit,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. `` We know how it happened and who was responsible. The only question that remains is, ` Is it criminal?''' The answer depends on whether illegal drugs contributed directly to the fatality. A test found trace amounts of cocaine and marijuana in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> three hours after the accident, too little to prove he was criminally impaired, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. A second review of the test results is under way. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> contends the fatality was simply a horrible accident caused by a confusing situation in an unfamiliar environment. He had only had two hours of supervised training for the job. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> had stepped from his cab to clean the windows, standing on iron-ore pellets to reach the glass, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> announced in a statement the day after the accident. He had asked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who operated the transfer cars, not to dump the funnel until he was finished, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said in Monday editions. The newspaper said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> testified during dismissal hearings that he either forgot or misunderstood the request. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment Monday on the nature of the dismissal hearings or whether <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is still employed at <LOCATION> Fairless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Works </LOCATION>. `` We're basically taking a pass on all this questioning, because we have an ongoing investigation there,'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. According to the Inquirer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> checked `` yes'' on an application when asked if he had ever used drugs. The form then asked `` What kind?'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> wrote: `` Pot.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> will determine whether <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> management was responsible for the fatality, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Skladitis </PERSON>, director of the Philadelphia-area <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> office. The questions the agency will answer include whether <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> hired a man who should have been rejected, whether he received proper training and whether safe procedures existed for the window cleaning. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has the power to levy fines when it finds negligence. Since the death, the company has given crane operators instructions on how to clean their cabs safely and has issued padlocks to lock the bottom of the funnel before windows are cleaned. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> has an ongoing safety program at <LOCATION> Fairless </LOCATION>, and changes are made whenever investigation of an accident determines a cause that can be remedied.

 <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> ignored the blinding lights of television cameras and passed his oral English and civics tests with flying red-white-and-blue colors Monday, becoming the first amnesty recipient in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to earn permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residency. The 31-year-old San Angelo ranchhand, wearing a blue bandana around his neck and clanking spurs on his dusty boots, calmly recited the colors of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, explained what the flag's 13 stripes symbolize, told how many states are in the union, identified <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the president and defined the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. After filling out a short test with similar questions and having his fingerprints taken, the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> was given his permanent residency card. `` I was n't scared of ... any questions,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said as he gazed at the card. `` It's just exciting, I guess, getting something like this. It's liberty for me.'' Joining <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> as first-day permanent residency recipients were <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Helguera </PERSON> <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feliciana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. All three entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally and were among the first in line in May 1987 to apply for amnesty from deportation under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That allowed them to be among the first to apply for permanent residency under the second phase of the amnesty program. All three entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for different reasons and all three qualified for permanent residency under different criteria. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, who took that name after he got to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 15 years ago, refused to divulge the name he was born with. He said he was born in a town about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> called Golubinci Stara Pazova. At 16, he joined the merchant marine and got work aboard a ship that cruised up the St. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaway </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He got off the ship in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and never got back on. `` I left for political reasons,'' he said. `` I believe in liberty, and I've always believed in God. I'm Catholic.'' <PERSON> Helguera </PERSON>, a well-service worker in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, got permanent residency by showing that he had taken English and civics classes at <ORGANIZATION> Odessa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The 28-year-old native of <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nine years ago to seek work. `` In the nine years, they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- stopped me only once,'' he said. `` They gave me 15 days to leave, but I did n't leave. His wife, <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON>, said she plans to apply for permanent residency in a few months, when she becomes eligible. Mrs. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> with her daughter, <PERSON> Ofelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON>, in 1978. The 88-year-old native of Hidalgo de Parral, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, was exempt from the English and civics requirement because of her age. `` I'm glad and very thankful,'' she said of getting permanent residency. All three said they plan to apply for citizenship. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, a staunch supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, seemed the most eager to become a citizen. Because he is married to an American citizen, he most likely will be able to vote for president in 1992. Asked if he wished he could vote in the 1988 presidential election, <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said: `` Oh, you bet, of course. I sure hope Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win tomorrow.''

 A Communist-led mass organization said Monday the president of the Slovenian republic should be punished for allegedly anti-Serbian statements he made on a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Action against <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> should be taken by the nation's highest ruling bodies, the collective federal presidency and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION>, said a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> carried by the official news ageny <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> In remarks last Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> said protests inspired by inflation and <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> nationalism a month ago had threatened the stability of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Mass rallies in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the nation's largest republic, involved hundreds of thousands of people supporting <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s campaign for more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, two largely autonomous provinces that are part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which is strongly influenced by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s policies, said <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> misinformed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public and his views `` differed from reality.'' <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> is the capital of both <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the possibility of ethnic disturbances crossing into the republic of <LOCATION> Bosnia-Hercegovina </LOCATION>, a fragile mixture of Moslem, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> faiths, prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through the national party on matters normally reserved for regional authorities.

 Nicaraguan guerrillas will demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president-elect quickly reveal whether he will support their struggle to overthrow the Sandinista government, a rebel leader said Monday. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, a member of the directorate of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance organization, also said the rebels hope to obtain renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid if Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected president on Tuesday `` We will meet with the transition team of the new -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- president and demand a clear definition over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The right-wing rebels, known as Contras, want `` to determine if the new government of either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or -LRB- Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will continue to support the war to defeat once and for all the Sandinista government,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has backed the rebels, known as Contras, since 1981 in their bid to overthrow the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The majority of the Contras fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in recent months to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid expired in February. The Contras currently are drawing from a $ 27 million humanitarian aid package approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said the Contras would reject <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid if it is provided only to pressure the Sandinista government into making democratic reforms. `` We can not allow our people to continue to sacrifice themselves just to keep pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. That is immoral,'' he said. The Sandinistas and rebels signed a cease-fire pact in March. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has extended the cease-fire on a monthly basis through the end of November, while the Contras say the cease-fire is indefinite. Each side accuses the other of truce violations.

<HEAD>One-day Strike Disrupts Government Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of civil servants struck for one day Monday to protest dismissal of union workers at an intelligence headquarters, disrupting such government offices as welfare and driving-test centers. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a mass rally of civil servants in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: `` We believe that solidarity, like liberty, must be indivisible. And we believe that solidarity, like charity, begins at home.'' The rally was one of about 60 held to protest the firings of five men at the Government Communications Headquarters, a huge facility at <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that monitors transmissions from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says its work is too sensitive to risk disruption by strikes. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> greeted 2,500 civil servants in Polish and said: `` I do it in that way because we have solidarity with the belief that the freedoms of organization, assembly and expression must know no boundaries. `` We do n't just want freedom in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, we want it in <ORGANIZATION> GCHQ </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't just want dialogue and freedom to choose in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, we want it in <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last week and met with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, founder of the outlawed independent union movement Solidarity. After Labor made the comparison again later Monday, in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Civil Service Minister <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> responded: `` Do n't you understand the difference between true democracy, with freedom under the law, with a freely elected parliament `` National security has to come first, and the <ORGANIZATION> GCHQ </ORGANIZATION> needs to operate on a continuous basis if they are to be effective.'' The five men were fired for flouting a 1984 ban on unions at the facility. Twelve other men face retirement, compulsory transfer or dismissal. They were the holdouts among one-third of the 7,000 employees who were union members in 1984. Others accepted payment of 1,000 pounds each -LRB- then worth $ 1,400 -RRB- for quitting their union. None of the rebels was fired until this year, but union officials said the government tried to freeze them out with such tactics as refusing pay raises. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s eight civil service unions, said `` 80 percent-plus walkouts'' closed many employment and welfare offices, state-run job and driving-test centers Civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices, prisons, airports and magistrate courts, and spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenefeck </PERSON> said: `` We're thinking 200,000 is not a bad estimate'' for the number of strikers.

 <LOCATION> FORT </LOCATION> <LOCATION> WAYNE </LOCATION>, Ind. -LRB- A -RRB- _ Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` finally at home'' in his native <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, got a hero's welcome Monday night as he concluded an occasionally rocky campaign for the vice presidency. In a boisterous rally that took on the flavor of a political convention, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, thanked a crowd of about 2,000 for supporting him through times of tribulation. `` There have been weeks of wild exhilaration along with personal testing, and we knew you were there,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, without referring specifically to the controversy that swirled about him in the days following his Aug. 17 nomination by the Republican National Convention to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. `` My fellow Hoosiers, I am finally at home,'' he said. `` It is here, with your help, that I entered public service.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been besieged by questions from news organizations about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at the height of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war in 1969 and the question of whether he benefited by undue influence in getting admitted into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school with a `` C'' average on undergraduate work at <ORGANIZATION> Depauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must `` say good night'' to Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if they want to save the changes wrought during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight years in office. During a rally at an aiport hangar in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, nestled in the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, he declared: `` Let me say to the citizens of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not on your side.'' The 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, confident about the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket's election prospects Tuesday, told reporters he was satisfied with the way he handled his role as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate and is ready for the voters' verdict Borrowing a slogan used by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s tourist industry, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` knows that <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is for lovers, not liberals.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' populist `` on your side'' campaign theme. `` He's on your back,'' the senator said. `` He's in your pocket. And on Tuesday night, he's out of luck. And that's when we'll be saying, ` Say good night, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'.'' Touring a <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> electronics plant near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters the Republican ticket had `` a really good shot'' in heavily Democratic <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, `` and if we can win <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, we're gon na be well on our way to victory come this Tuesday.'' `` It's been an exhilarating campaign,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` but it's time to come to an end and let the people make their decision. He told reporters he was pleased with his campaign role, which he saw as a `` lightning rod'' for attacks by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Actually, that's part of our strategy,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` We want them to attack the vice presidential candidate and to leave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alone. We want <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to go out and be able to speak to the people.'' `` He's running for president, and all the fire they want to direct at me _ we're delighted,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He ducked a question whether he was concerned about polls suggesting that voters have lingering doubts about his fitness for the vice presidency. `` The true test is, how does <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> do in the election,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied. `` That's the only test I'm interested in.''

<TEXT>
 The army's representative on the ruling four-man junta resigned Monday and his replacement was named, as part of changes wrought by President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the military branch that is the backbone of his power. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army's commander, accepted the resignation of Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> from the junta, said a statement issued by army headquarters. No reason was given for the resignation. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 61, served on the junta since December 1986. Hours later, another communique announced thar Gen. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, 58, an officer noted for his fervent personal loyalty to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, had been picked by the 72-year-old president to replace <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. The move apparently prompted the retirement of Gen. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, public works minister and a Pinochet loyalist, who had more seniority than <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>. Although leving the army, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> woul kept his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post, the government said. Until last week, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> had been the army's deputy commander-in-chief, the man who handles the day-to-day business in the service, as <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> devotes most of his time to the presidency. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> was replaced by Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Zincke </PERSON>, 54, considered less a hardliner than this predecessor. Last week, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> reshuffled the highest ranks of his army, sending 13 generals into retirement. He also promoted 10 brigadiers to the rank of general. The junta also includes the commanders-in-chief of the navy, air force and national police. It has served as a legislature in the absence of a congress, which was disbanded when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a bloody 1973 military coup that ousted the elected leftist government of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> last month lost a referendum in which citizens refused to extend his rule to 1997 and voted for a transition to democracy. Elections for a civilian congress and a successor to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> are scheduled for December 1989. Since the 1973 coup, the army's representative on the junta has changed four times. The <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>'s representative, Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, has been a junta member since the coup.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent his case to the voters Monday, leading in the polls as he pledged a `` steady hand'' to build on the accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned into overtime, vowing a `` November surprise'' that would land him in the White House. Some polls suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support might be eroding as both men raced across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in a final-day search for votes. Both campaigns spent nearly $ 1 million apiece on competing half-hour appeals on network television, and the vice president also aired a new five-minute commercial that sharply attacked his Democratic rival. `` It's in the hands of the gods and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' the vice president said before heading for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the final rally of his candidacy. `` I'm going to do my best to be a fine president and a good leader and somebody you can be proud of,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in the closing commercial of his campaign. `` No retreat baby, no surrender,'' said Democratic running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, echoing rock star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was on a 48-hour campaign blitz through 8,500 miles that would n't end until election morning in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He told a crowd of 20,000 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that Democrats would kick <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` right out of our future'' _ and then flew off into the night. Democrats expressed confidence they would command majorities in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that will govern alongside the new president. They also angled for modest gains in the dozen statehouse races on Tuesday's ballot. Both presidential campaigns relied on their 30-minute network commercials to reach the millions of voters that the pollsters said had n't yet chosen a candidate with certainty.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s blended snippets of biography, family tenderness and praise from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with a final taped appeal from the vice president. `` Americans are better off that they were eight years ago, and if you elect me president you will be better off four years from now than you are today,'' he said. He paid tribute to his rival, but said he was a man without experience in national security affairs. `` I can say that I believe I have the experience to be a steady hand guiding our country,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's commercial was a similar blend of speech-making and images from the campaign trail and bosom of his family. It showed him fielding questions on issues that have plagued him all campaign long, including his record on crime, the environment and his relunctance to respond to the negative attacks. He said in reply that he had a record of achievement on crime and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't. He criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a capital gains tax cut and said it would benefit the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. `` Now who is going to pay for that tax break. Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself, is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side?'' The final day of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest, costliest and _ some said _ nastiest presidential campaign left little room for subtlety. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared on stage in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with a caged quail _ an obvious dig at his Republican rival, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threw a stinging jab at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` We do n't want to return to my opponent's favorite song: ` For all you do, this recession is for you.''' Nor was there anything complicated about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' final day as a candidate _ an exercise in sleep deprivation that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed was `` brutal.''

<HEAD>Bush Does His Farewell `Thing'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> poked some kind and gentle fun at himself and the media traveling with him, giving them a recorded farewell message. In the message, played aboard the media jet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a string of his well-worn campaign slogans and the stump-speech lines reporters know by heart. The tape was played as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the press charter flew to his adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for election day from his final campaign stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` We've come a long way together,'' he said. `` We've solved the vision thing. You never use the ` W' word around me any more.'' He was referring to his tendency to use ` thing' as a catchall word and the ` wimp' label that dogged him early in the campaign. He said he he knew reporters had worked long and hard hours away from their homes and families to cover him. `` I've seen you rushing with the cameras and the mikes when I unexpectedly walk one way instead of another,'' he said. `` And I've seen all this and looked at you and thought: ` Tough, too bad, who cares It's your problem, get a raise. Get a real job, get a haircut.'

 Twenty-nine homeless people protesting a lack of housing were arrested across from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> on Monday when they tried to occupy a federal office building and an adjoining courthouse. Nearly 50 men and women, a few holding children, sought to enter the William Green Federal Building on the edge of Independence National Historic Park. Group members said they planned to sit-in at the ninth floor offices of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., and set up a temporary homeless shelter, but they were barred at the main entrance, and a scuffle ensued Two federal policemen were pushed to the ground but were not injured. Federal marshals and building police brought out 3-foot riot sticks and plexiglass shields and massed in front of the inside lobby. The equipment was never used. Protestors then circled the building, to the courthouse side, where only people with a government ID card or who could show they had business inside were allowed in. The protesters distributed leaflets that demanded the government restore $ 25 billion for housing programs that was cut from the federal budget. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON>, director of the federal security officers, said his plan was to keep the building open for business but to prevent any occupation _ and he ordered all but two doors left open so people could get in or out. The chants outside increased _ `` What do we want? Houses. When do we want them? Now'' _ and the demonstrators, some locking hands in a tight chain, began pushing and shoving, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> ordered all the doors locked inside. Outside the demonstrators chained the doors shut. Hundreds of federal workers, jurors and attorneys blocked from going to lunch crowded into the cafeteria on the second floor of the Green building. Others who got out had to use the basement garage entrance to get back in. That's when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayleson </PERSON>, on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, went to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> who issued `` under the urgent circumstances'' a temporary restraining order directing that those blocking the doors provide a path for people to get in and out. When the protestors refused to budge, federal marshals and local police moved in and carried 29 people to vans that took them to a federal detention center in the courthouse basement. All were later released on their own recognizance and ordered to appear for hearings. Last week, seven people were arrested at a sit-in at <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Monday began a pilot program to stem the spread of AIDS by providing drug addicts new hypodermic needles in exchange for their used ones. Only two men appeared at <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to get the needles although the program, which is aimed at reducing needle sharing among addicts, is intended to serve as many as 200 intravenous drug abusers. `` Today, we're going to have only a handful,'' said health commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. `` We're going to build slowly up'' over a period of weeks or months, he predicted. Under the $ 240,000 program, which has drawn heated opposition from conservatives and some minority group organizations, addicts also will receive counseling on AIDS and drugs. Another 200 addicts will receive only counseling; over time, their rate of infection will be compared with the infection rate of those receiving needles. The program is open only to addicts over age 18 who have applied for drug treatment and been denied immediate admission to the city's overcrowded programs Anyone wishing to apply Monday had to locate a small room down a first-floor corridor marked `` Employees Only.'' No sign announced the location of the room, and applicants had to ask for directions and pass several police officers to reach the program's office. Applicants would be asked to fill out a consent form, learn about the program and take a blood test. They would receive a kit including a condom, sterile water and pamphlets about safe sex and needle hygiene. An addict who tries to get a new needle without returning the old one will be expelled from the program, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. City officials say the program is believed to be the first of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, though similar programs have operated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> had backed a similar proposal, but it was rejected by the city council earlier this year; in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, plans for needle distribution were delayed by problems obtaining liability insurance. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s program `` is an attempt to find out whether an exchange can be helpful in slowing -LRB- AIDS -RRB- transmission among the addicts and to their sex partners and unborn children that is having a devastating effect on minority communities,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. But two prominent black city officials, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Special Narcotics Prosecutor <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, criticized the program, as did the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Black and Hispanic Caucus. `` When the first needle is given out by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, he ought to be indicted for murder. It's genocide, pure and simple,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> termed such criticism `` outrageous,'' adding: `` When you look at who this crisis is hitting hardest, it's the black community that's bearing the brunt. The lives that can be saved if this program works is the lives of black women and babies.'' Originally, the needles were supposed to be exchanged at other sites around the city. But when officials at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> school complained that the school was next door to one of those sites, the city announced that the program would be limited to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters for the moment. Of the nearly 17,000 AIDS cases reported in the city since 1981, about 4,500 are believed to have contracted the disease through intravenous drug abuse. More than half of the city's 200,000 drug addicts are believed to be infected with the AIDS virus, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. Meanwhile, in a speech to corporate executives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> endorsed the concept of a pilot needle exchange program, although he said later he was unfamiliar with the details of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> program. Of needle exchanges in general, he said Monday: `` Let's do it. ... This -LRB- AIDS epidemic -RRB- is a catastrophe waiting to happen.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made half-hour network appeals for votes Monday night, the final chapter in a long, often nasty television war that played a key campaign role. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the underdog, hit on traditional Democratic themes in a program featuring him on the stump, dancing with his wife, playing the trumpet and answering questions from voters at town meetings. Much of the program featured questions posed by people taped at locations all around the country, asking questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' seeming coldness during the campaign, his reluctance to respond to attacks and his positions on defense `` Maybe I do n't wear my heart on my sleeve, but my passion is in my service to the public,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, appearing in a red pullover sweater in a room filled with books. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of the half hour responding to issues raised by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, among them his crime record and his defense positions. If elected, he told one questioner, `` you can bet your life ... that this nation will be defended and defended well.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> film included sizable chunks of his nomination acceptance speech and clips from debates as well as a number of his campaign commercials, dropped virtually unedited into the middle of the program. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> children and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grandchildren all appeared in the program, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s media adviser, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, played a brief offscreen role as interviewer. But vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whom polls have shown to be a drag on the ticket, was nowhere to be found. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at one point that he respected his opponent. But the program included reiterations of his criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing the death penalty, school prayer and a law requiring teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance, and for supporting a liberal prisoner furlough program. In one of the only new segments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contended: `` My opponent has no experience in national security affairs. I do n't believe we can take a risk on an issue as important as our national security.'' In the final days before the election, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intensified his television drive in key medium-sized and small states while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added a slashing five-minute attack ad to his TV mix. The lengthy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercial is a reprise of his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on crime, the economy and the environment. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose program prominently featured vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, opened his network appeal with footage from an Oct. 26 town meeting in <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, Ill. In the course of the broadcast he addressed questions about family, jobs, senior citizens, hunger and farmers. He also attacked the Republicans' agricultural policy and charged that they would balance the budget by cutting Social Security. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touted his management of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy, saying he had inherited `` a financial and economic basket case'' that is now an economic success story. And he belittled what he called `` the only new idea <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had since this campaign began _ a new $ 40 billion, five-year capital gains tax giveaway for the very rich.'' `` Now who is going to pay for that tax break?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> demanded. `` Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself, is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side?'' It was left to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to complain about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hardball media strategy. `` The people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have been outraged by the distortions the Republicans have made with their commercial TV,'' he said. And he contended that voters are also `` deeply concerned'' about the choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not appear in his five-minute broadside against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Instead, state residents, officials and others were shown charging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was responsible for budget deficits, tax hikes, job losses, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> pollution and a prison furlough program. `` It's a broad overview of everything that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands for, according to his record,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad director <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said Monday. He said the ad was running in selected markets and denied it was introduced in response to narrowing poll margins. `` It was planned long ago,'' <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intensified his media drive over the final weekend in eight states where polls showed the race was tightening, as a hedge against potential losses in one or two large industrial states. The expanded buys were in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. All told, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running eight ads in spot markets in 30 states as his campaign ended, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON>. Most of them stressed his `` on your side'' slogan. Another attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record as head of a drug interdiction task force and his choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and there was also a spot that featured <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s famous `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' retort to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during their debate. Among the ads running for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in spot markets across the country and on various networks were a musical appeal and a spot saying he is the only candidate experienced enough to negotiate with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 A buoyant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended his presidential quest Monday night in his adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after declaring, `` It's in the hands of the gods and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Addressing 6,000 enthusistic supporters in a downtown shopping mall, the vice president said, `` Most Americans believe our best days are still ahead.'' With that line, borrowed from Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended a presidential campaign he formally begun in this city nearly 13 months ago. `` It's great to be back where it all began, right here in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who maintains a legal voting residence here in a hotel suite. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also addressed the nation in a 30-minute prime time commercial that combined footage from his convention acceptance speech of last August with parts of early commercials, clips of members of his family and a direct election-eve appeal to voters that was taped last week. In the ad, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> echoed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 1980 campaign line, saying, `` If you elect me president you will be better off four years from now than you are today.'' In that campaign, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had asked, `` Are you better off today than you were four years ago.'' The film may have been as notable for what it did not include as what it did, any mention of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sometimes controversial running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. On the way to the gala finale in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the Republican presidential nominee barnstormed three battleground states in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ which have a combined 54 electoral votes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told rallies in rural <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, that he felt momentum building in his favor. `` That adrenalin is flowing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a cheering crowd in the <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium. `` Our family's together. The country's coming in behind our candidacy, and I want to win this election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared with members of his family and campaign at the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> rally, where he could n't resist delivering several final vollies at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Do n't play recession roulette with the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' and said. But the line getting the biggest cheer was the oft-repeated campaign refrain which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` can be summed up in three short words: no new taxes.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, at his <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> campaign headquarters, he said, `` I feel good, but we're not going to let up until we finish tonight. ... It's in the hands of the gods and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' He told volunteers there that he hoped the harsh campaign talk of the past few months was over. `` Today is for looking over the horizon and into the future,'' he said. Earlier, standing before a huge American flag in a <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION> shopping mall, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said he was heading for the finish `` not in a power walk but in a sprint.'' It was a mocking reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favorite form of exercise, a fast-paced walk with weights in each hand. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> crossed paths during the last hours of their campaigns, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> insisted that the vice president was not stalking his opponent. `` Is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shadowing us?'' she asked. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was crucial to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election hopes and that he was seizing the opportunity for `` a final presence'' to boost his chances of carrying each state. She said the campaign's overnight tracking polls showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nationwide leading holding at eight to 10 percentage points and that no further slippage was detected `` He's in really good spirits'' and unconcerned by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' all-night campaign effort, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said `` He slept like a baby,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the candidate's wife, told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two. She reacted philosophically to the end of the campaign. `` What will be will be,'' she said, and expressed surprise at the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' non-stop final day of campaigning `` That's brutal,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> rally that `` what it all boils down to is that my opponent and I have a fundamentally different view of the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said, `` This is no time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to turn dramatically left.'' `` We do n't want to return to my opponent's favorite song: For all you do, this recession is for you, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The government announced Monday it would introduce a package of legislation to create a fifth TV channel and de-regulate the country's entire broadcasting network. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the government minister responsible for broadcasting, said the legislation to be put before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> next year would lead to a huge expansion of choice for viewers and listeners. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> now has two non-commercial channels run by the publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and two independent commercial channels. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the plans included a fifth channel, to start broadcasting in 1993, two new satellite stations and three independent national radio networks. Independent radio currently is confined to regional networks, and plans for three satellite stations already have been approved by the government. Because the franchises for the new channel would go to competitive tender, the plan has aroused concern that there would be less stringent quality control than now exists. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> would be expected to continue `` high quality'' programming in both television and its network of national and regional radio. Although TV watching is a top leisure activity among <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s population of 56 million, change in the country's viewing opportunities has come slowly Recent government figures show that 95 percent of the population watches some televison and the average is 25 hours a week. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for commercial television, showed only one in three British adults had ever heard of the advent of direct satellite to home TV broadcasting, and only one-third were interested in renting or buying the receiving equipment.

 An Iranian father and son were sentenced Monday to 14 months and 6 months in prison, respectively, for trying to smuggle high-tech missile parts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he imposed `` what might seem to some a relatively short sentence'' against 64-year-old <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, 30. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said mitigating factors included the elder <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>'s age and poor health, the younger <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>'s naivete and the father's belief that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was interested in improving relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> characterized the younger <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>, who appeared in court with his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife and 4-year-old daughter, as `` extremely naive, perhaps more accruately described as extremely stupid.'' Among the son's gaffes, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said, were suggesting a $ 60 million illegal deal over the telephone to an unknown <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> worker, not knowing what a TOW missile was and inquiring about Stinger missiles simply because he had heard them mentioned in a TV news report about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> to 14 months in prison, including 10 months he has already served. As an Iranian national, he could be deported after his release. <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> was sentenced to 189 days in jail, the amount of time he has already served. He will also be required to perform 500 hours of community service in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where he has been an unemployed architect. Federal prosecutors had suggested a 2-year sentence for both for violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Arms Export Control Act by attempting to buy microwave tubes for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system and sell them to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The father pleaded guilty during their trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court while the son was convicted Oct. 26 by a jury after a 19-day trial. The trial stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posed as an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>, the Lexington-based firm that makes the Hawk system. An undercover agent recorded conversations in which he pretended to agree to steal microwave amplification tubes from <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> and sell them for $ 280,000 to the Modarressis. The Iranians were arrested Jan. 15 in a suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> freight yard where they had come to inspect the so-called twystron and klystron tubes. The <PERSON> Modarressis </PERSON> said they planned to disguise the tubes as well-drilling equipment and ship them to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via a third country such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The tubes are a critical component of the radar system that allows the Hawk to blast jet aircraft out of the sky. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has prosecuted at least 46 cases of arms smuggling or attempted arms smuggling to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since 1981, when the country's 8-year war with neighboring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began. A truce in the war was announced Aug. 20. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has maintained its effort to obtain spare parts for its military hardware, the bulk of which was bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the American-backed <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> government before the 1979 Islamic revolution. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> case pointed out the dire need <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has for parts. Though the initial attempted deal was for $ 280,000, tapes revealed the Iranians discussed buying up to $ 60 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons, including Stinger missiles and spare parts for the F-4 and F-14 jets.

 A defendant in a Mafial trial tossed a homemade bomb in the courtroom Monday, and the explosion sent lawyers diving for cover but caused no injuries and only minor damage, news reports said. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, quoting prosecutor <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Saluzzo </PERSON>, said the bomb was made out of gunpowder hidden in a cigarette package. <PERSON> Saluzzo </PERSON> said defendant <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marano </PERSON>, 44, shouted a warning and then tossed the explosive in the direction of a cell occupied by a group of other defendants in the trial. The court was convened Monday morning to hear the deposition of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, a Mafia informer who has confessed to 20 murders and already has been sentenced to 22 years in prison. <PERSON> Marano </PERSON> was among 18 defendants who face charges of homicide in connection with a war between rival gangs for control of the drug market. The same court last Friday convicted 130 people, including two judges, of belonging to a Mafia group that committed crimes throughout <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The court sentenced 26 of them to life in prison for their roles in the gang, which is blamed for 61 killings, four abductions and hundreds of robberies. Seven relatives of informants in the trial were killed. The court on Monday immediately ordered an investigation into how the defendant obtained the explosives and made the bomb.

 A woman who admitted holding a gun to the head of a 2-year-old boy and threatening to kill him during a 1969 skyjacking was sentenced Monday to six months in jail and five years' probation. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, 39, in a tearful plea for leniency, expressed remorse for her role in the 1969 hijacking of a plane to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I realize I endangered the lives of innocent people and I frightened them,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area for about 10 years under the name <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, with her second husband, <PERSON> Mylo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, and five children. She was arrested in July after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> received an anonymous tip. She already has served all but 33 days of the six-month jail term. Mrs. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> pleaded guilty Aug. 17 to a charge of interfering with the crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet bound for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Jan. 2, 1969. She admitted helping her first husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, force the plane to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> by taking the boy hostage. The child, his mother and 146 others on board were freed unharmed when the plane landed in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. At her sentencing, Mrs. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> said that she understands the feelings of <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION>, the mother of the 2-year-old. `` Over the last twenty years, I have suffered greatly,'' <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> said. `` I've been forced to abandon my two children by my first marriage and I've been forced to live a double life with my husband and five children. `` I'm now an honest, hardworking woman.'' After <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishler </PERSON> pronounced the sentence, she thanked him. `` I think you earned it,'' the judge said. `` I hope you prove it.''

 Maoist guerrillas killed two policemen, a soldier and two children in attacks in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s Andean highlands, officials said Monday. Police said about 30 guerrillas of the Shining Path movement attacked a on a police post in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION> de Cajas on Sunday evening. The village is 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, an important trading center in the central Andes 135 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. A wedding was under way in the second floor of the building, which also serves as municipal headquarters, when the rebels attacked with explosives and automatic rifle fire. Two girls, ages 12 and 14, who were among the guests were killed during the attack and a woman was severely wounded, police said. Police defenders were unharmed during the attack and after 15 minutes of heavy shooting, the rebels escaped from town in a stolen truck, police said. Another group of insurgents shot and killed an off-duty soldier caught in a rebel roadblock Sunday night near <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, police said. Elsewhere in the highlands, another Shining Path column of 25 rebels attacked two rural police posts before dawn Sunday 55 miles northeast of Puno, a city on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titicaca </LOCATION> 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. A Puno official, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbiola </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that the rebels killed two policemen, wounded two more and burned one of the posts before withdrawing. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s jungle region, rebels of the pro-Cuba <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> bombed half a dozen governnment and private buildings Sunday night in <LOCATION> Pucallpa </LOCATION>, 350 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. The rebels hurled bombs at the offices of a state development corporation, the municipal headquarters, the water company, a school, a state agricultural agency and a large grocery store, causing damage to the buildings but no injuries, according to police. The Shining Path launched an insurgency against <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government eight years ago, and the death toll in the violence since then has surpassed 12,000. The Tupac Amaru group, a much smaller band, became active in 1984, concentrating on late-night bombings in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. A year ago it opened a front in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s northern jungle with about 100 armed rebels, but the army moved into the area and quickly broke up the column. Police said the attack in <LOCATION> Pucallpa </LOCATION> may indicate the group is trying to re-establish a base in the jungle.

 A weakened Typhoon Skip roared into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Tuesday after killing at least five people and forcing thousands from their homes but sparing the capital its full fury. The government weather service said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON>, the second typhoon to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in as many weeks, swept across <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island early Tuesday and at mid-morning was reported about 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Maximum winds weakened to about 93 mph as the storm swept across the central Visayas island chain, the weather service said. Skip trajectory kept it about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, saving the capital from the high winds and flooding brought by Typhoon Ruby two weeks ago. Reports of damage and casualties from Typhoon Skip were sketchy because of poor communications to the affected area. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said at least five people were killed Monday in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province. They included three confirmed dead in a landslide in <LOCATION> Pasacao </LOCATION> about 210 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said 23 people were reported buried in the mudslide but only three bodies had been recovered. Late Monday, a radio station in the Camarines Sur city of Naga put the death toll in <LOCATION> Pasacao </LOCATION> at 10, including six children. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said at least two other children died when a tornado triggered by <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> roared through another town in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>. Most of the damage was reported in the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> and in southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> in the country's `` typhoon belt.'' Skip came ashore early Monday on <LOCATION> Samar </LOCATION> island, 410 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, with winds up to 108 mph and moved across the islands of <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romblon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tablas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported nearly 400,000 people `` affected'' by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property were damaged or destroyed. It said most were on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which was without electricity because Skip's winds blew down power lines. Departmental spokeswoman <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> <PERSON> Padua </PERSON> estimated damage on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> alone at about $ 400,000. Government officials said about 24,000 people were affected on <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> island, mostly from flooding. The coast guard said waves created by the typhoon sank a freighter in a <LOCATION> Bohol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> port, but reported no casualties among the crew. Storm warnings were posted in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and the government ordered schools closed Tuesday. Most domestic flights from the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport were canceled Tuesday but <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said service would be restored by nightfall. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION> television service said the six American military installations, including <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay naval base, could expect winds up to 60 mph early Tuesday. Some <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> flights to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> left early to avoid the storm, it said. Heavy rains caused landslides on the <LOCATION> Mayon </LOCATION> volcano, 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bicol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Hundreds of families were isolated by the slides and about 2,600 were evacuated from the slopes of <LOCATION> Mayon </LOCATION>, the country's best-known volcano, the agency reported. A coast guard report said the 326-ton freighter Sea Runner sank in port on <LOCATION> Bohol </LOCATION> on Monday after a battering by strong winds and heavy waves. All 17 crewmen escaped but the cargo, 11,250 bags of cement, was reported lost. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said 14 of the 16 towns in <LOCATION> Capiz </LOCATION> province, 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, were flooded Monday and hundreds of families were being evacuated to schools and churches. More than 700 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of <LOCATION> Aklan </LOCATION> province, also on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION>, the office said. Typhoon Ruby struck the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, and tropical storm <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> swept through the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Saturday. Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least 64 others were killed and more than 200 are missing from the passenger ship <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, which sank 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> during the typhoon. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported at least eight people killed Saturday near <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, during flooding caused by <PERSON> Tess </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said three were killed by floods on <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Skip is the 20th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the archipelago in 1988.

 Former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> may have offered a job to a witness who was to testify against her, a prosecutor said Monday in a conference with the judge hearing the divorce-fixing case. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>, a former journalist who worked as a speechwriter for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> over a 15-year period, testified he heard from her last month for the first time since she fired him in 1983. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the former commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs; her companion, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43; and former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 75, are on trial on charges stemming from <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s divorce case. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, is accused of giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, to influence the judge's decision in the divorce case The judge's daughter was hired in August 1983 and Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> slashed <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary alimony and child support payments to his estranged wife less than a month later. Moments after <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>'s testimony Monday, the defense objected, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> excused the jury and held a private conference with prosecutors and defense attorneys. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> `` that she was thinking of starting a foundation and that she thought he would be a good person to head the foundation,'' according to a transcript released at the end of the day's hearing. `` Is there anything more?'' the judge asked. `` Is it that the inference is to be drawn that she was trying to buy him off by offering him something at a foundation?'' `` I think that is a fair inference,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> `` sort of made light of it ... he essentially sloughed it off.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>, said: `` I think it's an ambiguous conversation.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> agreed that the situation was ambiguous and that the testimony might be prejudicial to the other defendants. He ruled it could not be allowed as testimony. The lawyers and defendants are operating under a gag order and could not be asked for comment. However, <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Monday evening, discounted what prosecutors said. `` I explained it to those guys -LRB- federal prosecutors -RRB- there. It's a joke, a longstanding joke between us,'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said `` The only interpretation to it, I guess, was she was trying to have her sense of humor come out. That is something, when you are between a rock and a hard place, to have your sense of humor,'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said. `` Believe me, it's a non-story.'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> also testified that when he went to work for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> at Cultural Affairs, he did not have to go through a city interview process, his resume was not submitted for review and he did not have the stated qualifications for the job title he operated under. `` I was n't aware of titles,'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> testified. `` Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was familiar with my background and the work I had done,'' he added. `` I knew what I had been brought in to do and I did it.''

 A nightclub manager who confessed to the beating death of jazz musician <PERSON> Jaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON> pleaded guilty Monday to a reduced manslaughter charge that can bring a maximum of 21 months in prison. Prosecutors said they reached the agreement with <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Havan </PERSON>, 26, after conflicting evidence weakened the first-degree murder case, which could have brought life imprisonment. <PERSON> Havan </PERSON>, a Vietnamese immigrant, is scheduled for sentencing in <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 5 and could also receive five years probation. <PERSON> Havan </PERSON> contended he pushed <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON>, 35, as he tried to enter the club in an intoxicated state. But a medical examiner's report indicated <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON> suffered massive head injuries before falling into a coma. <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON> died nine days after the Sept. 11, 1987, incident at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> club. <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, was one of the nation's pre-eminent bass players in the late 1970s, when he toured with Blood, Sweat and Tears, <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Weather Report He was nominated for three Grammy Awards. <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON> over the past five years gradually fell into alcohol and drug abuse and was homeless at the time of his death.

Dropping all pretense of avoiding any predictions about the possible election of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a toast as <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One sped back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's been a privilege to work for you the past eight years and in this campaign.

Because it was the last leg of the final campaign trip of his presidency, the president's aides also presented him with a large, white cake, decorated in red and blue with the words: `` Win One for the Gipper. Victory 88, We are the change,'' all well-used <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign slogans. The staff then gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an album of <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> songs, which included the selection, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Row </PERSON> the Boat Ashore,'' one of the quips <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has regularly included in his stump speech in order to poke fun at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense policies. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reported that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not only joined in eating a bit of the cake, but had a glass of champagne to celebrate his trip. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> later said, `` is feeling really upbeat ...

 Partisans of 29 statewide propositions Californians face Tuesday spent a record $ 130 million _ more than $ 9 a voter _ on a media war involving issues like car insurance rates, AIDS and raising cigarette taxes. More than half the spending has centered on five conflicting propositions aimed at revamping the auto insurance rate-setting process and lowering premiums. Insurance companies alone, fearing a budding `` car premium revolt,'' poured more than $ 60 million into the battle, and trial lawyers' groups spent $ 15 million, making it the most expensive single campaign in the country outside a presidential race.

 The government amnesty program for illegal immigrants entered its second phase Monday, but turnout was light on the first day those who took advantage of the program could begin applying for permanent residency. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials expect about 1.5 million of the 1.8 million non-agricultural amnesty applicants to apply for permanent residency.

Permanent resident status brings a person a so-called green card _ they've actually been white since 1976 _ which allows them to leave and enter the country at will and to eventually apply for citizenship. Amnesty recipients who apply for permanent residency must either take a 60-hour English and civics class from an INS-certified school or pass an oral and written test similar to the citizenship test given to permanent residents who enter this country legally.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is facing new political challenges that are testing President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s power in the region. Long-time rival <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is challenging <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, his own backyard, and more broadly in the Arab world. Moderate Arab leaders like President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are lining up to curb <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> At the same time, the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-held territories has bolstered another rival, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and likely weakened <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, however, has proven himself a strong and agile leader since he came to power in a 1970 coup. He has suffered setbacks before, and managed to come out ahead. The ideological feud between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, one of the most bitter inter-Arab vendettas, has been rekindled by the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> had been Persian <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally against a fellow <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>. Other Arabs bitterly criticized <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> for siding with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, even though he argued that the alliance gave <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> leverage that helped keep the conflict from spreading, a claim most Arabs question. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military collapse, which forced it to accept the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> cease-fire, has enhanced the military and political prestige of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who sees himself as having saved the Arab world from <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic revolution. Secular <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Islamic-fundamentalist <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have little in common, except a hatred of <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are ruled by rival wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> got <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> together last year, but the reconciliation effort was short-lived. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media daily savages <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> as a `` traitor to the Arab nation'' and `` the slave of the imposters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s equally controlled press hurls the insults right back. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, its unruly western neighbor, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s interests now seem to be particularly at risk. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which considers itself the main power broker there, has failed to control the Lebanese Christians and get a pro-Syrian president elected to succeed <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose 6-year term expired Sept. 23. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, stepped down without a successor elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> because of a boycott by the Christians, who opposed pro-Syrian candidates, the only serious contenders. The Lebanese government now has split in two, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been arming the Christians' main militia, the Lebanese Forces. The crisis has deepened the partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, split into <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem cantons during the 13-year-old civil war, and made the prospects of a Syrian-sponsored settlement, a cornerstone of <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s foreign policy, even more distant. It has also undercut the Syrian claim to be the sole Arab arbiter in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which other countries have never really disputed until now. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, another foe of <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s because of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, recently formed a new alliance and called for an emergency Arab summit on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, noting that a Pan-Arab effort was needed to save <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, stressed that `` there is no time for indulgence in courtesies toward <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or other countries.'' Elsewhere in the region, the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has eclipsed <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s efforts to wrench control of the Palestinian cause from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> The uprising has dramatically shifted the focus of the Palestinian cause from the refugee camps in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s proxies fought for years to crush <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s forces, to the occupied territories where <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> is powerless to intervene <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s men were forced out of camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by Syrian-backed Palestinian dissidents, heavily reinforced by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers disguised as guerrillas. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> still has strongholds in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and, allied with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, his strength has been bolstered by the uprising. This has robbed <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of any chance of being able to deliver the Palestinian card in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement, dimming the prospects of regaining the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1967. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is expected shortly to win approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament in exile, to declare a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with a provisional government.

<HEAD>Young Portuguese Farmers Turning Away from Traditional Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORRES NOVAS, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young Portuguese farmers are looking for more stable incomes by switching from traditional grains such as wheat and corn to more exotic crops like pistachio nuts, almonds, papayas and truffles. Among the hundreds of visitors in October to the Third National Dry Fruits Fair in this rural town 73 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, those most interested in new crops seemed to be young farmers. One such couple _ 38-year-old former airline steward <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> and his American wife, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, 25 _ said they are switching from wheat to pistachios, almonds, walnuts, papaya and truffles on the 207-acre farm he inherited from his parents in the <LOCATION> Alentejo </LOCATION> region north of the <LOCATION> Tagus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The couple said the farm lost more than $ 26,000 last year on wheat. `` We've both traveled widely and wherever we went pistachios were so expensive, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> decided it was time to try grow them himself,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> native. <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> said he hopes to tap the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> market, which <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said imported 61,480 tons of almonds and 38,557 tons of pistachios last year. The institute's data also shows that <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s exports of almonds to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been steadily increasing, reaching 14,000 tons in 1986 and 18,100 tons in 1987. But converting his father's crops to more profitable nuts and fruit is not going to be cheap. <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> said he has already spent $ 35,000 to import irrigation equipment from neighboring <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Carvalhos </ORGANIZATION>, as young farmers in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s poorest nation, are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> aid to help them pay for new projects. Other farmers are not so fortunate. About two-thirds of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s estimated 970,000 farmers, who make up about one-fifth of the country's working population but contribute only about 9 percent to the country's gross domestic product, are over 55 years old and thus do not qualify for such assistance projects. Many of the tiny working farms in isolated rural areas also have the added burden of illiteracy and are less motivated to innovate. Their productivity lags way behind the West European average, and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has to import more than half of what it's population of 10 million eats. `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has to select the most appropriate products it can grow for current market demands,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>, a service director at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. This means the production of grains -LRB- wheat, corn, rye, barley and oats -RRB- has to be cut back and more oranges, lemons and grapefruit planted. Although citrus crops compete directly with those of other <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> countries, they still find a market in the colder northern European countries. Other new hopefuls are strawberries and melons. Small-scale production of avocados by farmers in the southern Algarve region increased from 353 tons in 1980 to more than 870 tons in 1986, according to the foreign trade institute. `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s climate is such that it can grow practically anything exotic,'' said <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON>, whose decision to cultivate truffles was prompted by a look at market prices abroad. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s famous specialist grocers, <ORGANIZATION> Fortnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, sells 50 grams -LRB- 1.6 ounces -RRB- of imported white Italian truffles for the equivalent of $ 83 _ or about $ 725 a pound. French truffles at <ORGANIZATION> Fortnum </ORGANIZATION>'s run more than $ 900 a pound.

<HEAD>Church Works Behind Scenes for Change in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While it condemns activism by clergymen, the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the most influential in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, works behind the scenes in trying to persuade the government to change its apartheid policies. The quiet diplomacy usually is undertaken on a personal level: President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and 90 percent of his all-white Cabinet, plus most of the white-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Two years ago, the church, known by its Afrikaans initials as the <ORGANIZATION> NGK </ORGANIZATION>, adopted a document called `` Church and <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.'' It declared apartheid a mistake, termed racism a sin and said the church could no longer dictate specific political policies. Fifty ministers and 30,000 people left the 953,000-member church to form a new right-wing church. Within the main church, which represents about 38 percent of the 5 million-white population, a conservative league was formed to try to repeal `` Church and Society.'' The document said the church had been wrong to spend decades giving biblical justification to apartheid and advocating certain discriminatory laws, such as a ban on mixed marriage. Its new view, the church said, was that the Bible can not be used to support any political model, either apartheid or integration. Moderator <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON>, elected to head the church during the 1986 synod that adopted `` Church and Society,'' said: `` That did not imply we have nothing to say to government. The Bible explicitly tells us there are certain major, universal, applicable, ethical norms which are of paramount importance for political policy.'' `` Church and Society'' urges the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government to uphold Scriptural norms, calls the withholding of political rights an affront to human dignity and asks authorities `` to give ongoing and sympathetic attention'' to regulations people find offensive. Some critics argue the church still gets involved in politics but that its involvement is tolerated because it is regarded as `` the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at prayer.'' As an example, critics cite the church leaders' recent urging of congregations to sign petitions opposing international sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Some individuals in English-speaking churches see in the <ORGANIZATION> NGK </ORGANIZATION> a government-supporting church,'' said <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON>. `` That worries me. We do not support the government, but we have so many members in government we are responsible to them spiritually.'' The church is in the position of seeking to represent the interests of its flock, mainly white Afrikaners, while it is officially open to all races. It calls for speedier change of policies it once said were biblically justified and tries not to be seen as engaging in politics in a country where, <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON> says, `` everything is seen from a political view.'' In July, the church magazine, <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkbode </PERSON>, questioned the morality of indefinitely stationing South African troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where Cuban troops support a Marxist government. Two months later, the South African troops withdrew. A few weeks after church leaders said they had spoken to Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> about detentions without trial, particularly of children, <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> announced that all detainees under 16 had been released. The large majority of those detained are blacks. The church said that since the government has made it legal for people of different races to marry, it now is wrong not to allow them to live together where they choose. In October, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s white chamber passed a bill that would allow the country's first legal, multiracial residential areas Recently, <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON> has spoken to President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> about <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader, and about the fate of the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, a group of blacks sentenced to hang for participation in the mob killing of a black town councillor. <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON> would not disclose details of the discussions. `` We are active in these sort of deliberations,'' but can not claim credit for the government's decisions, he said. `` The church and state are completely independent.'' He and other Dutch Reformed Church leaders disagree strongly with what they call the `` political activism'' of <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the black Anglican archbishop who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, and the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, head of the mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. The alliance disassociated itself with the <ORGANIZATION> NGK </ORGANIZATION> over apartheid, and <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> opposes reconciliation until the white church uses its influence more emphatically to end apartheid and bring about a one-person, one-vote political system. The <ORGANIZATION> NGK </ORGANIZATION> says its members should obey the authorities and supports the government in maintaining law and order. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> maintains that the government is illegitimate, on both theological and political grounds, and favors a church-led campaign of civil disobedience. <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON> said: `` We personally think that the moment they -LRB- activist clergymen -RRB- are going to prescribe to government what structure should be created, they deviate from a pure, church and biblical view.

 An American tropical insect expert faces a possible prison term in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for backing native Indians trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood their tribal lands in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, 41, a native of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who holds a Ph.D. from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, has been charged by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal police under a law that prohibits foreigners from `` getting involved in internal <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> affairs'' and `` denigrating the country's image. The maximum penalty is three years in prison, followed by expulsion. Authorities also have forbidden the stocky, bearded, soft-spoken naturalist from entering certain areas inhabited by native tribes with which he has worked since 1977. And, under the threat of dismissal from his Brazilian government job as a professor-level researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> is barred from leaving <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle is being destroyed at an a alarming rate,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> recently told a group of foreign correspondents in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. `` Meanwhile, native Indians have lived in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> for 20,000 years in perfect coexistence with the environment. I'm trying to call serious attention to the native philosophy for preserving ecology. `` How can that be considered subversive?'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> traditionally has eyed the vast hydroelectric potential of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> as a way to expand its already sophisticated industrial base, situated mostly in the southern part of the country. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> irked Brazilian authorities when earlier this year he took two chiefs of the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> tribe to a seminar at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> where they spoke against reported government hydroelectric projects in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where they repeated their views to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which frequently helps finance such projects. `` It was the first time outsiders got to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' side of the Amazon development story,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said. Chiefs Kube-i and <PERSON> Paulinho </PERSON> <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON>, wearing native headdresses and collars and jungle body paint, addressed their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hosts in Portuguese, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s official language, and <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> translated In an inexplicable move, the government also indicted the Indians, who were born in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and never had been out of the country before, for violating the Foreigners Law. `` The charges against the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have no legal basis. We'll get the accusations thrown out,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a lawyer in the Amazon-delta city of <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> is based. `` The real purpose is to intimidate Professor <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> and make him shut up.'' `` This is purely political,'' added <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who along with Kube-i and <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON>, also met with foreign reporters. `` We tried to get information about dams from our own government,'' said <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON>. `` But they would n't tell us anything. They treated us like children. So we went to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, and it turned out they did n't know much about these projects. Now they do.'' Federal power officials deny claims by radical environmentalists that they have a `` secret plan'' to build 26 hydroelectric dams along <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tributaries where Indians from 11 tribes, including the 8,500-member Kaiapos, live, fish and hunt in relatively untouched primitive conditions. Of the estimated 5 million Indians here when <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> explorers discovered <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1500, only around 250,000 remain, in an over-all population of 144 million. Anthropologists have expressed fears about the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' continued survival, as hundreds of thousands of non-Indian homesteaders, ranchers and prospectors stream into the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> annually, chopping and burning away the rainforest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas. `` There have been a lot of gossip and rumors about hydroelectric plans in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Diomedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the spokesman for a government Amazonian power company called Eletronorte -LRB- cq Eletronorte -RRB-, said in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital. `` We have looked into only six potential dam sites, and we're talking about projects that would n't be carried out until well into the 21st century.'' `` The government will do everything possible to protect the environment and the Indians,'' <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. Meanwhile _ and without saying whether the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' sudden high profile had anything to do with it _ the government says it has shelved plans for a proposed dam known as <LOCATION> Babaquara </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a major <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tributary that passes through the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> lands. Its reservoir would have covered 2,300 square miles, twice the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> had intended to ask the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to finance it. Now, says <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, the only <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> dam under possible consideration is one called <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION>, with a reservoir one-fifth the size of that of <LOCATION> Babaquara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said construction of the 11 million-kilowatt <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION> installation _ nearly twice as large as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Grand Coulee Dam, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' biggest _ could not begin until 1991 or 1992. <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said, `` So far we're talking only about hydroelectric potential feasibility studies. We're not saying <PERSON> Kararao </PERSON> will be built. But even if it is, there would n't be another dam in that region before 2010.'' Nonetheless, a Kayapo Legal Fund, partially coordinated by <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, has been set up at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, to keep an eye on the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> dam situation. The Kayapos plan to call a multitribal meeting of up to 5,000 Indians in late January to discuss the overall problem of <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> development projects. `` The Indians are serious,'' said <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>. `` The problem is that hardly anyone takes them seriously _ and they have so much to teach us.''

<HEAD>Television's Political Coverage This Election's Loser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sometimes network news simply informs. Sometimes it actually enlightens. Sometimes, as in the case of the 1988 presidential election, it does neither. When whales bobbing amid <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> ice floes become as big a television story as the contest for the next leader of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, something is wrong. From the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus media spree to the manufactured `` What does <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> want?'' stories of the Democratic convention to November's addiction to opinion polls, television's flashy political coverage has had the weight of melba toast The collapse of thoughtful reporting comes at a crucial time _ more than half of all Americans now say they depend on television news as their single source of information. It's no shock, then, that this year's presidential turnout may be the lowest since <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>'s election in the 1920s. Does anyone want to elect a soundbite? The candidates have been reduced on television to mumblers of mostly meaningless charges and counter-charges. We may want policy statements, but we get photo opportunities. Where do the nominees really stand on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy? The deficit? Welfare reform? With occasional exceptions, the networks do n't seem to know or care. Television, of course, has no legal obligation to present thorough work. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, if he wanted, could read aloud from the National Enquirer for 22 minutes every weeknight. It's understood, though, that in exchange for free broadcast licenses, television will aim every so often for public service. Not this time around. Television tends to do best when it watches and does n't create _ that's why a space shuttle launch is usually more riveting than the latest `` ALF'' episode. At its most useful, television takes our eyes and ears where they otherwise could not go. But in looking at this year's campaign, television's cameras have blinked rather than stared, thereby helping define the simplistic terms under which the campaign was to be conducted. The resulting flood of video mishmash _ long on symbols and personalities and short on substance _ has to a degree even influenced coverage by print journalists. `` Perhaps because there was not much else to talk about, analysis of this campaign is already beginning to hone in on television's role,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oreskes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote recently. Not much else to talk about? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sit at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Surely, there's more than one story in that. Television, though, does n't seem to notice. Its horse-race fascination, to be sure, is nothing new. But in 1988, it has taken on new dimensions. A week and a half before the election, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> was still asking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> why he did n't perform better in the second presidential debate. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Sunday newscast _ two days before the election _ led with an assessment that 439 electoral votes are firmly in or leaning toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can count 30. Is this a public service? ABC News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> blames the political parties for fixing the process to such an extent that it's become a bore to the public and therefore to the news media. `` It's very hard to to cover substance when there's no substance there,'' he told reporters recently. `` And I think more and more things are packaged for television. And it is not us who are doing the packaging, and it's not us who wanted to be packaged that way.'' But why are the campaigns `` packaging'' their message? Because they know it's the packaged soundbite that will get on the air. It's much easier _ and probably more fun _ to produce an elaborate graphic on the latest poll than analyze arcane issues. That decision, however, has an impact beyond the basic information presented. Not only does it discourage intellectual engagement in the political process, but it also appears to have favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' message is arguably more difficult to grasp. According to the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, television's campaign coverage down the homestretch was more partial to the Republican ticket. The center's study of 474 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS election stories found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surpassed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in `` good press'' by a 56 percent to 22 percent margin. Furthermore, nearly one story in four featured poll results, usually favorable toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the organization reported. `` Despite all the attention to his negative ads, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s domination of the network newscasts was the real catalyst to his comeback,'' said the organization's <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said not long ago that `` the unwanting-to-know'' public is responsible for `` reducing the state of political art in the country.'' That's an easy out. Chances are if television had really delved into the issues, viewers would stay tuned. The game-show fans already have `` Wheel of Fortune.''

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Economic Growth Quickened In October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Continued growth in production and orders helped the economy accelerate in October after slowing the previous month, according to the nation's purchasing managers. The Purchasing Managers Index rose to 56.8 in October from 54.8 in September, remaining below the year's peak of 59.3 in June, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Monday. An index above 50 percent generally indicates the economy is expanding. In addition to the growth in production, new orders grew at a slightly faster pace than in September, while new export orders rose again and employment rose sharply, the group reported. `` Despite the apparent slowing in the growth rate of new export orders, the continued high level of new orders, coupled with a reduced inflation rate, suggests the fourth quarter economy will be as good as the previous three,'' stated <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, chairman of the organization's Business Survey Committee. A number of economists closely watch the purchasing managers' report because it gives solid clues to the direction of the economy Production rose in October for the 27th consecutive month. The index for production rose to 60.3, up sharply from September's 56.0, which marked a slowdown from the 58.2 reading in August. The index for new orders rose to 58.9 from September's 58.4, narrowly reversing a three-month string of declining growth rates but trailing the 62.1 level of July. New export orders, a major element of recent economic growth, grew in October but the pace slowed for the third straight month. Among respondents who export, 26 percent reported higher export orders, down slightly from 27 percent in September and sharply lower than the 37.8 percent average for the first seven months of 1988. The proportion reporting lower export orders rose to 8 percent, the highest percentage this year and up from 6 percent in September. Employment rose sharply during the month, considering normal seasonal variations, with the index jumping to a new 1988 high of 53.7 from September's 50.2 and reversing two consecutive months of slowing growth. The employment index echoes the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October, matching a 14-year low as employers added 325,000 new jobs. Deliveries from vendors slowed for the 25th straight month _ an indication that suppliers ca n't keep up with strong demand _ although a rise in the index to 55.6 from 55.0 in September continues signaling that the rate of slowing is declining. Inventories declined slightly during October, after accounting for normal seasonal variations, with the index dropping to 49.4 from 49.6. Prices rose during October, with more purchasers reporting price increases than decreases for the 27th straight month. The index dipped to 70.7 from 72.2 in September, however, indicating that the rate of price increase slowed for the fourth straight month. The report is based on surveys of purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies in 21 industries in all 50 states. The organization has nearly 30,000 members.

Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Traders in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said the dollar would remain fairly stationary until the first indications of the result of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election Tuesday.

 Share prices declined across the board today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while the dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 180.39 points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 27,866.36. The dollar opened at 125.28 yen, and ranged between 124.95 and 125.33 yen before closing at 125.07 yen. That was up 0.44 yen from Friday's close of 124.63 yen. Securities dealers attributed the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s decline to profit-taking following bullishness last week and the worsening condition of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The Nikkei index gained 85.74 points last week, surpassing the 28,000-mark for the first time in three months. The news that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition worsened Sunday apparently discouraged bullish sentiment of the market. `` The emperor's condition is once again making investors nervous,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Many investors were profit-taking today because they thought the bullishness of the market will not last long because of the emperor's worsening illness.'' The world's longest-reigning monarch has been gravely ill since Sept. 19. On the foreign exchange market, exchange dealers said general market sentiment showed the dollar is still bearish, but added many players were remaining on the sidelines because of Tuesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election.

 Saudi Arabian oil production reached 6.4 million barrels a day during October, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday.

The Saudi Arabian production quota, set by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> o </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, is 4.3 million barrels a day.

Overproduction has driven the price of oil in world markets down by one third or more from the OPEC-set benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel.

 The stock market opened lower in quiet, early trading today, as Wall Street awaited the presidential election and continued to focus on last week's unexpectedly strong unemployment figures. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 15.47 points at 2,130.33 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST. Declining issues outpaced advancing ones by about 3 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 578 issues down, 186 up and 412 unchanged.

 <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>, a low-profile newspaperman who helped establish the world's largest family-owned communications empire, died of a heart attack. He was 82. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> died Sunday in his home. The family's holdings, now run by his nephews, include 26 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers, <LOCATION> Conde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nast </LOCATION> magazines, major book publishers and cable TV systems. Like his brothers, the late <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>, he shunned the limelight and was little known outside the newspaper business. `` We never went in for titles,'' he said in a 1985 interview. `` We are, basically, anonymous people. If I were to walk into a room in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> with the 100 most prominent people in town, there may be two who would know me personally. Most would probably know the name and the connection, but they would n't know me personally or recognize me by my face because my public position is non-existent.'' For the past 20 years, <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> was based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, although much of his time was spent traveling to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to visit <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> newspapers there. He did not take a role in the day-to-day operations of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> group's paper in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> kept a low profile in keeping with the philosophy he and his brothers adhered to. That philosophy continued as other generations of the <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> family moved into top management. Besides the newspapers, the family holdings _ now run by S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>'s two sons, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> _ include <ORGANIZATION> Vogue </ORGANIZATION>, Gourmet, Vanity Fair, HG, <ORGANIZATION> GQ </ORGANIZATION> and the New Yorker magazines, the Parade Sunday newspaper supplement, the <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> book publishing group and cable TV systems serving a million homes. Before moving to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1967, <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> was editor of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and, before that, the <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- Advance. He started selling The <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times when he was 5. The price was a penny a copy, and he was allowed to keep half, plus tips. S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> recalled that his brother quickly realized he could sell more if he just held one paper and said, pleadingly, `` Mister, please buy my last paper.'' As soon as he sold it, the fledgling entrepreneur would run off to get another from a nearby stack. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and worked summers in the classified and advertising departments at the Advance, which S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> had bought in 1922. After graduation, he became a reporter, and later city editor and managing editor. In 1937, when S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> bought The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Press, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> went there as editor, his last title in the newspaper business. The Newhouse group had no formal management structure. The Newhouse brothers simply met to discuss plans and problems, and if a dispute arose, everyone deferred to S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> because he was the eldest. `` We were his younger brothers,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said. `` That was all.'' Besides the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> operation, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> was responsible for The Plain Dealer in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, The <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -RRB- News, The Mobile -LRB- <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -RRB- Press, The Mobile Register, The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> and The <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times and News. In 1971, doctors diagnosed <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> with leukemia and told him he had five years to live. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said he never considered retirement because nobody in his family ever did. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>; his children; a sister and six grandchildren.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs rose by 19 this week to total 942, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The increase continues a seesaw trend, following a previous week decline of 10 working rigs and an increase of eight two weeks ago. A year ago, the count was 1,141, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> saw the largest increase with nine followed by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, four; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, three; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, one.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in volatile early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. All the markets opened lower, but then soybeans moved sharply lower while wheat turned higher. `` It's a bloodbath here this morning'' in the soybean pit, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Soybeans for delivery in November fell 10 cents a bushel in the first half-hour of trading. `` The market opened weaker than expected, then sold off sharply,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` There's just a bearish mentality that started after the bulls were unable to rally the market.''

The report cited the strong value of the yen and Swiss franc against the dollar as the main factors contributing to the high figures.

 Stock prices declined sharply in light to moderate trading today, as concern about Tuesday's presidential election and what could come afterward dominated the market. The market opened lower and continued to decline as skittish investors withdrew from buying and selling in anticipation of Tuesday's outcome. `` We're not seeing a lot of selling but just a lot of people not buying,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

But while the presidential election appeared to be the dominating force in today's market, some observers said the market's weakness suggested that many investors were already looking beyond the election and to wat could come afterward. Late last week, the stock market lost ground as new economic data indicating the economy might be growing faster than expected revived fears of higher inflation and interest rates. Some analysts had predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would wait until after the election to put the skids on inflation by raising interest rates. `` What is happening today is an extension of the anxieties that hit the market last week,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Weaker bond prices and lower transport stock prices also weighed heavily on today's stock market, analysts said. `` The bond market is leading our market ...,'' <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> said. `` I would be worried if I saw a bigger trading volume, but it's very slow ...''

 A landslide victory for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is already in the bank, so to speak. In a gimmick to attract deposit dollars, a handful of banks and thrifts nationwide have offered investors bonus interest rates on certificates of deposits based on the outcome of Tuesday's presidential election And if that money talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins. At the <ORGANIZATION> Regency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, customers with a minimum of $ 2,000 to invest had three months to put their money in either a one-year CD for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his Democratic challenger, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Holders of the winning `` Presidential Election CD'' would receive an extra 0.5 percent interest, which would mean a jump to 7.75 percent from 7.25 percent when the CD was first offered. Marketing assistant <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that as of Saturday, the purchasing cutoff date, a whopping 93.75 percent of all $ 3 million in sales were for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> CDs, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> getting the rest. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has always been ahead, but it seems to me it's gone up quite a bit over the last couple of weeks,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Not too surprisng for <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, an affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb that is heavily Republican. In the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, <ORGANIZATION> Perpetual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had similar results for its `` Presidential Certificate of Deposits.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, senior vice president of investor relations, said that as of the Saturday cutoff, 63 percent of the thrift's approximately $ 3 million in sales of two - and four-year CDs were <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said the margin was a lot narrower when the CDs were first offered in September and widened in recent weeks. At Perpetual, depositors of both persuasions are eligible for a bonus regardless of who wins the election. The thrift will award bonus interest to all depositors, up to a maximum of 0.5 percent, based on the winner's margin of victory in the popular vote. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heady </PERSON>, publisher of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, newsletter Bank Rate Monitor, said these special CD sales have broken some new ground. `` Politics has replaced the toaster as the hottest bank premium of the fall of 1988,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Last week's computer virus attack, the biggest ever, has caught the attention of leaders in business and government and should lead to improvements in computer security, several consultants said Monday. But the top officials, who ordinarily relegate security matters to lower-level employees, may be disturbed to find how expensive and inconvenient it can be to make their computers less vulnerable to a virus attack. `` I'm not sure there's a willingness to pay the check to do all the things that would have to be done to really close down all the loopholes,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, senior manager for information protection services at the accounting and consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells. Security consultants said they had received far more inquiries than usual since the end of last week. But they said computer security is a wide-ranging matter that can not be solved simply by assigning passwords and installing some anti-viral software. The attachment of computers into far-flung networks, a pervasive trend of the 1980s, has made each individual computer far more vulnerable to penetration from an outsider. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a computer security consultant in <LOCATION> Tappan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate the challenge. `` The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, ` Why do n't you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves from viruses?' he said. Several consultants said last week's virus attack, which infected 6,000 computers in the Arpanet research network, heightened the consciousness of senior managers in a way that smaller previous attacks had not. The virus clogged computers at universities and research institutes by spreading from one computer to another by electronic mail and making repeated copies of itself. It did not damage any data and was eventually erased. `` The real culprit -LRB- in lax security -RRB- is management. Management has finally become aware of what can happen to them,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Prugh </PERSON>, executive vice president for science and technology at <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in Silver Spring, Md. <PERSON> Prugh </PERSON> said computer security had probably been on a steady downtrend since the 1950s, when each computer was isolated in a locked room and only a handful of people were able or permitted to use it. <PERSON> Prugh </PERSON> said the downward trend in security probably reversed earlier this year, when awareness of the vulnerability of networked computers began to grow. But <PERSON> Prugh </PERSON>, and others, said there is a long way to go. `` This was all very predictable well in advance. The problem stems not from fantastic genius but from fantastic stupidity,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he expected boards of directors to take note of the security threats. But he said there were also signs of emerging complacency in some quarters. `` The reaction already is that this is an isolated instance, this is a boy genius, you ca n't prevent this, and besides, no harm was done,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` The only reason all the world's computers have n't crashed at the same time is because they are n't yet networked together,'' <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Faurer </PERSON>, president of the Corporation for <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent speech. He said he intended the remark as a joke with a message. `` We've got some pretty powerful tools. -LRB- But -RRB- we're not using those tools,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON>, a specialist in computer security at <ORGANIZATION> Fairleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The problem is that most kinds of security make things more time-consuming and inconvenient for computer users, and the users' job evaluations are based on how productive they are, <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON> said `` When you try to implement any kind of control procedure, you are immediately confronted by those people who say, ` Hey, I've got a job to get done. You're slowing the system down. You're getting in the way.''

Nine percent of the respondents said they had lost $ 50,000 to $ 1 million because of systems failures or downtime in the previous year, while another 2 percent said their losses exceeded $ 1 million. Those losses were unrelated to security breaches.

<HEAD>TWA President Resigns Post; New Structure Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that its president has resigned and the company is restructuring its top management. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which was privatized on Oct. 24, said President <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> is resigning effective Nov. 30. <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> wo n't be directly replaced as president, the airline said. A new three-man `` office of the chairman'' will be created to combine both executive and operational functions. The new office will consist of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s current chairman and owner, financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>; <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors; and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, senior vice president for ground operations at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. Under the new setup, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> will continue as chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> will still be called a director and <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> will become executive vice president. About 15 vice presidents will report directly to the three-man team. `` This structure will do away with unnecessary layers of management, and will give much more autonomy and responsibility to the vice presidents in the field,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> will remain on the boards of both <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a railcar leasing company owned by <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. His future plans include the purchase of a company, as yet unnamed, in which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> expects to invest, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> was recently mentioned in published reports as one of the parties interested in buying troubled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently sold <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle service to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million in cash. Last month, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> broke off efforts to acquire the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, after failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the airline's militant unions. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said Monday that while he is happy with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s financial turnaround since he took over the company, it still faces many challenges in the future. `` There was no question <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> must grow to thrive, and ... by far the most preferable way for the airline to grow is through acquisitions,'' he said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also said that, unless <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> makes an acquisition of `` major importance'' _ and possibly even if it does _ the airline will order 30 to 60 new narrow-body planes in the next three to six months. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON>, the airline's general counsel, said recently that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plans to lease or buy about 60 new aircraft to upgrade its aging fleet, at a cost of up to $ 1.5 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Fall Sharply On Rise In London Inventory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices fell sharply Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reported an increase in its warehouse stocks of copper for the first time in two months. It was the third price decline in as many sessions but analysts were divided on the significance of the buildup in copper stocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. On other markets, precious metals gained; grains were mostly higher while soybeans finished lower; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures rose and stock-index futures retreated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copper futures traders had been expecting the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to report a decline of 5,000 to 10,000 metric tons last week in the amount of copper stored in exchange-sanctioned warehouses. Instead, the exchange said stocks rose 125 metric tons to 70,925 metric tons. It was the first increase since Sept. 5, when the exchange reported inventories totaling 122,125 metric tons. The report startled copper traders on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex who had grown jittery after bidding the metal's spot price to an all-time high of $ 1.538 a pound last week. Copper for spot delivery settled 3.35 cents lower at $ 1.4565 a pound Monday on the Comex while the most active futures contract, for December delivery, was 3.1 cents lower at $ 1.389 a pound. The report of a 125-ton rise in copper stocks `` really caused the market to move lower,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But Ms. <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON> said the bull market's fundamental underpinnings _ tight supplies, strong demand and a 3-week-old copper miners' strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ remained in place, suggesting prices could recover and advance to new highs. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the unexpected rise in copper inventories should be viewed as a caution light. `` It is significant in that it breaks the trend of sizeable declines that's been going on for two months,'' <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. `` The slight increase should not be thrown out as something meaningless,'' he said. `` It could very well be the start of something new _ but I would n't bet the whole farm on it.'' Precious-metals prices advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> amid strong overseas buying spurred by the dollar's decline against other currencies, analysts said. Gold settled $ 1.20 to $ 1.60 higher with December at $ 424.70 a troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 7.6 cents higher with December at $ 6.53 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with grains mostly higher and soybeans mostly lower. The soybean market settled near the day's highs, though, on speculation that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was planning large purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans and soybean meal, experts said. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal. The grain markets had opened lower on disappointment about the lack of new export business. But most prices rebounded late in the session on a news report that the No. 2 official in the Soviet grain-buying agency had said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would need to buy 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans or soymeal for both February and March delivery, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There was just an explosion in the meal market in the last minute or so,'' he said. Wheat settled 1 \ cents lower to 3 \ cents higher with December at $ 4.19 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.78 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8 cents higher with December at $ 2.25 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with November at $ 7.88 -LCB- On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .28 cent higher with December at 73.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with November at 81.45 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .37 cent higher with December at 42.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .13 cent higher with February at 46.12 cents a pound. Energy futures posted moderate gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 15 cents higher at $ 14.06 barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to .37 cent higher with December at 44.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .17 cent to .91 cent higher with December at 47.25 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled 1.55 points lower at 274.70.

 Stock prices tumbled in light trading Monday as weary investors awaited the outcome of the presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 21.16 points to close the day at 2,124.64. In the broader market, declining issues outpaced advances by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,200 issues down, 314 up and 444 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 133.87 million shares, down from 143.58 million in Friday's session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 171.01 million shares. Analysts said investors withdrew from the market early, neither buying nor selling, to await the outcome of Tuesday's vote. Analysts said that while Wall Street felt relatively certain of a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory, investors were cautious after weekend polls suggested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had narrowed the gap in some areas. In addition, leftover concern from last week's unexpectedly strong unemployment data also kept investors watchful. The drop in the jobless rate revived concern that the economy is stronger than expected, signaling the possibility of higher inflation and a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit by raising interest rates. Later in the day, many observers said a no-win sentiment seemed to grip the market as investors turned to post-election concerns. `` The market has so baked <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the pie that if he is victorious, it will be anti-climactic and the market will say ` So what,''' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The big story will be after the election.'' Another analyst said investors worried that regardless of who wins the elections, concerns about the economy will persist. `` Even with a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory, we're faced with rising inflation, higher interest rates, concerns about the federal deficit _ the same questions about the economy,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` You'll have trouble finding anyone who thinks either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has developed a sense of coming to grips with these things.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks lost 1.42 to close at 154.28. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> dropped ~ point to 43 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 119 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 -RRB- at 59. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said it was spinning of its Burger King unit. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, in the middle of a takeover battle, rose 1 -RCB- to 87 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -RRB- to 51. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index closed down 2.73 to 315.36, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index lost 2.38 to finish at 273.93. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market declined 4.51 to 376.51. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 4.05 to close at 293.47. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market was $ 2,700.163 billion Monday off 26.089 billion or off 0.96 percent from Friday.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> announced Monday the sale of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for $ 170 million, almost three times what he paid for the struggling office-hotel-shopping complex when he bought it two years ago and renamed it after his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The complex was purchased by 66 <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, N.J.-based real estate investment firm. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> will use the proceeds to pay down the massive debt rung up by the $ 1.5 billion purchase in 1986 of the MGM film library. The deal includes 800,000 square feet in two office towers, one of which houses <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> studios located on balconies in the atrium between the two buildings; the 470-room <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>; 80,000 square feet of retail space; and an adjacent parking building with 2,000 spaces. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, looking for money to reduce his debt, had announced in February that the building was for sale, and within the past few months is known to have rejected a Japanese-led syndicate's offer of $ 160 million. Turner purchased the property in 1986 for $ 21.8 million in cash and assumption of $ 45 million in debt. The deal does not include <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>' operating agreement for The Omni coliseum, adjacent to the complex. `` We're going to do whatever has to be done to make it a first-class property,'' president <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the buyer's <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, offices. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> signed a 15-year lease to remain the main tenant in the complex, which will be managed by <ORGANIZATION> Tishman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the deal would be closed within 60 days. The purchase is the second major transaction this year involving a premier downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> property. In September, architect-developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> consolidated his ownership of the six-building <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> complex for $ 333 million in the city's largest-ever real estate transaction. In addition, a Japanese insurance company is believed to be near closing a $ 300 million deal for the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the city's latest showpiece skyscraper.

<HEAD>Largest Newsprint Maker Reduces, Delays Price Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's largest newsprint maker, pressured by weak demand and resistance from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspapers, said Monday it would drastically reduce and delay its latest announced price hike. <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi-Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> has told its customers it decided to increase prices for newspaper customers by $ 30 to $ 680 a metric ton effective Feb. 1 instead of the previously announced $ 695 a metric ton. But analysts said that unless two smaller U.S.-based newsprint makers announce price increases by next month, this latest rise might not occur. Last September, <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi </ORGANIZATION> announced it was raising its newsprint prices to $ 695 a metric ton, a 6.9 percent increase, effective Jan 1. Several other manufacturers, including <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer, followed suit. But newspaper officials balked, arguing that the price hikes were unjustified because of weak demand for newsprint. They said a fall in advertising meant they did not need as much paper to print their newspapers. They also said a buildup of inventories and increased capacity of paper mills starting next year meant a larger supply of newsprint would be available. `` We are obviously disappointed that our price announcement for both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have had to be modified or, I should say, has been modified,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and marketing unit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But we are obviously aware of the realities of the marketplace.'' Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> was the first to announce last week that it was cutting its previously announced price increase. But analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> started the ball rolling on Nov. 1 when they did not notify their customers that they would follow the lead of <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi </ORGANIZATION> and other bigger newsprint companies that announced their price increases in September. Under terms of their customer contracts, both companies were required to give two months notice of price hikes. Most other newsprint makers operate under contracts that require three months notice to customers. `` The only way these companies can compete is in price,'' said one Wall Street analyst who did not want to be named. `` If one company increases its price and the next does not then -LRB- the company with the higher price -RRB- will lose market share.'' The analyst said the big newsprint makers boosted prices on the assumption that fourth-quarter demand would increase. However, that has not happened and `` that's why Champion decided not to increase prices,'' he said. Analysts said that the two companies have until Dec. 1 to meet the latest price hike for their customers. If they do not, that could mean even the lower prices might not take effect, they said. `` The handwriting is on the wall,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Philo </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It looks like there will be excess capacity in the next few years.''

 <ORGANIZATION> OTASCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a 70-year-old Tulsa-based retail chain, filed for bankruptcy reorganization and has closed 170 stores in 11 states, company officials announced Monday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition was filed Sunday night in federal court in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. Company stores did not open Monday and 1,600 employees were advised they were being terminated, he said. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Otasco </PERSON>, purchased by its employees four years ago, had $ 187 million in assets and $ 163 million in liabilities, with secured debt of $ 94 million and $ 50 million in unsecured debt. He said company officials had been unable to negotiate a settlement with <PERSON> Otasco </PERSON>'s bankers. Among Otasco's largest creditors are <ORGANIZATION> Ameritrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, $ 22.6 million; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 10.5 million; <ORGANIZATION> MTD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.4 million; and <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5.8 million. <ORGANIZATION> AmeriTrust </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Monday saying it was the lead lender in an $ 86 million secured loan agreement with <LOCATION> OTASCO </LOCATION>, but that six participating lenders have assumed all but $ 22.6 million of that liability. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said the decision to file for Chapter 11 was made because the company did not have funds to purchase Christmas inventory. Otasco, which specializes in automotive products and appliances, has been struggling in recent years, in part because of the depressed oil and agriculture industries in its markets, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Otasco </PERSON> was started in 1918 and grew to a chain of more than 600 company-owned and associate stores in a 14-state area in the southeastern and south central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was purchased by <ORGANIZATION> McCrory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1961 and four years ago was bought back by employees to become the fourth-largest employee owned company in the country. The name of the company is an abbreviation for <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Tire and <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Two years ago the company undertook a restructuring plan in which it reduced debt, closed 94 unprofitable stores, liquidated a discount outlet store and consolidated warehouse and distribution facilities <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who became president and chief executive officer in 1983, said he hoped the company will be reorganized into `` a smaller company, but probably a more viable company than we have been in the past.'' About 250 employees, including managers of Otasco stores, remained on the payroll to service customer accounts during the reorganization transition, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. He said customer services would be maintained. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said he believed the company could be reorganized to pursue a new strategy that will allow it to compete with large discount store chains. In addition to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Otasco </PERSON> has stores in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

The board of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s, the nation's second-largest fried chicken chain behind <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, also indicated it had instructed management to explore alternatives to the $ 8 a share <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>'s offer, including a possible leveraged buyout, merger with another suitor or major acquisition by Church's Church's had been studying the offer Popeyes' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for about two weeks. Church's shares dipped 25 cents to $ 7.75 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Church's also announced a shareholder protection plan aimed at making a hostile takeover more difficult and said it would file a counterclaim in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> federal court to stop Popeyes from pursuing the takeover offer. Popeyes spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said the company would stand by its offer. `` We are disappointed. We still want a friendly deal and would sign a confidentiality agreement to get more information about the company,'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is we are not going away.'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said the company believed <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s legal motions were unfounded and company officials believed they could lead <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s to greater profitability. Church's officials also have filed motions in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> seeking a declaratory judgment upholding the shareholder rights plan. The shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill, enables <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders to sharply increase their holdings in the company in the event a hostile bidder acquires a stake of 20 percent or more, and to buy at a discount stock in the hostile bidder if it wins control of Church's. Such plans are aimed at making a hostile buyout prohibitively expensive. `` This is a program that's designed not to prevent a takeover, but to encourage a potential buyer to negotiate properly for the benefit of the shareholder,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer. `` It makes the potential buyer go back and do his homework on the offer and allows the board time to look at the takeover offer and not to stampede into it,'' <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said. Church's also said it would be filing an answer and counterclaims in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> federal court against <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and other individuals. The counterclaims hope to keep <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> from continuing its offer on charges that it would violate securities and antitrust laws and also alleges former Church's employees used confidential information regarding Church's. Church's, which has gone through management changes the last several years, expects sales of around $ 520 million this year from its more than 1,500 restaurants, down from about $ 570 million in 1986 and $ 633 million in 1984. Popeyes, the No. 3 chicken restaurant, expects sales of $ 485 million this year. There are 725 Popeyes restaurants nationwide, 100 of them company-owned.

<HEAD>Brennan Says Sears Stores Will Change, But Not Become `Discount'

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may be adopting a `` low-cost mentality'' under its recently-announced restructuring, but that does n't mean it will be running a chain of discount stores, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' chairman said Monday. A new policy of `` every day low pricing,'' plus other changes, will instead mean far fewer promotional sales, and in some cases fewer choices of products in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores, said company Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` We intend to take our current mix of merchandise and go to a low, every-day price strategy with that mix,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> told a group of securities analysts and reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Do n't feel like we are going to be something that looks like a discounter,'' with shopping carts and check-out counters at the doors, he said. A `` significant increase'' in the number of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> retail stores _ now about 825 _ also could occur in coming years, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> officials announced last week they would revamp merchandising and sell the 110-story <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the world's tallest building, in a bid to improve the company's earnings No buyers for the building have been announced. Company officials also revealed plans to move the company's <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> out of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, meaning 8,000 jobs could be relocated `` We would like to keep the organization here in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and we will do everything possible to make that happen,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said Monday. But he added, `` We think it's our responsibility to the shareholders to explore all options.'' The restructuring is intended to have <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> employees adopt a `` low-cost mentality,'' and `` the signal of moving our headquarters is a huge, huge step in that direction,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said at the meeting that lessening the number of promotional sales on individual items, could save the company up to $ 200 million a year through reduced paperwork, inventory handling and related costs. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the marketing strategy also should mean better return for advertising dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has said that under the restructuring, it also would buy back up to 10 percent of its stock, divest its Coldwell Banker commercial real estate subsidiary and take $ 425 million in after-tax fourth-quarter charges. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said last week that the restructuring is designed to enhance <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' value to shareholders immediately and to concentrate its resources over the longer term on consumer-oriented businesses: retailing, insurance, real estate and financial services. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also plans to continue trying out other new marketing techniques, including offering more national brands of some types of products and opening specialty stores. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> net income in the third quarter was $ 344.2 million, or 90 cents per share. That compared with $ 409 million, or $ 1.08 a share, for third-quarter 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its third quarter profit rose 22 percent from the same period last year. The company, one of the world's biggest oilfield services concerns, posted a profit of $ 25.3 million, or 24 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30. In 1987, the company reported third quarter earnings of $ 20.7 million, or 19 cents a share. Revenue during the quarter rose to $ 1.2 billion from $ 1.0 billion in the year-earlier quarter.

<HEAD>Kroger Settles With Some Shareholders in Restructuring Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had reached an out-of-court settlement with 11 of 14 shareholders who sued to block the company's $ 4.6 billion restructuring program, although three shareholders will fight the deal. The shareholders filed six class-action lawsuits after <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 15 announced plans to restructure to discourage two unsolicited takeover proposals. The suits, consolidated into one, accuse <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> executives of trying to protect their jobs by the restructuring. Under the plan, shareholders will get a special $ 40 cash dividend and a bond with a trading value of about $ 8 for each share they own. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials said they decided to settle to `` avoid further expense, inconvenience and distraction.'' The settlement, if approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, would accelerate the maturity of the bonds by two years to Oct. 15, 2006, and make other changes in how quickly <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> must redeem the bonds. It also would prohibit the company from redeeming bonds before Oct. 15, 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> will pay a premium _ in the form of a percentage of between 1 and 3 points more than face value _ on bonds it redeems between 1993 and 1996. The premium would be paid in addition to any accrued interest. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said a court hearing on the settlement should be set for mid - to late-December Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesh </PERSON>, representing three shareholders, said he would file formal objections to the settlement because it does not give shareholders any additional benefits. He said he wants further restrictions on when <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> may redeem the bonds and wants the company to pay a higher premium for redeeming them early. Mesh contended that the settlement, in which <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 1.27 million to the plaintiffs' lawyers, was `` carved out only to satisfy the attorney fees.''

 A graduate student believed responsible for a computer `` virus'' that jammed an estimated 6,000 systems nationwide last week has obtained a lawyer, and sources said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> upgraded its inquiry to a full criminal investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> computer experts said a weekend of troubleshooting left them with little evidence to conclude that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was the source of the rogue program, despite one official's comment that an early version of the program was found in <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' files. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 23, is n't saying anything publicly, other than a fleeting remark to a television station that all the attention has become `` a bit terrifying.'' The `` virus,'' so named because it multiplies after invading a computer, jammed computers across the country linked to the Pentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers by reproducing itself over and over. Those computer centers affected by the virus say it only took up memory space and did not destroy any files. A federal government source familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had decided to step up the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the case from a preliminary inquiry to a full-scale criminal investigation of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and the events surrounding the virus. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Tuesday editions, quoted law enforcement sources as saying that the inquiry had been expanded to a full field investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office. The paper said that meant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials had consulted with federal prosecutors and agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had jurisdiction and that there was reason to believe there may have been a violation of federal criminal law. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON> declined to give details on the case's progress, but said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials probably had talked with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office over the weekend. In a full-scale investigation, the government has the power to subpoena records and documents and compel testimony through the authorization of immunity, two techniques which are not permitted through preliminary inquiries. The move indicated the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was moving very quickly in the case because in many instances, preliminary inquiries take a month or more. Justice sources said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was trying on Monday to get an interview with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and apparently had not done so by the end of the day. Another government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators were not sure whether any criminal activity actually occurred, as defined by a statute passed in 1984. A section of that law says it is unlawful to enter a government computer with the intent to disrupt its functions. The crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The source said that in this case, there's no evidence that anything was taken from the computers, but rather that it was a question of disrupting computer systems. One section of law addresses sabotage, but the source said it was unclear whether the virus case would involve an intent to disrupt the computer. The source said he believed the bureau was investigating the matter in view of the fact that there were breaches of security, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will have to determine whether the matter involved criminal conduct. `` There's a lot of ambiguity'' in the matter, the source said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, firm of <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, said he had been retained to represent <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` in the so-called computer virus matter.'' `` We have notified the federal authorities of our representation and his whereabouts,'' the lawyer said. `` We are in the process of investigating the facts and circumstances which have been reported by the press in order to determine our course of action.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, has refused to say if his son created the virus. He said his son left the <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, campus last week to avoid reporters and is staying at the family's <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, home. A team of technicians at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> spent the weekend searching the computer tapes and accounts trying to track the source. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' friends have said he created the virus as an intellectual challenge and that it was supposed to lie dormant in computer systems, according to several news accounts of the incursion. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose Wednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering his mistake, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus' spread He called <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Aiken Computation Lab early Thursday after realizing there was an error in the program he had intended to be harmless, said ndrew <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>, a programmer at the lab. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did his undergraduate studies at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was extremely shocked and tired,'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimson </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Monday. `` His tone was very sober.'' Computer security consultants said they had received far more inquiries than usual since last week. However, they said computer security troubles can not be solved with passwords and installing anti-viral software. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a computer security consultant in <LOCATION> Tappan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate the challenge. `` The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, ` Why do n't you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves from viruses?' he said.
